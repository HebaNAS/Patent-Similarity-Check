      "Cancer has a major impact on society in across the globe. In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States alone, and 595,690 people will die from the disease. By 2020, 18.2 million Americans, roughly 1 in 19 people, will be cancer patients or cancer survivors, up from 11.7 million (1 in 26) in 2005, according to the Journal of Oncology Practice (Erikson 2007). Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are recombinant receptors for antigen, which, in a single molecule, redirect the specificity and function of T cells and other immune cells. Their use in cancer immunotherapy can be to rapidly generate tumor-targeted T cells, bypassing the obstacles of active immunization. Once expressed in cells, the CAR-modified cell may exert both immediate and long-term effects in a subject. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, which edits a cancer patient's T cells to recognize their tumors, has shown to be effective for treating blood cancers. In recent clinical trials, CAR T cell therapy has dramatically improved the outcomes of blood cancer patients with advanced, otherwise untreatable forms of leukemia and lymphoma. In contract, CAR T cells face a unique set of challenges in the context of solid tumors. Amongst the challenges include the identification of an antigen whose expression clearly demarcates tumor from normal tissue and establishing effective killing of tumor cells within a tumor and hence reduction of tumor size. \n"

      "Procalcitonin (PCT) has become a well-established biomarker for sepsis diagnosis: PCT reflects the severity of bacterial infection and is in particular used to monitor progression of infection into sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. PCT concentrations in sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock are typically above 1 ng/mL. It is possible to use PCT to measure the activity of the infection-associated systemic inflammatory response, to control success of therapy, and to estimate prognosis (Assicot M et al.: High serum procalcitonin concentrations in patients with sepsis and infection. Lancet 1993, 341:515-8; Clec'h C et al.: Diagnostic and prognostic value of procalcitonin in patients with septic shock. Crit Care Med 2004; 32:1166-9; Lee Y J et al.: Predictive comparisons of procalcitonin (PCT) level, arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR), APACHE III score and multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS) in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), Yonsei Med J 2004, 45, 29-37; Meisner M.: Biomarkers of sepsis: clinically useful? Curr Opin Crit Care 2005, 11, 473-480; Wunder C et al.: Are IL-6, IL-10 and PCT plasma concentrations reliable for outcome prediction in severe sepsis? A comparison with APACHE III and SAPS II. Inflamm Res 2004, 53, 158-163). The increase of PCT levels in patients with sepsis correlates with mortality (Oberhoffer M et al.: Outcome prediction by traditional and new biomarkers of inflammation in patients with sepsis. Clin Chem Lab Med 1999; 37:363-368). An increasing number of studies discusses the potential role of PCT in non-septic infectious diseases like pneumonia, bacterial meningitis and malaria (Bugden S A et al.: The potential role of procalcitonin in the emergency department management of febrile young adults during a sustained meningococcal epidemic. Emerg Med Australas 2004, 16, 114-119; Chiwakata C B et al.: Procalcitonin as a parameter of disease severity and risk of mortality in patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. J Infect Dis 2001, 183, 1161-1164; Schwarz S et al.: Serum procalcitonin levels in bacterial and abacterial meningitis, Crit Care Med 2000, 28, 1828-1832). In vitro-studies showed that PCT plays an important role during monocyte adhesion and migration and further has an effect on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression (Linscheid P et al.: Expression and secretion of procalcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide by adherent monocytes and by macrophage-activated adipocytes, Crit Care Med 2004, 32, 1715-1721; Wiedermann F J et al.: Migration of human monocytes in response to procalcitonin, Crit Care Med, 2002, 30, 1112-1117; Hoffmann G et al.: Procalcitonin amplifies inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression and nitric oxide production in vascular smooth muscle cells, Crit Care Med, 2002, 30, 2091-2095.). PCT has been used to guide antibiotic therapy (Christ-Crain M et al.: Effect of procalcitonin-guided treatment on antibiotic use and outcome in lower respiratory tract infections: cluster-randomised, single-blinded intervention trial, Lancet. 2004 Feb. 21; 363(9409):600-7.): In patients with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections presenting at the emergency department PCT was measured, and only patients with PCT concentrations >0.25 ng/mL or >0.5 ng/mL were treated with antibiotics. Apparently, this regimen led to a clinical outcome undistinguishable from the control group, in which also many patients with PCT concentrations <0.25 ng/mL received antibiotics. Of note, in this study, patients with relevant comorbidities as for instance heart failure were excluded. Thus, it is unclear so far, whether the presence of a primary disease in addition to an infection should influence the interpretation of PCT concentrations below 0.25 ng/mL. A relevant primary disease might put an additional burden on the immune system, and biomarkers of infection, such as PCT, in such situation might be indicative of an infection in a different, i.e. lower, concentration range than in the absence of a relevant primary disease. In healthy individuals, the PCT concentration is well below 0.25 ng/mL: The median concentration has been determined to be 0.014 ng/mL (Morgenthaler N G et al.: Sensitive immunoluminometric assay for the detection of procalcitonin. Clin Chem. 2002 May; 48(5):788-90.) A method for diagnosis of infections or inflammatory diseases of the airways and lungs with associated heart failure, wherein the biomarker procalcitonin is determined in a patient, is described in WO 2008/040328 A2. \n"

      "This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/383,330, filed Sep. 2, 2016, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD Provided herein are cyclic peptide analogs, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of treating cancer with such compounds. BACKGROUND Cancer is a serious and debilitating disease brought on by abnormal and unchecked cell division in a patient. Current treatment strategies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. These treatment options may be singular treatments or combined for a more effective regimen. Unfortunately, many patients do not respond well to current chemotherapeutic regimens or develop resistance after prolonged treatment. In addition, for many chemotherapeutics, there is a maximal lifetime level of drug that a patient may be administered. In this case, new drugs must be tried. Thus, there is a need for development of new and varied chemotherapeutic compounds to assist in the treatment of cancer. An important aspect of cancer, as opposed to infection caused by an exogenous pathogen for example, is that the disease is caused by cells already existing in the patient. These cells are similar in many ways to healthy tissue and reside among healthy cells in the patient. Thus, chemotherapeutic compounds, even if directly administered to a tumor, run the risk of entering and affecting healthy tissue in addition to cancerous tissue. This non-specific delivery can cause systemic and serious side effects in a patient including nausea, weakness, bleeding problems, infection, and hair loss. To avoid these systemic effects, chemotherapeutic compounds may be conjugated to a targeting molecule that assists with the specific and direct delivery of a chemotherapeutic compound to cancerous tissue only, preventing delivery to healthy tissue. These drugs may be associated with fewer and less severe side effects than traditional therapy, and so there is a need to develop chemotherapeutics that are effective in isolation, but are also suitable for conjugation to a targeting molecule. Various types of agents have been described for use in treatment of cancer. Many of these compounds pose challenges. For instance, many compounds described for use in treatment of cancer have problems associated with toxicity. Some compounds present challenges related to their chemical synthesis. There are also challenges associated with finding appropriate permutations of therapeutic agents for combination therapy. Furthermore, only a minority of agents identified for use in treatment of cancer are suitable for conjugation to a targeting moiety. Accordingly, there remains a need for new compounds and conjugates for use in treatment of cancer. SUMMARY In one aspect, provided is a compound of Formula (I): \n",

      " DETAILED DESCRIPTION Definitions As used herein, reference to “about” a value or parameter herein includes (and describes) embodiments that are directed to that value or parameter per se. For example, description referring to “about X” includes description of “X”. Unless clearly indicated otherwise, “an individual” as used herein intends a mammal, including but not limited to a human, bovine, primate, equine, canine, feline, porcine, and ovine animals. Thus, the compositions and methods provided herein have use in both human medicine and in the veterinary context, including use in agricultural animals and domestic pets. The individual may be a human who has been diagnosed with or is suspected of having a condition described herein, such as cancer. The individual may be a human who exhibits one or more symptoms associated with a condition described herein, such as cancer. The individual may be a human who has a mutated or abnormal gene associated with a condition described herein, such as cancer. The individual may be a human who is genetically or otherwise predisposed to or at risk of developing a condition described herein, such as cancer. As used herein, “treatment” or “treating” is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including clinical results. For purposes of the compositions and methods provided herein, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the condition, diminishing the extent of the condition, stabilizing the condition (e.g., preventing or delaying the worsening of the condition), preventing or delaying the spread (e.g., metastasis) of the condition, delaying or slowing the progression of the condition, ameliorating a disease state, providing a remission (whether partial or total) of a disease, decreasing the dose of one or more other medications required to treat the condition, enhancing the effect of another medication used to treat the condition, increasing the quality of life of an individual having the condition, and/or prolonging survival. A method of treating cancer encompasses a reduction of the pathological consequence of cancer. The methods described herein contemplate any one or more of these aspects of treatment. As used herein, an “at risk” individual is an individual who is at risk of developing a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer. An individual “at risk” may or may not have detectable disease, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease prior to the treatment methods described herein. “At risk” denotes that an individual has one or more so-called risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing the disease or condition than an individual without these risk factor(s). As used herein, by “combination therapy” is meant a therapy that includes two or more different compounds. Thus, in one aspect, a combination therapy comprising a compound detailed herein and another compound is provided. In some variations, the combination therapy optionally includes one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, non-pharmaceutically active compounds, and/or inert substances. In various embodiments, treatment with a combination therapy may result in an additive or even synergistic (e.g., greater than additive) result compared to administration of a single compound provided herein alone. In some embodiments, a lower amount of each compound is used as part of a combination therapy compared to the amount generally used for individual therapy. Preferably, the same or greater therapeutic benefit is achieved using a combination therapy than by using any of the individual compounds alone. In some embodiments, the same or greater therapeutic benefit is achieved using a smaller amount (e.g., a lower dose or a less frequent dosing schedule) of a compound in a combination therapy than the amount generally used for individual compound or therapy. Preferably, the use of a small amount of compound results in a reduction in the number, severity, frequency, and/or duration of one or more side-effects associated with the compound. As used herein, the term “effective amount” intends such amount of a compound provided herein which in combination with its parameters of efficacy and toxicity, should be effective in a given therapeutic form. As is understood in the art, an effective amount may be in one or more doses, i.e., a single dose or multiple doses may be required to achieve the desired treatment endpoint. An effective amount may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable or beneficial result may be or is achieved. Suitable doses of any of the co-administered compounds may optionally be lowered due to the combined action (e.g., additive or synergistic effects) of the compounds. In various embodiments, an effective amount of the composition or therapy may (i) reduce the number of cancer cells; (ii) reduce tumor size; (iii) inhibit, retard, slow to some extent, and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; (iv) inhibit (e.g., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; (v) inhibit tumor growth; (vi) prevent or delay occurrence and/or recurrence of a tumor; and/or (vii) relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. In various embodiments, the amount is sufficient to ameliorate, palliate, lessen, and/or delay one or more of symptoms of a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer. As is understood in the art, an “effective amount” may be in one or more doses, i.e., a single dose or multiple doses may be required to achieve the desired treatment endpoint. An effective amount may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable or beneficial result may be or is achieved. A “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of a compound or salt thereof sufficient to produce a desired therapeutic outcome (e.g., reducing the severity or duration of, stabilizing the severity of, or eliminating one or more symptoms of a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer). For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include, e.g., decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the disease (biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral), including its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease or condition, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease or condition, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease or condition, enhancing effect of another medication, delaying the progression of the disease or condition, and/or prolonging survival of patients. It is understood that an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, including a prophylactically effective amount, may be given to an individual in the adjuvant setting, which refers to a clinical setting in which an individual has had a history of cancer, and generally (but not necessarily) has been responsive to therapy, which includes, but is not limited to, surgery (e.g., surgical resection), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, because of their history of cancer, these individuals are considered at risk of developing cancer. Treatment or administration in the “adjuvant setting” refers to a subsequent mode of treatment. As used herein, by “pharmaceutically acceptable” or “pharmacologically acceptable” is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, e.g., the material may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition administered to a patient without causing any significant undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the composition in which it is contained. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients have preferably met the required standards of toxicological and manufacturing testing and/or are included on the Inactive Ingredient Guide prepared by the U.S. Food and Drug administration. “Pharmaceutically acceptable salts” are those salts which retain at least some of the biological activity of the free (non-salt) compound and which can be administered as drugs or pharmaceuticals to an individual. Such salts, for example, include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. Acceptable organic bases include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared in situ in the manufacturing process, or by separately reacting a purified compound provided herein in its free acid or base form with a suitable organic or inorganic base or acid, respectively, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. The term “excipient” as used herein means an inert or inactive substance that may be used in the production of a drug or pharmaceutical, such as a tablet containing a compound provided herein as an active ingredient. Various substances may be embraced by the term excipient, including without limitation any substance used as a binder, disintegrant, coating, compression/encapsulation aid, cream or lotion, lubricant, solutions for parenteral administration, materials for chewable tablets, sweetener or flavoring, suspending/gelling agent, or wet granulation agent. Binders include, e.g., carbomers, povidone, xanthan gum, etc.; coatings include, e.g., cellulose acetate phthalate, ethylcellulose, gellan gum, maltodextrin, enteric coatings, etc.; compression/encapsulation aids include, e.g., calcium carbonate, dextrose, fructose dc (dc=“directly compressible”), honey dc, lactose (anhydrate or monohydrate; optionally in combination with aspartame, cellulose, or microcrystalline cellulose), starch dc, sucrose, etc.; disintegrants include, e.g., croscarmellose sodium, gellan gum, sodium starch glycolate, etc.; creams or lotions include, e.g., maltodextrin, carrageenans, etc.; lubricants include, e.g., magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, etc.; materials for chewable tablets include, e.g., dextrose, fructose dc, lactose (monohydrate, optionally in combination with aspartame or cellulose), etc.; suspending/gelling agents include, e.g., carrageenan, sodium starch glycolate, xanthan gum, etc.; sweeteners include, e.g., aspartame, dextrose, fructose dc, sorbitol, sucrose dc, etc.; and wet granulation agents include, e.g., calcium carbonate, maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose. etc. “Alkyl” refers to and includes saturated linear or branched univalent hydrocarbon structures and combinations thereof.

Ligands The term “ligand” as used herein refers to any molecule or moiety connected to the compounds described herein. “Ligand” may refer to one or more ligands attached to a compound. Likewise, multiple compounds may be attached to a single ligand. Ligands may serve a number of purposes including facilitating uptake of the conjugate into a target cell or tissue and directing the conjugate to a particular cell or tissue (also referred to as conjugate targeting). A ligand may also serve to enhance the efficacy of the compounds by, for example, inhibiting or interacting with cellular factors that may inhibit or reduce the efficacy of the compounds described herein. The compound as described herein may be conjugated to one or more ligands. The term “ligand” as used herein refers to one or more ligands. In some embodiments, a ligand is an antibody, or fragment thereof. In other embodiments, the ligand is a peptide or protein. In yet other embodiments, the ligand is another moiety useful for directing the compounds described herein to a target cell or tissue. Antibody ligands include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, multivalent antibodies, humanized antibodies, and antibody fragments. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment(s). In one embodiment the term “antibody” encompasses a molecule comprising at least one variable region from a light chain immunoglobulin molecule and at least one variable region from a heavy chain molecule that in combination form a specific binding site for the target antigen. In one embodiment, the antibody is an IgG antibody. For example, the antibody is an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 antibody. The term “monoclonal antibody,” as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies. A monoclonal antibody composition typically displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. In contrast, polyclonal antibody compositions typically include a multitude of antibodies that may be directed against different epitopes of the same target molecule. A polyclonal antibody composition may contain a plurality of monoclonal antibodies with different epitope specificities, affinities, or avidities within a single antigen that contains multiple antigenic epitopes. The term “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with any of the compositions, uses, or methods described herein may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) Nature 256: 495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clarkson et al. (1991) Nature 352: 624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597, for example. As used herein, the term “humanized antibody” refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies as well as human antibodies. These antibodies retain the activity of a non-human antibody while being less immunogenic in humans. Humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies which contain at least part of its sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all the non-human CDR regions, while the remaining parts of the antibody may be replaced by the corresponding human counterparts. In some embodiments, the humanized antibody retains at least one complete non-human variable domain. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Queen et al. (1989) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033; and Antibody Engineering: A Practical Approach (Oxford University Press 1996). The term “recombinant antibody”, as used herein, includes all human and non-human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) or a hybridoma prepared therefrom, antibodies isolated from a host cell transformed to express the antibody, e.g., from a transfectoma, antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial antibody library, and antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of all or a portion of a human immunoglobulin gene, sequences to other DNA sequences. Exemplary peptide or protein ligands include receptor ligands for targeting delivery of the conjugate to a particular cell. Receptor ligands may engage with their target receptor and provide specific targeting to a tissue or cell type that expresses that receptor. This receptor engagement may also facilitate cellular uptake of the conjugate. Exemplary peptides may also include targeting peptides to facilitate passage across the cell membrane or intracellular targeting including, but not limited to, targeting to organelles such as the nucleus, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, and mitochondria. In some embodiments, the ligand is an antibody that is specific for a cancer cell antigen. A “cancer cell antigen” is a peptide or molecular moiety expressed by a cancer cell that is recognized by an antibody. Antibodies specific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. In additional embodiments, the peptide ligand is an interferon, a lymphokine, or a hormone. Additional exemplary ligands include nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, RNA, PNA, etc.) or other molecules known in the art that would be useful for conjugation to the presently described compounds. Linkers In one embodiment, the compounds described herein comprise one or more linker or linking group. The term “linker”, “linker molecule”, “linking group”, or “linker moiety” as used herein refers to a chemical moiety comprising a covalent bond and/or a chain of atoms that covalently attaches a ligand to a drug moiety or other molecule. For example, exemplary linkers, including their structure and synthesis, are described in WO 2004/010957, U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2006/0074008, U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2005/0238649, and U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2006/0024317, U.S. Pat. Publ. Nos. 2003/0083263, 2005/0238649 and 2005/0009751, WO 2015/095755, W. C. Widdison et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 2015, 26, 2261; D. Shabat et al., New J. Chem., 2012, 36, 386; F. M. H. de Groot et al., J. Org. Chem., 2001, 66, 8815; J. M. DeSimone et al., Med. Chem. Comm., 2014, 5, 1355; and R. M. Garbaccio et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 2016, 138(4), 1430, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. The linker may be cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers are typically cleavable under intracellular conditions, such that the linker itself is degraded and releases the compound from the ligand. Non-cleavable linkers do not degrade intracellularly and in this embodiment, the compound is released from the ligand via degradation of the ligand. A conjugate as described herein may or may not comprise a linker molecule or moiety. A person of skill in the art could determine the appropriate type of linker based on the type of treatment or tissue being targeted by the conjugate. Exemplary linking moieties include hydrazones, peptides, chelating agents, maleimides, disufide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase labile groups, as known to one of skill in the art. Linker moieties may comprise a divalent radical such as an alkyldiyl, an arylene, a heteroarylene, moieties such as: —(CR2)nO(CR2)n—, repeating units of alkyloxy (e.g. polyethylenoxy, PEG, polymethyleneoxy) and alkylamino (e.g. polyethyleneamino, Jeffamine™); and diacid ester and amides including succinate, succinamide, diglycolate, malonate, and caproamide. Cleavable linkers may be cleaved or degraded by a cleaving agent (e.g. a protease or reducing agent) present in the intracellular environment. In some embodiments, the linker is a peptidyl linker that is cleaved by an intracellular peptidase or protease enzyme, including, but not limited to, a lysosomal or endosomal protease. In some embodiments, the peptidyl linker is at least two amino acids long. Protein and peptide cleaving agents can include cathepsins B and D and plasmin, all of which are known to cleave dipeptides resulting in the release of active drug inside target cells (see, e.g., Dubowchik and Walker (1999) Pharm. Therapeutics 83:67-123). For example, a peptidyl linker that is cleavable by the thiol-dependent protease cathepsin-B, which is highly expressed in cancerous tissue, can be used (e.g., a Phe-Leu containing linker). Other examples of such linkers are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. In a specific embodiment, the peptidyl linker cleavable by an intracellular protease is a Val-Cit linker or a Phe-Lys linker (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, which describes the synthesis of doxorubicin with the val-cit linker). A cleavable linker may be fully cleaved by a cleaving agent to release the compound to which it is bound. Alternatively, a cleavable linker may be partially cleaved, such that a portion of the linker remains bound to the compound. For example, if a linker is bound to a compound via a group —C(O)N(CH3)CH2CH2N(CH3)—, the linker may be partially cleaved such that group —C(O)N(CH3)CH2CH2NHCH3 remains bound to the compound. In other embodiments, the cleavable linker is pH-sensitive. Typically, the pH-sensitive linker is unstable and degrades under acidic conditions. For example, an acid-labile linker that is cleavable in the lysosome (e.g., a hydrazone, semicarbazone, thiosemicarbazone, cis-aconitic amide, orthoester, acetal, ketal, or the like) can be used. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,122,368; 5,824,805; 5,622,929; Dubowchik and Walker (1999) Pharm. Therapeutics 83:67-123; Neville et al. (1989) Biol. Chem. 264:14653-14661.) Such linkers are relatively stable under neutral pH conditions, such as those in the blood, but are unstable at below pH 5.5 or 5.0, the approximate pH of the lysosome. Typically, the linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment. As used herein, “not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment,” in the context of a linker, means that no more than about 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, or 1% of the linkers, in a sample of compound-ligand conjugate compound, are cleaved when the antibody-drug conjugate compound is in an extracellular environment. Whether a linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment can be determined using methods known to those of skill in the relevant art. In some embodiments, the linker contains a spacer unit. In some embodiments, the spacer unit contains a para-aminobenzoate (PAB) moiety. In some embodiments, the linker contains a stretcher unit. In some embodiments, the stretcher unit contains a maleimide moiety. In some embodiments, the linking groups will be bifunctional, meaning they comprise two reactive sites, wherein a first reactive site may be bound to the compounds described herein and the second reactive site may be bound to the ligand. The linker may be hetero-bifunctional, indicating that the binding moieties on either end of the linker moiety are different. In some embodiments, conjugates of the ligand and compound are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidoberizoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al (1987) Science, 238:1098. Carbon-14-labeled 1 -isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the compound or ligand (WO94/11026). The compounds described herein can be linked to ligands via an acid labile linker as previously described (Blattler et al, 24 Biochemistry, 1517-1524 (1985), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,542,225, 4,569,789 and 4,764,368). The compounds described herein can be linked to ligands via a photolabile linker as previously described (Senter et al, 42 Photochemistry and Photobiology, 231-237 (1985), U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,014). The compounds described herein can be linked to a ligand to produce a conjugate that can be cleaved by intracellular esterases to liberate free drug. (For examples see: U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 and Aboud-Pirak et al, 38 Biochem. Pharmacol., 641-648 (1989), Laguzza et al, 32 J. Med. Chem., 549-555 (1989)). The compounds described herein can also be linked to ligands via peptide spacer linkers. It has been previously shown that short peptide spacers between drugs and macromolecular carriers are stable in serum but are readily hydrolyzed by intracellular lysosomal peptidases (Trouet et al, 79 Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. 626-629 (1982)). Functional groups on the compound that can serve as a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand using the coupling methods described herein include, without limitation, —OH, —NHR, —NHNH2, —ONH2, —SH, —CO2H, and other functional groups. In any of the variations of Formulae (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), and (Ie) described herein, the compound may be modified to contain one or more functional groups that can serve as a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand at any chemically feasible position. In some embodiments, any of the variations of Formulae (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), and (Ic) may contain one or more moieties selected from the group consisting of —OH, —NHR, —NHNH2, —ONH2, —N3, —SH, —CO2H at any chemically feasible position. In some embodiments, a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand can be located on an amino acid side chain. In other embodiments, a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand can be located at position Y4. In other embodiments, a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand can be located at positions R2, R8a, R8b, R15, or R4. In some variations the linker is of formula (L-Fn), where the linker is bonded to a compound provided herein via the bond shown as \n",

General Synthetic Methods Compounds of Formula (I) will now be described by reference to illustrative synthetic schemes for their general preparation below and the specific examples that follow. Artisans will recognize that, to obtain the various compounds herein, starting materials may be suitably selected so that the ultimately desired substituents will be carried through the reaction scheme with or without protection as appropriate to yield the desired product. Alternatively, it may be necessary or desirable to employ, in the place of the ultimately desired substituent, a suitable group that may be carried through the reaction scheme and replaced as appropriate with the desired substituent. In addition, one of skill in the art will recognize that protecting groups may be used to protect certain functional groups (amino, carboxy, or side chain groups) from reaction conditions, and that such groups are removed under standard conditions when appropriate. Unless otherwise specified, the variables are as defined above in reference to Formula (I). Where it is desired to obtain a particular enantiomer of a compound, this may be accomplished from a corresponding mixture of enantiomers using any suitable conventional procedure for separating or resolving enantiomers. Thus, for example, diastereomeric derivatives may be produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers, e.g. a racemate, and an appropriate chiral compound. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallization and the desired enantiomer recovered. In another resolution process, a racemate may be separated using chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Alternatively, if desired a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropriate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described. Chromatography, recrystallization and other conventional separation procedures may also be used with intermediates or final products where it is desired to obtain a particular isomer of a compound or to otherwise purify a product of a reaction. General methods of preparing compounds described herein are depicted in exemplified methods below. Variable groups in the schemes provided herein are defined as for Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId), (IIe), (III), (IIIa), (IIIb), (IIIc), (IIId), (IIIe), (IV), (IVa), (IVb), (IVc), (IVd), (IVe), or any variation thereof.

Example 69 Synthesis of Conjugate C23 To the solution of Intermediate-6 (Ab-Linker-1, 0.5 mg, 50 μL) diluted in PBS (50 uL) was added (2R,5S,8R14S,17S,20S,21S,22S,E)-20-((E)-but-2-en-2-yl)-14-((R)-sec-butyl)-8-(4-chlorobenzyl)-2-isobutyl-5,7,10,17,21,25-hexamethyl-3,6,9,12,15,18,26-heptaoxo-1,19-dioxa-4,7,10,13,16-pentaazacyclohexacos-24-en-22-yl (5-((((((5-((((4-((2R)-2-((2R)-2-(((((E)-cyclooct-4-en-1-yl)oxy)carbonyl)amino)-3-methylbutanamido)-5-ureidopentanamido)benzyl)oxy)carbonyl)amino)pentyl)oxy)(hydroxy)phosphoryl)oxy)(hydro xy)phosphoryl)oxy)pentyl)carbamate (conjugate L23, 3.3 μmol, 1 μL) and shaken for 15 min and the solution was run through spin column to remove the excess of reagent to afford Conjugate C23. Example 70 Synthesis of Conjugates C24, C25, and C26 The antibody-drug conjugates C24-26, wherein Ab is Trastuzumab Biosimilar (TBS) antibody, were synthesized using protocols similar to methods described previously (Ref: Bryant, P. et al, Mol. Pharmaceuticals, 2015, 12, 1872-1879). Briefly, the purified antibody, Trastuzumab Biosimilar (TBS, 1-2 mg) was buffer exchanged with PBS (1× solution, pH 7.5) and EDTA (20 mM) mix and diluted to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. A stock solution of TCEP (1 mM) was freshly prepared in PBS, and 6 molar equiv. (relative to the antibody concentration) was added to the antibody and left the mixture on a heat block. After 1 h, the partially reduced antibody was removed from the heat block and cooled to room temperature. A stock solution of Conjugate L24, L25, and L26 (5 mM in DMSO) was freshly prepared, and 6-8 molar equiv was added to the antibody. The reaction was incubated at RT for 15-20 h under mild agitation. Then the reaction mixture was passed through a spin column (Zeba, 2 mL) to remove small MW reagents and buffer exchanged by ultrafiltration (10 kDa MWCO) into PBS to afford the ADC, C24-C27 in PBS. The resulting ADC had an average DAR around 4 by HIC. The aggregation was measured by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and it was less than 1%. Example 71 Synthesis of Conjugates C29 and C31 The antibody-drug conjugates C29 and C31 is synthesized from L29 and L31 respectively, using protocols similar to methods described previously (Ref Doronina, S. O. et al, Bioconjugate Chem. 2008, 19 (10), 1960-1963). Example B1 Inhibitory Response of Test Compounds Against BT-474 and HCC1954 Cells BT-474 human mammary gland ductal carcinoma cells were seeded in a clear polystyrene 96-well microculture plate (Corning® Costar® 96-well flat bottom plate, Cat. #3997) in a total volume of 90 μL/well. After 24 hours of incubation in a humidified incubator at 37° C. with 5% CO2 and 95% air, 10 μL of 10×, serially diluted test agents in growth medium were added to each well (10 pt dose response curve, highest concentration 10 μM of test agent). After 72 hours of culture in a humidified incubator at 37° C., in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air, the plated cells and Cell Titer-Glo® (Protnega G7571) reagents were brought to room temperature to equilibrate for 30 minutes. 100 μL of Cell Titer-Glo® reagent was added to each well. The plate was shaken for two minutes and then left to equilibrate for ten minutes. The media/Cell Titer-Glo® reagent was transferred to a white polystyrene 96-well microculture plate (Corning® Costar® 96-well flat bottom plate, Cat. #3917) before reading luminescence on a Tecan GENios microplate reader. Percent inhibition of cell growth was calculated relative to untreated control wells. The IC50 value for the test agents was determined using Prism 6.05 by curve-fitting of the data using the following four parameter-logistic equation: \n",

      "The present invention is based on the surprising finding that in samples of patients with a primary, non-infectious disease, slightly elevated procalcitonin (PCT) levels (concentrations) have been detected at a large frequency and are of diagnostic relevance. Remarkably, the inventors have identified a large number of samples having serum levels above 0.03 ng/mL (26.0%) and 0.05 ng/mL (14.7%), respectively, from a total of 4997 samples of patients having a primary, non-infectious disease. Slightly elevated PCT levels relate to PCT levels in the range of from about 0.02 to 0.25 ng/mL, preferably between about 0.02 and 0.1 ng/mL. The presence of slightly elevated PCT levels may be indicative for the risk of a patient having a non-infectious primary disease to acquire a yet clinically unmanifested and/or yet asymptomatic further disease or medical condition. Such a further disease or medical condition may be related to a local infection or the local infection may facilitate, accelerate and/or enhance the risk of contracting or acquiring the further disease or medical condition. The present invention provides a method for the prognosis of a patient's risk to acquire a further disease or medical condition in addition to an non-infectious primary disease. This also allows for adaption of the treatment of these patients, e.g. by an additional antibiotics therapy which the patient would not have necessarily received if the elevated PCT level had not been detected. It has to be noted that so far, patients with non-infectious primary diseases are not routinely screened for their PCT levels during diagnosis. It is taught by the present invention that patients with a primary disease not being an infection should be assayed for their PCT level to allow for the prognosis of the risk to acquire a further disease or medical condition and ultimately to allow for the adaption of therapy. Hence, the present invention provides an in vitro method for prognosis for a patient having a primary disease not being an infection, the method comprising: determining the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, preferably more than 50 amino acids in length, more preferably more than 110 amino acids in length, in a sample obtained from said patient; and correlating said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof to a risk of the patient to contract a further disease or medical condition which has not yet been manifested and/or is not yet symptomatic. \n",

      "The following description and examples illustrate embodiments of the disclosure in detail. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein and as such can vary. Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are numerous variations and modifications of the disclosure, which are encompassed within its scope. Unless otherwise indicated, any embodiment can be combined with any other embodiment. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, some inventive embodiments herein contemplate numerical ranges. A variety of aspects of this invention can be presented in a range format. It should be understood that the description in range format is merely for convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an inflexible limitation on the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the description of a range should be considered to have specifically disclosed all the possible subranges as well as individual numerical values within that range as if explicitly written out. For example, description of a range such as from 1 to 6 should be considered to have specifically disclosed subranges such as from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 5, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 6, from 3 to 6 etc., as well as individual numbers within that range, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This applies regardless of the breadth of the range. When ranges are present, the ranges include the range endpoints. Definitions As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, the article “a” means one or more unless explicitly otherwise provided for. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, terms such as “contain,” “containing,” “include,” “including,” and the like mean “comprising”. The term “activation” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a process whereby a cell transitions from a resting state to an active state. This process can comprise a response to an antigen, migration, and/or a phenotypic or genetic change to a functionally active state. For example, the term “activation” can refer to the stepwise process of T cell activation. For example, a T cell can require at least two signals to become fully activated. The first signal can occur after engagement of a TCR by the antigen-MHC complex, and the second signal can occur by engagement of co-stimulatory molecules (Table 3). Anti-CD3 can mimic the first signal and anti-CD28 can mimic the second signal in vitro. For example, an engineered T cell can be activated by an expressed CAR. T cell activation” or T cell triggering, as used herein, can refer to the state of a T cell that has been sufficiently stimulated to induce detectable cellular proliferation, cytokine production and/or detectable effector function. The term “antigen binding unit” as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin molecule and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen-binding site which specifically binds (“immunoreacts with”) an antigen. Also encompassed within the term “antigen binding unit” are immunoglobulin molecules of a variety of species origins including invertebrates and vertebrates. Structurally, the simplest naturally occurring antibody (e.g., IgG) comprises four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. The immunoglobulins represent a large family of molecules that include several types of molecules, such as IgD, IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE. The term “immunoglobulin molecule” includes, for example, hybrid antibodies, or altered antibodies, and fragments thereof. It has been shown that the antigen binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a naturally-occurring antibody. These fragments are collectively termed “antigen-binding units”. Also encompassed within the term “antigen binding unit” is any polypeptide chain-containing molecular structure that has a specific shape which fits to and recognizes an epitope, where one or more non-covalent binding interactions stabilize the complex between the molecular structure and the epitope. An antigen binding unit “specifically binds to” or “immunoreactive with” an antigen if it binds with greater affinity or avidity than it binds to other reference antigens including polypeptides or other substances. “Antigen” as used herein means a substance that is recognized and bound specifically by an antigen binding unit. Antigens can include peptides, proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, and lipids; portions thereof and combinations thereof. Non-limiting exemplary antigen included GPC3 from human, murine, and other homologues thereof. “Antigen” can also refer to a molecule that provokes the immune response. This immune response may involve either antibody production, or the activation of specific immunologically-competent cells, or both. The skilled artisan will understand that any macromolecule, including virtually all proteins or peptides, can serve as an antigen. The term “immunoglobulin” or “Ig”, as used herein can refer to a class of proteins, which function as antibodies. Antibodies expressed by B cells are sometimes referred to as the chimeric antigen receptor or antigen receptor. The five members included in this class of proteins are IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgE, of which IgG is the most common circulating antibody. It is the most efficient immunoglobulin in agglutination, complement fixation, and other antibody responses, and is important in defense against bacteria and viruses. For example, a tumor cell antigen can be recognized by a CAR. The term “anti-GPC3 antibody” can refer to an antibody or antibody binding site that is capable of binding GPC3 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful for distinguishing GPC3 from other antigens expressed by a cell. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti-GPC3 antibody to an unrelated, non-GPC3 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to GPC3 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to GPC3 can have a dissociation constant (Kd) of <1 μM, <100 nM, <10 nM, <5 nM, <4 nM, <3 nM, <2 nM, <1 nM, <0.1 nM, <0.01 nM, or <0.001 nM (e.g., 10−8M or less, e.g. from 10−8 M to 10−13 M, e.g., from 10−9M to 10−13 M). In certain embodiments, an anti-GPC3 antibody binds to an epitope of GPC3 that is conserved among GPC3 from different species. The term “autologous” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to as originating from the same being. For example, a sample (e.g., cells) can be removed, processed, and given back to the same subject (e.g., patient) at a later time. An autologous process is distinguished from an allogenic process where the donor and the recipient are different subjects. “Xenotransplantation” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can encompass any procedure that involves transplantation, implantation, or infusion of cells, tissues, or organs into a recipient, where the recipient and donor are different species. Transplantation of the cells, organs, and/or tissues described herein can be used for xenotransplantation in into humans. Xenotransplantation includes but is not limited to vascularized xenotransplant, partially vascularized xenotransplant, unvascularized xenotransplant, xenodressings, xenobandages, and xenostructures. “Allotransplantation” and its grammatical equivalents (e.g., allogenic transplantation) as used herein can encompass any procedure that involves transplantation, implantation, or infusion of cells, tissues, or organs into a recipient, where the recipient and donor are the same species but different individuals. Transplantation of the cells, organs, and/or tissues described herein can be used for allotransplantation into humans. Allotransplantation includes but is not limited to vascularized allotransplant, partially vascularized allotransplant, unvascularized allotransplant, allodressings, allobandages, and allostructures. “Autotransplantation” and its grammatical equivalents (e.g., autologous transplantation) as used herein can encompass any procedure that involves transplantation, implantation, or infusion of cells, tissues, or organs into a recipient, where the recipient and donor is the same individual. Transplantation of the cells, organs, and/or tissues described herein can be used for autotransplantation into humans. Autotransplantation includes but is not limited to vascularized autotransplantation, partially vascularized autotransplantation, unvascularized autotransplantation, autodressings, autobandages, and autostructures. The term “chimeric antigen receptor” or “CAR” as used herein refers to an engineered molecule, which can be expressed by an immune cell including but not limited to T cells. CAR when expressed in T cells and can redirect T cells to induce killing of a target cell with a specificity dictated by the artificial receptor. The CAR's extracellular binding domain can be derived from a murine, humanized, or fully human monoclonal antibody. An “anti-GPC3-CAR” is a CAR that is capable of binding to GPC3. The term “epitope” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a part of an antigen that can be recognized by antibodies, B cells, T cells or engineered cells. For example, an epitope can be a cancer epitope that is recognized by a TCR. Multiple epitopes within an antigen can also be recognized. The epitope can also be mutated. The term “engineered” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to one or more alterations of a nucleic acid, e.g., the nucleic acid within an organism's genome. The term “engineered” can refer to alterations, additions, and/or deletion of genes. An engineered cell can also refer to a cell with an added, deleted and/or altered gene. The term “cell” or “engineered cell” and their grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a cell of human or non-human animal origin. An engineered cell can also refer to a CAR-expressing cell. The term “good manufacturing practices” (GMP) and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to products that are safe, effective, or pure according to the FDA. GMP can also sometimes be referred to as “cGMP”. The “c” stands for “current.” Manufacturers of a product can employ technologies and systems which are up-to-date in order to comply with regulation of GMP products. GMP compatible products are typically utilized in the clinical setting as opposed to the research setting. The term “transfection” as used herein refers to the introduction of foreign nucleic acid into eukaryotic cells. Transfection may be accomplished by a variety of means known to the art including calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, polybrene-mediated transfection, electroporation, microinjection, liposome fusion, lipofection, protoplast fusion, retroviral infection, and biolistics. The term “stable transfection” or “stably transfected” refers to the introduction and integration of foreign nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, into the genome of the transfected cell. The term “stable transfectant” refers to a cell which has stably integrated foreign DNA into the genomic DNA. As used herein, the terms “nucleic acid molecule encoding,” “DNA sequence encoding,” and “DNA encoding” refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The nucleic acid sequence thus codes for the amino acid sequence. The term “subject”, as used herein, refers to any animal, e.g., a mammal or marsupial. Subjects of the present invention include but are not limited to humans, non-human primates (e.g., rhesus or other types of macaques), mice, pigs, horses, donkeys, cows, sheep, rats and fowl of any kind. The term “recipient” and their grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a human or non-human animal in receipt of a therapy or treatment. The term “peripheral blood lymphocytes” (PBL) and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to lymphocytes that circulate in the blood (e.g., peripheral blood). Peripheral blood lymphocytes can refer to lymphocytes that are not localized to organs. Peripheral blood lymphocytes can comprise T cells, NK cells, B cell, or any combinations thereof. The term “immunoresponsive cell” can refer to a cell that can elicit an immune response, including but not limited to T cells, B cells, and NKT cells, their respective precursor cells and progeny thereof. An immunoresponsive cell can also refer to a cell of a lymphoid or myeloid lineage. The term “T cell” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a T cell from any origin. For example, a T cell can be a primary T cell, e.g., an autologous T cell, a cell line, etc. The T cell can also be human or non-human. The term “T cell activation” or “T cell triggering” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to the state of a T cell that has been sufficiently stimulated to induce detectable cellular proliferation, cytokine production and/or detectable effector function. In some cases, “full T cell activation” can be similar to triggering T cell cytotoxicity. T cell activation can be measured using various assays known in the art. Said assays can be an ELISA to measure cytokine secretion, an ELISPOT, flow cytometry assays to measure intracellular cytokine expression (CD107), flow cytometry assays to measure proliferation, and cytotoxicity assays (51Cr release assay) to determine target cell elimination. Said assays typically use controls (non-engineered cells) to compare to engineered cells (CAR T) to determine relative activation of an engineered cell compared to a control. Additionally, said assays can compare engineered cells incubated or put in contact with a target cell not expressing the target antigen. For example, said comparison can be a CD19-CAR T cell incubated with a target cell that does not express CD19. The term “sequence” and its grammatical equivalents when used to refer to a nucleotide sequence, can encompass DNA or RNA; and can be either single-stranded or double stranded. A nucleic acid sequence can be mutated. A nucleic acid sequence can be of any length, for example, between 2 and 1,000,000 or more nucleotides in length (or any integer value there between or there above), e.g., between about 100 and about 10,000 nucleotides or between about 200 and about 500 nucleotides. Methods of Use In one aspect, disclosed herein are methods of treating a subject exhibiting a solid tumor that expresses Glypican-3 (GPC3). A subject method typically comprises the step of administering anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor immunoresponsive cells to a subject, wherein the administering takes place after or concurrent with subjecting the subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment. Subjects treated by methods disclosed herein can exhibit a cancer or a solid tumor. Often, cancer cells or solid tumor cells express one or more tumor antigens. Typically, the tumor antigen is Glypican-3 (GPC3). A subject exhibiting a cancer or solid tumor expressing GPC-3 can be referred to as exhibiting a GPC3-positive cancer. Cancers that express GPC3 include but are not limited to liver cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, liposarcoma, testicular noneminomatous germ cell cancer, melanoma, adenoma, adrenal cancer, schwannoma, malignant, fibrous histiochytoma, or any combination thereof. The subject methods are applicable for treating squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma of a GI tract, or any other cancer disclosed in “Glypican-3 expression in gastrointestinal and pancreatic epithelial neoplasms. (2013) 44, 542-550 Human Pathology.” Additionally immunoresponsive cells disclosed herein, such as an anti-GPC3-CAR-T disclosed herein, can be utilized to target ovarian carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, mesothelioma, breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the lunch, cervical intraethithelial neoplasia, squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, oncocytoma, papillary carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, papillary carcinoma, and lobular and medullary carcinoma of the breast. Additional targets for anti-GPC3 therapy can include those found in, “Glypican 3 expression in human nonneoplastic, preneoplastic, and neoplastic tissues. (2008) 129:899-906 Am J ClinPathol.” In some cases, a cancer or tumor cell can be evaluated for GPC3 expression by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. A level of GPC3 on a cancer or tumor cell can be classified as low, medium, or high. In some cases, a cancer or tumor cell can express GPC3 on the cell surface. Expression of GPC3 on a cell surface can be determined, for example, using antibodies to GPC3 in a method such as immunohistochemistry or flow cytometric analysis. Alternatively, GPC3 mRNA expression can be considered to correlate to GPC3 expression on a cell surface and can be determined by a method selected from in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. In some cases, GPC3 is encoded by a gene comprising the nucleic acid sequence exhibiting at least 50% sequence identity to the referenced gene in Table 2. GPC3 can be encoded by a gene comprising the nucleic acid sequence exhibiting at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% sequence identity to the referenced gene in Table 2. In some embodiments, anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor immunoresponsive cells are administered to a subject exhibiting a solid tumor expressing GPC3 after or concurrent with subjecting the subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment. A subject anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) typically comprises an extracellular antigen binding region, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling region that controls immunoresponsive cell activation. In some cases, the anti-GPC3 CAR further comprises a hinge or spacer. In some cases, the anti-GPC3 CAR further comprises one or more co-stimulatory domains. A chimeric antigen receptor typically comprises an extracellular antigen binding region. In one embodiment, the extracellular antigen binding region can be fully human. In other cases, the extracellular antigen binding region can be humanized. In other cases, the extracellular antigen binding region can be murine or a chimeric in the extracellular antigen binding region is composed of amino acid sequences derived from at least two different animal species. In some cases, the extracellular antigen binding region can be non-human. A variety of antigen binding regions can be designed to target GPC3. Non-limiting examples include single-chain variable fragments (scFv's) derived from antibodies, fragment antigen binding region (Fab) selected from libraries, single domain fragment, or nature ligands that engage their cognate receptor. An extracellular antigen binding region can encompass a scFv, a Fab, or a nature ligand, as well as any of their derivatives. An extracellular antigen binding region can refer to a molecule other than an intact antibody that can comprise a portion of an intact antibody and that can bind an antigen to which an intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments can include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab′, Fab′-SH, F (ab′) 2; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g. scFv); and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. An extracellular antigen binding region, for example the scFv, Fab, or natural ligand, can be a portion of a CAR that determines antigen specificity. An extracellular antigen binding region can bind to any complementary target. An extracellular antigen binding region can be derived from an antibody for which sequences of a variable region are known. An extracellular antigen binding region can be derived from an antibody sequence obtained from an available mouse hybridoma. Alternatively, an extracellular antigen binding region can be obtained from whole-exomic sequencing of a tumor cell or primary cell, such as a tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL). In some cases, binding specificity of an extracellular antigen binding region can be determined by complementarity determining regions, or CDRs, such as light chain CDRs or heavy chain CDRs. In many cases, binding specificity can be determined by light chain CDRs and heavy chain CDRs. A given combination of heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDRs can provide a given binding pocket that can confer a greater affinity and/or specificity towards an antigen, such as GPC3, as compared to other reference antigens. For example, a CDR specific to glypican-3 can be expressed in an extracellular binding region of a CAR such that the CAR targeting the GPC3 can target the immunoresponsive cell to a tumor cell expressing GPC3. In some aspects of any of the embodiments disclosed herein, an extracellular antigen binding region, such as a scFv, can comprise a light chain CDR specific for GPC3. A light chain CDR can be a complementarity determining region of a light chain of an antigen binding unit, such as a scFv of a CAR. A light chain CDR can comprise a continuous sequence of amino acid residues, or two or more contiguous sequences of amino acid residues separated by, and optionally flanked by, non-complementarity determining regions, such as framework regions. In some cases, a light chain CDR can comprise two or more light chain CDRs, which can be referred to as light chain CDR-1, CDR-2, and so on. In some cases, a light chain CDR can comprise three light chain CDRs, which can be referred to as light chain CDR-1, light chain CDR-2, and light chain CDR-3 respectively. In some examples, a group of CDRs present on a common light chain can collectively be referred to as light chain CDRs. In some aspects of any of the embodiments disclosed herein, extracellular antigen binding region, such as a scFv, can comprise a heavy chain CDR specific for GPC3. A heavy chain CDR can be a complementarity determining region of a heavy chain of an antigen binding unit such as a scFv. A heavy chain CDR can comprise a continuous sequence of amino acid residues, or two or more contiguous sequences of amino acid residues separated by, and optionally flanked by, non-complementarity determining regions, such as framework regions. In some cases, a heavy chain CDR can comprise two or more heavy chain CDRs, which can be referred to as heavy chain CDR-1, CDR-2, and so on. In some cases, a heavy chain CDR can comprise three heavy chain CDRs, which can be referred to as heavy chain CDR-1, heavy chain CDR-2, and heavy chain CDR-3 respectively. In some cases, a group of CDRs present on a common heavy chain can collectively be referred to as heavy chain CDRs. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region targeting GPC3 can be expressed by an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell. In some cases, CDRs, light chain and/or heavy chain that bind a GPC3 antigen can be comprised within an extracellular antigen binding region of a CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as CAR T cells. In some cases, modified anti-GPC3 CDRs can be expressed on an extracellular antigen binding region of a CAR immunoresponsive cell and have from about 50% homology to about 100% homology to original anti-GPC3 CDRs. In some cases, a modified anti-GPC3 CDR can comprise from about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% homology to an unmodified anti-GPC3 CDR. In some cases, a scFv targeting GPC3 can be expressed by an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell. In some cases, CDRs, light chain and/or heavy chain that bind a GPC3 antigen can be expressed on a scFv of a CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as CAR T cells. In some cases, modified anti-GPC3 CDRs can be expressed on a scFv of a CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as CAR T cells, and have from about 50% homology to about 100% homology to original anti-GPC3 CDRs. In some cases, a modified anti-GPC3 CDR can comprise from about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% homology to an unmodified anti-GPC3 CDR. \n",

      " In preferred cases, an extracellular antigen binding region specifically recognizes GPC3. GPC3 can comprise a sequence exhibition at least 80% identical to a referenced GPC3 gene in Table 2. In some cases, extracellular antigen binding region can target an N-terminus, a C-terminus, or any portion from an N-terminus to a C-terminus of GPC3. A C-terminus of a GPC3 can be attached to a cell membrane covalently via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. A C-terminus can comprise from about 1 to about 800 bases in some cases.

      " By employing genetic engineering, an extracellular antigen binding region may be modified in a variety of ways. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region can be mutated, so that the extracellular antigen binding region may be selected for higher affinity to its target. In some cases, the affinity of the extracellular antigen binding region for its target can be optimized for targets that can be expressed at low levels on normal tissues. This optimization can be performed to minimize potential toxicities. In other cases, the cloning of an extracellular antigen binding region that has a higher affinity for the membrane bound form of a target can be preferable over its soluble form counterpart. This modification can be performed because some targets can also be detected in soluble form at different levels and their targeting can cause unintended toxicity. In some cases, a extracellular antigen binding region can be from about 50% to about 100% similar in homology to any one of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, or SEQ ID NO: 8. In some cases, a extracellular antigen binding region can comprise about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% homology to SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, or SEQ ID NO: 8. In some cases, extracellular antigen binding region can be murine, humanized, or fully human. An extracellular antigen binding region can be from about 1% to about 100% human. In some cases, a extracellular antigen binding region can be from about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or up to about 100% human. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region comprises a hinge or spacer. The terms hinge and spacer can be used interchangeably. A hinge can be considered a portion of a CAR used to provide flexibility to an extracellular antigen binding region. In some cases, a hinge can be used to detect a CAR on the cell surface of a cell, particularly when antibodies to detect the extracellular antigen binding region are not functional or available. For instance the length of the hinge derived from an immunoglobulin may require optimization depending on the location of the epitope on the target that the extracellular antigen binding region is targeting. In some cases, a hinge may not belong to an immunoglobulin but instead to another molecule such the native hinge of a CD8 alpha molecule. A CD8 alpha hinge can contain cysteine and proline residues known to play a role in the interaction of a CD8 co-receptor and MHC molecule. Said cysteine and proline residues can influence the performance of said CAR. A CAR hinge can be size tunable and can compensate to some extent in normalizing the orthogonal synapse distance between CAR immunoresponsive cell and a target cell. This topography of the immunological synapse between an immunoresponsive cell and a target cell also defines a distance that cannot be functionally bridged by a CAR due to a membrane-distal epitope on a cell-surface target molecule that, even with a short hinge CAR, cannot bring the synapse distance in to an approximation for signaling. Likewise, membrane-proximal CAR target antigen epitopes have been described for which signaling outputs are only observed in the context of a long hinge CAR. A hinge can be tuned according to the extracellular antigen binding region that is used. A hinge can be of any length. A transmembrane domain can anchor a CAR to the plasma membrane of a cell. A native transmembrane portion of CD28 can be used in a CAR. In other cases, a native transmembrane portion of CD8 alpha can also be used in the CAR. By “CD8” it can be meant a protein having at least 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identity to NCBI Reference No: NP_001759 or a fragment thereof that has stimulatory activity. By “CD8 nucleic acid molecule” it can be meant a polynucleotide encoding a CD8 polypeptide. In some cases, a transmembrane region can be a native transmembrane portion of CD28. By “CD28” it can be meant a protein having at least 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identity to NCBI Reference No: NP_006130 or a fragment thereof that has stimulatory activity. By “CD28 nucleic acid molecule” can be meant a polynucleotide encoding a CD28 polypeptide. In some cases, the transmembrane portion can comprise CD8a region. An intracellular signaling region of a CAR can be responsible for activation of at least one of an effector function of the immunoresponsive cell in which the CAR has been placed in. A CAR can induce the effector function of a T cell, for example, which may be cytolytic activity or helper activity including the secretion of cytokines. Thus the term intracellular signaling region refers to the portion of a protein which transduces the effector function signal and directs the cell to perform a specialized function. While usually the entire intracellular signaling region can be employed, in many cases it is not necessary to use the entire chain of a signaling domain. In some cases, a truncated portion of the intracellular signaling region is used. In some cases, the term intracellular signaling region is thus meant to include any truncated portion of the intracellular signaling region sufficient to transduce the effector function signal. Preferred examples of signaling domains for use in a CAR can include a cytoplasmic sequence of the T cell receptor (TCR) and co-receptors that act in concert to initiate signal transduction following target-receptor engagement, as well as any derivative or variant of these sequences and any synthetic sequence that has the same functional capability. In some cases, said intracellular signaling region may contain signaling motifs which are known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Examples of ITAM containing cytoplasmic signaling sequences include those derived from TCR zeta, FcR gamma, FcR beta, CD3 gamma, CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon, CD5, CD22, CD79a, CD79b, and CD66d. However, in preferred embodiments, the intracellular signaling domain is derived from CD3 zeta chain. An example of a T cell signaling domain containing one or more ITAM motifs is the CD3 zeta domain, also known as T-cell receptor T3 zeta chain or CD247. This domain is part of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex and plays an important role in coupling antigen recognition to several intracellular signal-transduction pathways with primary effector activation of the T cell. As used herein, CD3 zeta is primarily directed to human CD3 zeta and its isoforms as known from Swissprot entry P20963, including proteins having a substantially identical sequence. As part of the chimeric antigen receptor, again the full T cell receptor T3 zeta chain is not required and any derivatives thereof comprising the signaling domain of T-cell receptor T3 zeta chain are suitable, including any functional equivalents thereof. An intracellular signaling domain can be selected from any one of the domains of Table 3. In some cases, a domain may be modified so that homology to any one of the refereneced domains may from about 50% to about 100%. Any one of the domains of Table 3 may be modified such that a modified version may comprise from about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or up to about 100% homology. An intracellular signaling region of a CAR can further comprise one or more costimulatory domains. An intracellular signaling region can comprise a single co-stimulatory domain, for example a zeta-chain (1st generation CAR), or CD28 or 4-1BB (2nd generation CAR). In other examples, an intracellular signaling region can comprise two co-stimulatory domains, such as CD28/OX40 or CD28/4-1BB (3rd generation). Together with intracellular signaling domains such as CD8, these co-stimulatory domains can produce downstream activation of kinase pathways, which support gene transcription and functional cellular responses. Co-stimulatory domains of CARs can activate proximal signaling proteins related to either CD28 (Phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase) or 4-1BB/OX40 (TNF-receptor-associated-factor adapter proteins) pathways, and MAPK and Akt activation. In some cases, signals generated through the CAR can be complexed with secondary or co-stimulatory signals. With respect to the co-stimulatory signaling domain, the chimeric antigen receptor like complex can be designed to comprise several possible co-stimulatory signaling domains. As is well known in the art, in naïve T-cells the mere engagement of the T-cell receptor is not sufficient to induce full activation of T-cells into cytotoxic T-cells. Full, productive T cell activation requires a second co-stimulatory signal. Several receptors that have been reported to provide co-stimulation for T-cell activation, include, but are not limited to CD28, OX40, CD27, CD2, CD5, ICAM-1, LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), 4-1BBL, MyD88 and 4-1BB. The signaling pathways utilized by these co-stimulatory molecules share the common property of acting in synergy with the primary T cell receptor activation signal. These co-stimulatory signaling regions provide a signal that can be synergistic with the primary effector activation signal originating from one or more ITAM motifs, for example a CD3 zeta signaling domain, and can complete the requirements for activation of the T cell. In some cases, addition of co-stimulatory domains to a chimeric antigen receptor-like complex can enhance efficacy and durability of engineered cells. In another embodiment the T cell signaling domain and the co-stimulatory domain are fused to one another thereby composing the signaling region. \n",

      " In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR can have at least one or more of the following characteristics, in any combination: a) binds to recombinant human GPC3; b) binds to recombinant cynomolgus monkey GPC3; c) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of HepG2 cells; d) binds to cynomolgus monkey GPC3 expressed on the surface of 293 cells; e) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of a cancer cell; f) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of hepatocellular carcinoma cell; g) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of cells of a cell line selected from HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, and JHH-7; h) binds to an epitope within amino acids 25 to 137 of human GPC3; i) binds to an epitope spanning the furin cleavage site at amino acids R358/S359 of human GPC3; j) binds to full-length mature human GPC3, but does not bind to an N-terminal fragment of human GPC3 or to a C-terminal fragment of human GPC3 k) binds to an epitope within amino acids 420 to 470 of human GPC3; 1) binds to an epitope within amino acids 470 to 509 of human GPC3; m) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 7H1; n) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 4G7; o) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 15G1; binds a C-terminal fragment of human GPC3; and/or p) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 4A11. A transgene encoding a subject anti-GPC3 CAR can be incorporated into a cell. For example, a transgene can be incorporated into an immunoresponsive cell, such as a T cell. When inserted into a cell, a transgene can be either a complementary DNA (cDNA) segment, which is a copy of messenger RNA (mRNA), or a gene itself residing in its original region of genomic DNA (with or without introns). A nucleic acid, e.g., DNA, encoding a transgene sequence can be randomly inserted into a chromosome of a cell. A random integration can result from any method of introducing a nucleic acid, e.g., DNA, into a cell. For example, the method can be, but is not limited to, electroporation, sonoporation, use of a gene gun, lipotransfection, calcium phosphate transfection, use of dendrimers, microinjection, and use of viral vectors including adenoviral, AAV, and retroviral vectors, and/or group II ribozymes. A DNA encoding a transgene can be introduced into a cell via electroporation. A DNA can also be introduced into a cell via lipofection, infection, or transformation. Electroporation and/or lipofection can be used to transfect primary cells. Electroporation and/or lipofection can be used to transfect primary hematopoietic cells. A DNA can also be introduced into a cell genome without the use of homologous recombination. In some cases, a DNA can be flanked by engineered sites that are complementary to the targeted double strand break region in a genome. In some cases, a DNA can be excised from a polynucleic acid so it can be inserted at a double strand break region without homologous recombination. A transgene to be inserted can be flanked by engineered sites analogous to a targeted double strand break site in the genome to excise the transgene from a polynucleic acid so it can be inserted at the double strand break region. A DNA encoding a transgene can also be designed to include a reporter gene so that the presence of a transgene or its expression product can be detected via activation of the reporter gene. Any reporter gene can be used, such as those disclosed above. By selecting in cell culture those cells in which a reporter gene has been activated, cells can be selected that contain a transgene. Expression of a CAR can be verified by an expression assay, for example, qPCR or by measuring levels of RNA. Expression level can be indicative also of copy number. For example, if expression levels are extremely high, this can indicate that more than one copy of a CAR was integrated in a genome. Alternatively, high expression can indicate that a transgene was integrated in a highly transcribed area, for example, near a highly expressed promoter. Expression can also be verified by measuring protein levels, such as through Western blotting. A subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can comprise one or more transgenes. One or more transgenes can express a CAR protein recognizing and binding to at least one epitope (e.g., GPC3) on an antigen or bind to a mutated epitope on an antigen. A CAR can be a functional CAR. A subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can also comprise one or more CARs, or it can comprise a single CAR and a secondary engineered receptor. A transgene can encode for a suicide gene. As evidenced in many effective treatments in cancer patients, objective tumor regressions in response to CAR immunoresponsive cells can be accompanied by toxicities. In some cases, a CAR immunoresponsive cell may be unable to distinguish between tumor and normal tissues when the targeted antigen is shared between them (“on-target/off-tumor” toxicity). In other cases, systemic perturbation of the immune system, known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), can occur. Said CRS can comprise systemic inflammatory response syndrome or cytokine storm, which can be consequences of the rapid in vivo expansion of CAR immunoresponsive cells. CRS is a condition characterized by fever and hypotension that, in severe cases, can lead to multiple organ failure. In most cases, said toxicity correlates with the in vivo expansion of infused CAR immunoresponsive cells, which can cause a general perturbation of the immune system, and release of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF alpha and IL-6. In some cases, CAR immunoresponsive cells targeting antigens shared with normal tissues can be generated such that they transiently express the CAR, for example after electroporation of mRNA encoding the receptor. In addition, there are significant efforts to further engineer CAR immunoresponsive cells by including safety switches that can allow the drastic elimination of CAR immunoresponsive cells in case of severe on-target toxicity. Vectors encoding a CAR can be combined with safety switches, such as the inducible caspase-9 gene (activated by a chemical inducer of dimerization) or a truncated form of the EGF receptor R (activated by the monoclonal antibody cetuximab) or RQR8. A subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can encode a suicide gene transgene. Said transgene can also comprise a CAR receptor or another similar receptor. A suicide gene can induce elimination of CAR immunoresponsive cells. A suicide gene can be any gene that induces apoptosis in said CAR immunoresponsive cell. A suicide gene can be encoded within a viral vector along with an anti-GPC3 CAR. One or more transgenes can be from different species. For example, one or more transgenes can comprise a human gene, a mouse gene, a rat gene, a pig gene, a bovine gene, a dog gene, a cat gene, a monkey gene, a chimpanzee gene, or any combination thereof. For example, a transgene can be from a human, having a human genetic sequence. One or more transgenes can comprise human genes. In some cases, one or more transgenes are not adenoviral genes. A transgene can be inserted into a genome of an immunoresponsive cell in a random or site-specific manner, as described above. For example, a transgene can be inserted to a random locus in a genome of an immunoresponsive cell. These transgenes can be functional, e.g., fully functional if inserted anywhere in a genome. For instance, a transgene can encode its own promoter or can be inserted into a position where it is under the control of an endogenous promoter. Alternatively, a transgene can be inserted into a gene, such as an intron of a gene or an exon of a gene, a promoter, or a non-coding region. A transgene can be inserted such that the insertion disrupts a gene, e.g., an endogenous immune checkpoint. Sometimes, more than one copy of a transgene can be inserted into more than a random locus in a genome. For example, multiple copies can be inserted into a random locus in a genome. This can lead to increased overall expression than if a transgene was randomly inserted once. Alternatively, a copy of a transgene can be inserted into a gene, and another copy of a transgene can be inserted into a different gene. A transgene can be targeted so that it could be inserted to a specific locus in a genome of a immunoresponsive cell. In some cases, a polynucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding a subject anti-GPC3 CAR, can take the form of a plasmid vector. A plasmid vector can comprise a promoter. In some cases, a promotor can be constitutive. In some cases, a promoter can be inducible. A promoter can be or can be derived from CMV, U6, MND, or EF1a. In some cases, a promoter can be adjacent to a CAR sequence. In some cases, a plasmid vector further comprises a splicing acceptor. In some cases, a splicing acceptor can be adjacent to a CAR sequence. A promoter sequence can be a PKG or an MND promoter. An MND promoter can be a synthetic promoter that contains a U3 region of a modified MoMuLV LTR with a myeloproliferative sarcoma virus enhancer. In some cases, a polynucleic acid, encoding a subject anti-GPC3 CAR, can be designed to be delivered to a cell by non-viral techniques. In some cases, a polynucleic acid can be a good manufacturing practices (GMP) compatible reagent. Expression of a polynucleic acid encoding for a subject anti-GPC3 CAR can be controlled by one or more promoters. A promoter can be a ubiquitous, constitutive (unregulated promoter that allows for continual transcription of an associated gene), tissue-specific promoter or an inducible promoter. Expression of a transgene that is inserted adjacent to or near a promoter can be regulated. For example, a transgene can be inserted near or next to a ubiquitous promoter. Some ubiquitous promoters can be a CAGGS promoter, an hCMV promoter, a PGK promoter, an SV40 promoter, or a ROSA26 promoter. A promoter can be endogenous or exogenous. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to an endogenous or exogenous ROSA26 promoter. Further, a promoter can be specific to an immunoresponsive cell. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to a porcine ROSA26 promoter. Tissue specific promoter or cell-specific promoters can be used to control the location of expression. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to a tissue-specific promoter. Tissue-specific promoters can be a FABP promoter, an Lck promoter, a CamKII promoter, a CD19 promoter, a Keratin promoter, an Albumin promoter, an aP2 promoter, an insulin promoter, an MCK promoter, a MyHC promoter, a WAP promoter, or a Col2A promoter. Tissue specific promoter or cell-specific promoters can be used to control the location of expression. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to a tissue-specific promoter. Tissue-specific promoters can be a FABP promoter, an Lck promoter, a CamKII promoter, a CD19 promoter, a Keratin promoter, an Albumin promoter, an aP2 promoter, an insulin promoter, an MCK promoter, a MyHC promoter, a WAP promoter, or a Col2A promoter. Inducible promoters can be used as well. These inducible promoters can be turned on and off when desired, by adding or removing an inducing agent. It is contemplated that an inducible promoter can be, but is not limited to, a Lac, tac, trc, trp, araBAD, phoA, recA, proU, cst-1, tetA, cadA, nar, PL, cspA, T7, VHB, Mx, and/or Trex. Furthermore, although not required for expression, transgene sequence may also include transcriptional or translational regulatory sequences, for example, promoters, enhancers, insulators, internal ribosome entry sites, sequences encoding 2A peptides and/or polyadenylation signals. In some instances, a transgene encodes a subject anti-GPC3 CAR wherein the transgene is inserted into a safe harbor such that an anti-GPC3 CAR is expressed. In some instances, the transgene is inserted into a PD1 and/or a CTLA-4 locus. In other cases, a transgene is delivered to the cell in a lentivirus for random insertion while the PD1- or CTLA-4 specific nucleases can be supplied as mRNAs. In some instances, the transgene is delivered via a viral vector system such as a retrovirus, AAV or adenovirus along with mRNA encoding nucleases specific for a safe harbor (e.g. AAVS1, CCR5, albumin or HPRT). The cells can also be treated with mRNAs encoding PD1 and/or CTLA-4 specific nucleases. In some cases, the polynucleotide encoding a CAR is supplied via a viral delivery system together with mRNA encoding HPRT specific nucleases and PD 1- or CTLA-4 specific nucleases. CARs that can be used with the methods and compositions disclosed herein can include all types of these chimeric proteins, including first, second and third generation designs. Other agents such as CCR2 or siRNA can be applied to reduce PD-1 expression. In some cases, a retroviral vector (either gamma-retroviral or lentiviral) can be employed for the introduction of the transgene into an immunoresponsive cell. For example, a transgene encoding a CAR (e.g., anti-GPC3 CAR), or any receptor that binds a GPC3 antigen, or a variant, or a fragment thereof, can be cloned into a retroviral vector and expression can be driven from its endogenous promoter, from the retroviral long terminal repeat, or from a promoter specific for a target cell type of interest. Non-viral vectors may be used as well. Non-viral vector delivery systems can include DNA plasmids, naked nucleic acid, and nucleic acid complexed with a delivery vehicle such as a liposome or poloxamer. A number of viral based systems have been developed for gene transfer into mammalian cells. For example, retroviruses provide a convenient platform for gene delivery systems. A selected gene can be inserted into a vector and packaged in retroviral particles using techniques known in the art. Vectors derived from retroviruses such as the lentivirus are suitable tools to achieve long-term gene transfer since they allow long-term, stable integration of a transgene and its propagation in daughter cells. Lentiviral vectors have the added advantage over vectors derived from onco-retroviruses such as murine leukemia viruses in that they can transduce non-proliferating cells. They also have the added advantage of low immunogenicity. Adenoviral vectors have the advantage that they do not integrate into the genome of the target cell thereby bypassing negative integration-related events. A cell can be transfected with a transgene encoding a CAR. A transgene concentration can be from about 100 picograms to about 50 micrograms. In some cases, the amount of nucleic acid (e.g., ssDNA, dsDNA, RNA) that may be introduced into a cell may be varied to optimize transfection efficiency and/or cell viability. For example, 1 microgram of dsDNA may be added to each cell sample for electroporation. In some cases, the amount of nucleic acid (e.g., dsDNA) required for optimal transfection efficiency and/or cell viability may be specific to the cell type. In some cases, the amount of nucleic acid (e.g., dsDNA) used for each sample may directly correspond to the transfection efficiency and/or cell viability. For example, a range of concentrations of transfections. A transgene encoded by a vector can integrate into a cellular genome. In some cases, integration of a transgene encoded by a vector is in the forward direction. In other cases, integration of a transgene encoded by a vector is in the reverse direction. In some cases, the starting cell density for cellular modification, such as viral delivery of a CAR, may be varied to optimize transfection efficiency and/or cell viability. In some cases, the starting cell density for transfection or transduction of cells with a viral vector may be less than about 1×105 cells. In some cases, the starting cell density for cellular modification with a viral vector may be at least about 1×105 cells to at least about 5×107 cells. In some cases, the starting cell density for optimal transfection efficiency and/or cell viability may be specific to the cell type. For example, a starting cell density of 1.5×106 cells may optimal (e.g., provide the highest viability and/or transfection efficiency) for macrophage cells. In another example, a starting cell density of 5×106 cells may optimal (e.g., provide the highest viability and/or transfection efficiency) for human cells. In some cases, a range of starting cell densities may be optimal for a given cell type. For example, a starting cell density between of 5.6×106 and 5×107 cells may optimal (e.g., provide the highest viability and/or transfection efficiency) for human cells such as T cells. The efficiency of integration of a nucleic acid sequence encoding CAR into a genome of a cell with, for example, a viral system, can be or can be about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, or more than 99.9%. In some cases, detection of a CAR on a cellular membrane of an engineered cell can be or can be about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, or more than 99.9% as measured by flow cytometry. In some cases, the immunoresponsive cell can be a stem memory TSCM cell comprised of CD45RO (−), CCR7(+), CD45RA (+), CD62L+(L-selectin), CD27+, CD28+ and/or IL-7Rα+, said stem memory cells can also express CD95, IL-2Rβ, CXCR3, and/or LFA-1, and show numerous functional attributes distinctive of said stem memory cells. Alternatively, the immunoresponsive cell can also be central memory TCM cells comprising L-selectin and CCR7, where the central memory cells can secrete, for example, IL-2, but not IFNγ or IL-4. The immunoresponsive cells can also be effector memory TEM cells comprising L-selectin or CCR7 and produce, for example, effector cytokines such as IFNγ and IL-4. Vectors can be delivered in vivo by administration to an individual patient, typically by systemic administration (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subdermal, or intracranial infusion) or topical application, as described below. Alternatively, vectors can be delivered to cells ex vivo, such as cells explanted from an individual patient (e.g., lymphocytes, T cells, bone marrow aspirates, tissue biopsy), followed by reimplantation of the cells into a patient, usually after selection for cells which have incorporated the vector. Prior to or after selection, the cells can be expanded. A suitable immunoresponsive cell for expressing anti-GPC3-CAR can be a cell that may be autologous or non-autologous to a subject in need thereof. A source of suitable immunoresponsive cells can be obtained from a subject. In some cases T cells can be obtained. Said T cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including PBMCs, bone marrow, lymph node tissue, cord blood, thymus tissue, and tissue from a site of infection, ascites, pleural effusion, spleen tissue, and tumors. In certain cases, T cells can be obtained from a unit of blood collected from a subject using any number of techniques known to the skilled artisan, such as Ficoll™ separation. In one embodiment, cells from the circulating blood of an individual are obtained by apheresis. The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. In one embodiment, the cells collected by apheresis may be washed to remove the plasma fraction and to place the cells in an appropriate buffer or media for subsequent processing steps. Alternatively, a cell can be derived from a healthy donor, from a patient diagnosed with cancer, or from a patient diagnosed with an infection. In another embodiment, a cell can be part of a mixed population of cells which present different phenotypic characteristics. A cell line can also be obtained from a transformed T cell according to the method previously described. A cell can also be obtained from a cell therapy bank. Modified cells resistant to an immunosuppressive treatment can be obtained by any of the method described herein. A desirable cell population can also be selected prior to modification. An engineered cell population can also be selected after modification. An engineered cell can be used in autologous transplantation. Alternatively, a cell can be used in allogeneic transplantation. In some instances, a cell is administered to the same patient whose sample was used to identify the cancer-related target sequence. In other instances, a cell is administered to a patient different from the patient whose sample was used to identify the cancer-related target sequence. In some cases, an immune responsive cell can be a primary cell including primary T cell, a stem cell, or a progenitor cell. A progenitor cell can be a hematopoietic progenitor cell. A cell of the present invention can be a human cell. Suitable cells can be expanded ex vivo. A suitable cell can also be CD45RO(−), CCR7(+), CD45RA(+), CD62L(+), CD27(+), CD28(+), IL-7Ra(+), or combinations thereof. In some cases, suitable primary cells include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and other blood cell subsets such as, but not limited to, T cell, a natural killer cell, a monocyte, a natural killer T cell, a monocyte-precursor cell, a hematopoietic stem cell or a non-pluripotent stem cell. In some cases, the cell can be any immune cells including any T-cell such as tumor infiltrating cells (TILs), such as CD3+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, or any other type of T-cell. The T cell can also include memory T cells, memory stem T cells, or effector T cells. The T cells can also be selected from a bulk population, for example, selecting T cells from whole blood. The T cells can also be expanded from a bulk population. The T cells can also be skewed towards particular populations and phenotypes. For example, the T cells can be skewed to phenotypically comprise, CD45RO (−), CCR7 (+), CD45RA (+), CD62L (+), CD27 (+), CD28 (+) and/or IL-7Ra (+). Suitable cells can be selected that comprise one of more markers selected from a list comprising: CD45RO (−), CCR7 (+), CD45RA (+), CD62L (+), CD27 (+), CD28 (+) and/or IL-7Rα (+). Suitable cells also include stem cells such as, by way of example, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, neuronal stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells. Suitable cells can comprise any number of primary cells, such as human cells, non-human cells, and/or mouse cells. Suitable cells can be progenitor cells. Suitable cells can be derived from the subject to be treated (e.g., patient). Suitable cells can be derived from a human donor. Suitable cells can be stem memory TSCM cells comprised of CD45RO (−), CCR7(+), CD45RA (+), CD62L+(L-selectin), CD27+, CD28+ and IL-7Rα+, said stem memory cells can also express CD95, IL-2Rβ, CXCR3, and LFA-1, and show numerous functional attributes distinctive of said stem memory cells. Suitable cells can be central memory TCM cells comprising L-selectin and CCR7, said central memory cells can secrete, for example, IL-2, but not IFNγ or IL-4. Suitable cells can also be effector memory TEM cells comprising L-selectin or CCR7 and produce, for example, effector cytokines such as IFNγ and IL-4. In some cases, a method can include enriching cultured T cells for CD8+ T cells prior to rapid expansion of cells. Following culture of T cells in IL-2, the T cells can be depleted of CD4+ cells and enriched for CD8+ cells using, for example, a CD8 microbead separation (e.g., using a CliniMACSplus CD8 microbead system (Miltenyi Biotec)). Without being bound to a particular theory, it can be believed that CD4+, CD25+ regulatory T-cells can impede anti-tumor responses. Accordingly, it can be believed that enriching cultured T cells for CD8+ T cells and reducing or eliminating CD4+ cells may improve the impact of adoptively transferred anti-tumor CD8+ cells, improve the response rates in patients, and/or reduce the toxicities seen by production of cytokines by CD4+ cells. Additionally, enriched CD8+ “young” T cells can be believed to behave more reliably and predictably in clinical scale rapid expansions than the bulk T cells. A cell can be a good manufacturing practices (GMP) compatible reagent. A cell can be part of a combination therapy to treat cancer, infections, autoimmune disorders, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a subject in need thereof. In some cases, a cell of the present invention can be administered of a subject in need thereof as a monotherapy. In some cases, cells expressing a subject CAR include heterogeneous T cell populations. In some cases, cells used can be largely composed of a heterogeneous proportion of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Said CD4 and CD8 cells can have phenotypic characteristics of circulating effector T cells. Said CD4 and CD8 cells can also have a phenotypic characteristic of effector-memory cells. In another embodiment, cells can be central-memory cells. Suitable cells that can be isolated from a donor can be at any stage of development including, but not limited to, fetal, neonatal, young and adult. For example, donor immunoresponsive cells can be isolated from adult human Donor human immunoresponsive cells can be under the age of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 year(s). For example, immunoresponsive cells can be isolated from a human under the age of 6 years Immunoresponsive cells can also be isolated from a human under the age of 3 years. A donor can be older than 10 years. A method of attaining suitable cells can comprise selecting based on a given marker. For example, such marker can comprise GFP, a resistance gene, a cell surface marker, or an endogenous tag. Cells can be selected using any endogenous marker. Applicable cell selection techniques include flow cytometry and/or magnetic columns. Selected cells can subsequently be infused into a subject. Selected cells can also be expanded to large numbers. Selected cells can be expanded prior to infusion. The amount of cells that are necessary to be therapeutically effective in a patient may vary depending on the viability of the cells, and the efficiency with which the cells have been genetically modified (e.g., the efficiency with which a transgene has been integrated into one or more cells, or a level of expression of a protein encoded by the transgene). In some cases, the product (e.g., multiplication) of the viability of cells post genetic modification and the efficiency of integration of a transgene may correspond to the therapeutic aliquot of cells available for administration to a subject. In some cases, an increase in the viability of cells post genetic modification may correspond to a decrease in the amount of cells that are necessary for administration to be therapeutically effective in a patient. In some cases, an increase in the efficiency with which a transgene has been integrated into one or more cells may correspond to a decrease in the amount of cells that are necessary for administration to be therapeutically effective in a patient. In some cases, determining an amount of cells that are necessary to be therapeutically effective may comprise determining a function corresponding to a change in the viability of cells over time. In some cases, determining an amount of cells that are necessary to be therapeutically effective may comprise determining a function corresponding to a change in the efficiency with which a transgene may be integrated into one or more cells with respect to time dependent variables (e.g., cell culture time, electroporation time, cell stimulation time). In some cases, therapeutically effective cells can be a population of cells that comprise from about 30% to about 100% expression of an anti-GPC3 CAR on a cellular surface. In some cases, therapeutically effective cells can express an anti-GPC3 CAR on a cellular surface from about 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, to more than about 99.9% as measured by flow cytometry. A variety of cells can be used to express the subject CAR, as described above. Anti-GPC3 CAR can be present in the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell, e.g., a mammalian cell, where suitable mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, a cytotoxic cell, a T lymphocyte, a stem cell, a progeny of a stem cell, a progenitor cell, a progeny of a progenitor cell, and an NK cell. When present in the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell, a CAR can be active in the presence of its binding target. For example, an anti-GPC3 CAR can be active in the presence of GPC3. A target, such as GPC3, can be expressed on a membrane. A target can also be soluble (e.g., not bound to a cell). A target can be present on the surface of a cell such as a target cell. A target can be presented on a solid surface such as a lipid bilayer; and the like. A target can be soluble, such as a soluble antigen. A target can be an antigen. An antigen can be present on the surface of a cell such as a target cell. An antigen can be presented on a solid surface such as a lipid bilayer; and the like. In some cases, a target can be an epitope of an antigen. In methods disclosed herein, the antigen is typically GPC3 and the GPC3 expressing target cell is a cancer or tumor cell. In some instances, a CAR, when present on the plasma membrane of a cell, and when activated by binding its target, can result in cytotoxic activity by the cell toward a target that expresses on its cell surface an antigen to which the binding domain of the CAR binds. For example, in some cases a cell can be a cytotoxic cell (e.g., an NK cell or a cytotoxic T lymphocyte), a CAR of the present disclosure, when present in the plasma membrane of a cell, and when activated by binding its target, can increase cytotoxic activity of a cytotoxic cell toward a target cell that expresses on its cell surface an antigen to which the binding domain of a CAR binds. For example, in some cases a cell can be an NK cell or a T lymphocyte, a CAR of the present disclosure, when present in the plasma membrane of a cell, and when activated by binding of its target, can increase cytotoxic activity of a cell by at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 2-fold, at least 2.5-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, or more 10-fold, compared to the cytotoxic activity of the cell in the absence of the binding target. In some cases, a CAR, when activated by binding its target, can result in other CAR activation related events such as proliferation and expansion (either due to increased cellular division or anti-apoptotic responses). Cellular proliferation can be visually measured by the observance of cellular clumping as seen under a microscope. Cellular expansion can be measured by a hemocytometer measurement. In some cases, a CAR-T cell can have increased cellular proliferation and expansion when compared to a comparable T cell, a non-CAR T cell. Increased cellular expansion can be from about 1 fold to about 20 hold over that of a comparable cell. Increased cellular expansion can be from about 1 fold, 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 5 fold, 6 fold, 7 fold, 8 fold, 9 fold, 10 fold, 11 fold, 12 fold, 13 fold, 14 fold, 15 fold, 16 fold, 17 fold, 18 fold, 19 fold, or up to 20 fold over that of a comparable cell. Cellular expansion can be measured over a period of time. For example, cellular expansion can take place from cellular acquision to the time of infusion into a subject. In other cases, cellular expansion can take place from about 1 day to up to about 30 days after acquisition. Cellular expansion can take place from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or up to 30 days after acquisition. In some cases, a rapid expansion protocol (REP) can be utilized to expand cells prior to infusion into a subject. A REP can occur over a period of about 14 days in some cases. In some cases, a CAR, when activated by binding its target, can result in other CAR activation related events such as intracellular signaling modulation, cellular differentiation, or cell death. In some cases, expression of a CAR on a cell may alter intracellular signaling of a cell. In other cases, expression of a CAR may alter cellular differentiation. Subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered to a subject exhibiting a GPC3 expressing cancer or tumor either concurrently or after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some aspects, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells are administered after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. The treatment can reduce the circulating lymphocytes in a treated subject, or substantially deplete the circulating lymphocytes the lymphocyte (i.e., lymphocyte reduction). For example, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered at least 1 hour to at least 1 week after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. For example, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered at least 1 hour, 2 hours, 4, hours, 6, hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12, hours, 14 hours, 16 hours, 18 hours, 20 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, or 7 days or longer after lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, CAR-T can be administered about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 weeks, or longer after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, host lymphopenia can facilitate expansion of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as CAR T cells. On the one hand, lymphopenia can create “space” for oncoming adoptively transferred cells and, on the other, it can induce their homeostatic expansion. The latter effect can be likely mediated through chemotherapeutic ablation of endogenous regulatory T cells, which can normally secrete inhibitory cytokines (e.g. TGF-β and IL-10) that can limit effector cell expansion, such as CAR T cells. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can improve expansion of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in vivo by about 1 fold, 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 5 fold, 6 fold, 7 fold, 8 fold, 9 fold, 10 fold, 11 fold, 12 fold, 13 fold, 14 fold, 15 fold, 16 fold, 17 fold, 18 fold, 19 fold, or up to 20 fold over treatment with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells without a lymphocyte reduction treatment. Additionally, T-cell growth homeostatic cytokines, such as IL-7 and IL-15, which may ordinarily exist in limiting amounts, may become readily available due to less competition and increased production by lymphopoietic stromal cells. Thus, induction of lymphocyte reduction prior to infusion of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells may be performed to increase efficacy of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in treating a subject. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-tumor efficacy as measured by tumor reduction or control by about 10% to about 100% over treatment without a lymphocyte reduction treatment. For example a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-tumor efficacy from about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or up to 100% over treatment without a lymphocyte reduction treatment. A lymphocyte reduction can be performed using various means. Lymphocyte reduction before anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells administration can be performed using total body irradiation (TBI) or cytotoxic drugs. Although these modalities may intended to deplete the lymphoid compartment of a recipient, they can also facilitate the presentation of tumor antigens by triggering tumor cell death and antigen release. Subsequently, these antigens can be taken up and presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs) to enhance the activation of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. Irradiation and/or chemotherapy can lead to activation of host cells, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-4, and upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy by activation of host cells. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy by upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules. In addition to enhanced APC function and availability, a preconditioning regimen can damage the integrity of mucosal barriers through radiation-induced apoptosis of cells lining these organs. Damage inflicted on the intestinal tract might permit the translocation of bacterial products, such as LPS, into the systemic circulation. LPS can in turn activate anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in vivo and might enhance the antitumor response. Thus, proinflammatory cytokines and microbial products provide crucial ‘danger signals’ for the activation and maturation of DCs, thus enhancing anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell-mediated tumor treatment. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can selectively deplete CD25-expressing cells in humans, including humanized anti-Tac (anti-CD25) and ONTAK™ (IL-2 conjugated to diphtheria toxin). In some cases, a chemotherapeutic can be administered to effect lymphocyte reduction in a subject. In some cases, a subject may receive nonmyeloablative lympho-reduction chemotherapy. A nonmyeloablative lympho-reduction chemotherapy can be any suitable such therapy, which can be administered by any suitable route. Chemotherapeutic regimens may include use of single alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil, or combinations such as CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone), CHOP (CVP and doxorubicin), C-MOPP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine), CAP-BOP (CHOP plus procarbazine and bleomycin), m-BACOD (CHOP plus methotrexate, bleomycin and leucovorin), ProMACE-MOPP (prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and leucovorin plus standard MOPP), ProMACE-CytaBOM (prednisone, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, methotrexate and leucovorin) and MACOP-B (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, fixed dose prednisone, bleomycin and leucovorin). A nonmyeloablative lympho-reduction chemotherapy can comprise, for example, administration of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, particularly if a cancer is GPC3 positive, which can be metastatic. A preferred route of administering cyclophosphamide and fludarabine can be intravenously. Likewise, any suitable dose of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine can be administered. Preferably, around 60 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide can be administered for two days after which around 25 mg/m2 fludarabine can be administered for about five days. In some cases, lymphocyte reduction can be performed to minimize immune-mediated anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell rejection. For example, a subject can be treated with cyclophosphamide (Cy) followed by fludarabine (Flu) lymphocyte reduction treatment. A dose of a chemotherapeutic such as Cy can be from about 1 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg. A dose of Cy can be from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 79 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or up to about 200 mg/kg of a subject. Alternatively, an exemplary dose and regimen for Cy treatment can be from about 0.5˜5 g/m2/day, preferably 0.6˜3 g/m2/d, more preferably 1˜2 g/m2/day, for 1-3 days, preferably 1-2 days; A dose of Flu can be from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 79 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or up to about 200 mg/m2 of a subject. Alternatively, an exemplary dose and regimen for fludarabine treatment can be from about 20˜80 mg/m2/day, preferably 25˜70 mg/m2/day or 25˜30 mg/m2/day, for 2˜10, 3˜8 or 4, 5, 6 or 7 days; In some cases, combined use of Cy and Flu can be applied. For example, initial dose of Flu in the range of about 10˜60 mg/m2/day or 15˜50 mg/m2/day or 20˜30 mg/m2/day for 2˜8 days or 3˜6 days, is followed by Cy in the amount of about 0.2˜1 mg/m2/day or 0.3˜0.8 mg/m2/day or 0.4˜0.6 g/m2/day for 1-5 or 2-3 days. In some cases, a subject can be treated with Cy and Flu at Cy 60 mg/kg×1 administration and Flu 25 mg/m2×3 to 5 administrations before anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. A subject can receive from about 0 to about 20 administrations of a lymphodepletant before an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. A subject can receive from about 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, up to about 20 administrations of a lymphodepletant, such as Cy or Flu, prior to anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. In other cases, a subject may be co-administered a lymphodepletant, such as Cy and/or Flu, concurrent with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. In other cases, a subject may be administered a lymphodepletant, such as Cy and/or Flu, after an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell administration. In other cases, a subject may be administered a lymphodepletant prior, concurrent, and/or after an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell administration. A subject may not receive a lymphocyte reduction treatment is some cases. In some cases, different doses of lymphodepletants may be used during the course of a regime. For example, a subject may receive 60 mg/kg of Cy prior to anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, followed by a dose of 40 mg/kg of Cy concurrent with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. A complete blood count (CBC) may be performed to determine the extent of lymphocyte reduction and if additional administrations may be required. In some cases, Cy may be administered alone. In other cases, Flu may be administered alone. In some cases, Cy and Flu may be alternated during a regime. Lymphocyte reduction may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell expansion. Lymphocyte reduction may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell persistence in blood. Anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell expansion and persistence may be detected by flow cytometric analysis utilizing an anti-CAR antibody. Anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell persistence may also be measured by evaluating copy number of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell by qPCR. In some cases, a subject may receive a reduction in anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell dose if subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment compared to a subject that may not receive a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can be administered over a period of time. For example a lymphocyte reduction treatment may be administered over the course of 1 min up to about 24 hours. A lymphocyte reduction treatment may be performed from 1 min, 15 min, 45 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 21 hours, 22 hours, 23 hours, or up to about 24 hours. Lympho-reduction agents may be coadministered with additional agents such as diluents, uroprotectants, excipients, or a combination thereof. For example, sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (Mesna) may be included in a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, a subject may be administered cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for about 2 days IV in 250 ml D5W with Mesna 15 mg/kg/day for 2 days over 1 hr. Mesna may be coadministered with a lymphodepletant at various doses. For example, Mesna may be administered from about 1 mg/kg/day up to about 50 mg/kg/day. Mesna may be administered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or up to about 50 mg/kg/day. In some cases, for obese or pediatric subjects a drug dosage may be calculated using practical weight. Practical weight may be an average of an actual weight and an ideal body weight. For example, ideal body weight may be calculated for a male=50 kg+2.3 (number of inches over 60 inches). An ideal body weight may be calculated for a female=45.5 kg+2.3 (number of inches over 60 inches). In some cases, a Flu administration can be 25 mg/m2/day IVPB daily over 30 minutes for 5 days. In some cases, a Flu administration can occur before a Cy administration. In some cases, a Flu administration can be performed concurrent with Cy. In some cases, a Flu administration can be performed after a Cy administration. In some cases, fludarabine can be started approximately 1 to 2 hours after the Cy and mesna. Total body irradiation can be a form of radiotherapy. As the name implies, TBI can involve irradiation of the entire body, though in modern practice the lungs can be partially shielded to lower the risk of radiation-induced lung injury. Total body irradiation can be administered at various doses. For example, total body irradiation can be administered from about 10 to about 12 Gy. In some cases, total body irradiation can be fractionated, with smaller doses delivered in several sessions, rather than delivering the entire dose at once. In some cases, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or up to 10 different doses of irradiation can be administered. The reported D0 value—the amount of ionizing radiation necessary to eradicate a particular cell type—of hematopoietic stem cells can be from about 0.5 to about 1.4 Gy, while those of human leukemia cell lines can be from about 0.8 to about 1.5 Gy, indicating that both cells are radiosensitive. The ideal dosing schedule can depend on patient age, disease and the intended type of treatment. Myeloablative TBI can be from about 12 to about 15 Gy given in about 8 to about 12 fractions over about 4 days, with about 2 to about 3 treatments daily. In some cases, myeloablative TBI can be from about 5 to about 20 Gy. Myeloablative TBI can be from about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, to about 20 Gy. In some cases, myeloablative TBI can be given in about 5 to about 20 fractions. Myeloablative TBI can be given in about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, to about 20 fractions. Myeloablative therapy can be given over about 1 to about 10 days. Myeloablatic therapy can be administered over about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or up to about 10 days. In some cases, a low-dose TBI can include doses of about 2 to about 8 Gy given in about 1 to about 4 fractions. In some cases, a low-dose TBI can include doses of about 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, or up to about 8 Gy. A low-dose TBI can be administered to a subject who may not tolerate myeloablation due to age or comorbidity. TBI can be administered using parallel opposed pairs of high-energy photon beams from about 4 to about 18 MV for TBI. In some cases, photon beams can be from about 1 to about 25 MV for TBI. Photon beams can be from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or up to about 25 MV. TCI can be performed using equipment such as a Varian Clinac iX or a Siemens Artiste. In some cases a rate of administration can be from about 5 cGy/min to about 100 cGy/min. A Rate of administration can be from about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 79 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, or up to 100 cGy/min. In some cases, certain organs can be shielded during radiation. For example, a liver, lung, brain, heart, or a combination thereof may be shielded during total body irradiation. Biological Agents In some cases, a biological agent such as an antibody can be used to deplete immune cells. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are cytolytic for lymphocytes may be an alternative means of yielding lymphocyte reduction. In some cases, an antibody for T-cell lymphocyte reduction that may be administered before anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion should be effective but short lived in vivo, to permit rapid infusion and repopulation with infused anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. Antibodies used can be directed to markers expressed on a surface of a cell, such as a lymphocyte. In some cases, lympho-reduction antibodies can be anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD45, anti-CD25, anti-CD52, and any combination thereof. Antibodies such as Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), Bortezomib, thymoglobulin (rabbit ATG, Genzyme), ATGAM (equine ATG, Pfizer), and alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) can be used. Rituximab (IDEC-C2B8), GA101, a humanized IgG1 to CD20, XmAb5574, an Fc-engineered antibody to CD19, alefacept (LFA3-Ig), fingolimod (FTY720), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), anti-CD4 antibodies, anti-CD3 antibodies, anti-CD8 antibodies, can also be used as a lymphocyte reduction agent. In some cases, Cladribine (2-CdA, Leustatin®), a purine analog similar to fludarabine, can be used. In some cases, an antibody lymphocyte reduction treatment can include a single antibody such as alemtuzumab (anti-CD52). In other cases, an antibody-based lymphocyte reduction treatment can include at least two antibodies, such as alemtuzumab and anti-CD45. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can include multiple lympho-reduction modalities, such as radiation combined with an antibody therapy or a chemotherapy combined with radiation. Chemotherapy and antibody therapy may also be used in combination. Antibiotics, Anti-fungals and Anti-virals can be given to subjects as prophylaxis during a lymphocyte reduction treatment. For example, a prophylaxis may include Altrex 500 mg daily, Bactrium DS one tablet q M W F and Fluconazole 200 mg daily. The duration of medication is until Absolute Lymphocyte count (ALC) and Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) count may return to pre medication baseline. A biological agent can also be Adriamycin. One or more cytokines can be introduced with cells. Cytokines can be utilized to boost transferred cells (including adoptively transferred tumor-specific cells) to expand within a tumor microenvironment. In some cases, IL-2 can be used to facilitate expansion of the cells described herein. Cytokines such as IL-15 can also be employed. Other relevant cytokines in the field of immunotherapy can also be utilized, such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, and, L-21, or any combination thereof. In some cases, recombinant cytokines are used. In some cases, a T-cell growth factor can be administered. A growth factor can be administered by any suitable route. If more than one T-cell growth factor is administered, they can be administered simultaneously or sequentially, in any order, and by the same route or different routes. A T-cell growth factor, such as Aldesleukin (IL-2), can be administered intravenously as a bolus injection. A dosage of a T-cell growth factor, such as IL-2, is what is considered by those of ordinary skill in the art to be high. Preferably, a dose of about 720,000 IU/kg of IL-2 can be administered three times daily until tolerance. Is come cases, about 5 to about 15 doses of IL-2 are administered, with an average of around 9 doses. A dosage of a T cell growth factor can be from about 0 to about 20. A T cell growth factor can be administered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or up to about 20 times. IL-2 can be administered at a dose of 720,000 IU/kg (based on total body weight) as an intravenous bolus. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered over a 15-minute period. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered over a 20-minute period. IL-2 can be administered by immediate injection. In some cases IL-2 can be administered over 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, or up to a period of 6 hours. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered beginning within 24 hours of cell infusion and continuing for up to about 4 days (maximum 12 doses). In some cases, IL-2 can be administered for up to about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 days after an initial administration. Doses of IL-2 can be administered every eight hours. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered from about every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 hours after an initial administration. In some cases, IL-2 dosing can be stopped if toxicities are detected. In some cases, doses can be delayed or stopped if patients reach Grade 3 or 4 toxicity due to aldesleukin except for the reversible Grade 3 toxicities common to Aldesleukin such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, skin changes, anorexia, mucositis, dysphagia, or constitutional symptoms and laboratory changes. In some cases, if these toxicities can be easily reversed within 24 hours by supportive measures, then additional doses may be given. In addition, dosing may be held or stopped at the discretion of the treating physician. In some cases, an immunoresponsive cell that expresses an anti-GPC3 CAR can have increased anti-tumor efficacy compared to a comparable immunoresponsive cell that does not express the anti-GPC3 CAR. In some cases, anti-tumor efficacy can refer to cytotoxic activity. In other cases, anti-tumor efficacy can refer to persistence. Anti-tumor efficacy can also refer to the ability of a cell to target a tumor. Anti-tumor efficacy can be measured using various in vitro assays. For example, cytotoxic ability can be measured by an ELISA that measures release of interleukin-2 (IL-2) or Interferon-γ (IFNγ). Cytotoxic activity can be measured by a killing assay such as a chromium-51 release assay or a co-culture assay. In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can have increased anti-tumor efficacy and ability when compared to comparable cells. An anti-GPC3 CAR treatment efficacy can be evaluated using multiple modalities. Efficacy can refer to anti-tumor efficacy that is the extent to which a tumor, such as a GPC3-positive tumor, is controlled, reduced, or eliminated. Treatment efficacy can also refer to CAR immunoresponsive cell expansion, persistence, tumor-targeting, and any combination thereof. A subject that can be administered an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy, such as anti-GPC3 CAR T cell therapy, can be evaluated during an infusion, immediately after an infusion, or up to years following an infusion. For example, a treated subject can return to a clinic for evaluation for a period of about 1 day to the length of the subject's life. A treated subject can be evaluated from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, or up to 90 years after an initial administration of the subject CAR immunoresponsive cells. In some cases, an evaluation schedule can include daily monitoring, weekly monitoring, monthly monitoring, or yearly monitoring. In some cases, a subject can be seen more frequently as clinically indicated. An evaluation can include a physical exam, chemistry evaluation, complete blood count, thyroid panel, toxicity assessment, computerized tomography (CT) scan of a bodily area, apheresis, and any combination thereof. In some cases, apheresis may be performed prior to and from about 1 to about 10 weeks following administration of a subject CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. At other time points, a subject's peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) can be obtained from whole blood by purification using centrifugation on a Ficoll gradiant. Aliquots of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC5) can be cryopreserved for immunological monitoring of cell function. In some cases, a variety of tests can include evaluation of specific lysis and cytokine release, metabolomic and bioenergetic studies (using Seahorse), intracellular FACS of cytokine production, ELISA-spot assays, and lymphocyte subset analysis may be used to evaluate the immunological correlates of a subject CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment. In general, differences of about 2 to about 3 fold in these assays may be indicative of true biologic differences. In some cases, different of about 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, up to about 5 fold of in vitro assays, post anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy, may be indicative of treatment efficacy. In some cases, a subject CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment may reduce tumor size by at least 30% as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scan or an MRI. An anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment may reduce tumor size by at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or up to about 100%. A CAR-T treatment may eliminate a tumor as measured by CT scan. In some cases, an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment may stabilize a tumor size as measured by a less than 10% change in a baseline measurement of a diameter of a tumor lesion as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scan. For example, a tumor may not expand in size after administration of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. In some cases, stabilization may be considered a less than 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1% change in tumor size as compared to a pre-treatment measurement. In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell efficacy can be considered in terms of subject survival time. For example, a subject that is treated with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as an anti-GPC3 CAR T cells, can survive longer than an untreated subject or a subject treated with a different therapy. In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell efficacy can be improved by the addition of a secondary treatment, such as lymphocyte reduction treatment. A secondary treatment can synergize with a anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy. In some cases, a secondary treatment can produce additive effects of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy. A secondary treatment can be lymphocyte reduction as well as additional forms of cellular therapy, antibody therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, anti-angiogenic therapy, and any combination thereof. Treatment response can be evaluated using the international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (Version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of a tumor lesion and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes can be used in the RECIST criteria. For example, measurable lesions can be those defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node can be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), can be considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, can be considered as non-measurable. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, can be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions can be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions can be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis can be added into the sum. A baseline sum diameter will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. In some cases, a clinical lesion can be considered measurable when it can be superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and about 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In cases, where a caliper cannot be used to measure a lesion, a CT scan or MRI can also be used. In some cases, a CT scan can yield slices of tissue from about 5 mm or less. A CT scan can have 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm or 0.5 mm scan thickness in some cases. If a CT scan has a slice thickness greater than 5 mm, a minimum size for a measurable lesion can be twice the slice thickness. In some cases, an MRI can also be performed to evaluate a subject. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans when determining treatment efficacy. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. In some cases, a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to measure treatment efficacy. Once a subject has been evaluated, target lesions can be grouped into stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), partial response (PR), and/or a complete response (CR). A SD can be considered neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters. A PD can be considered at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum (this can include the baseline sum if that may be the smallest). In some cases, in addition to a relative increase of about 20%, a sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least about 5 mm. A PR can be at least about 30% decrease in a sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. A CR can be elimination of target lesions. In some cases, administration of anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as anti-GPC3 CAR T cells, and a lymphocyte reduction treatment can synergistically increase a subject's median survival time by at least about 6 months as compared to administering the anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cells alone, Table 6. In some cases, a combination of an anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy and a lymphocyte reduction treatment can synergistically increase a subject's survival time by at least about 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, 10 years, or up to about 25 years as compared to administering the anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cells alone. \n",

      " Subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be formulation into a pharmaceutical medicament and be used to treat a human or mammal, in need thereof, diagnosed with a disease, e.g., cancer. These pharmaceutical medicaments can be co-administered to a human or mammal, together with one or more chemotherapeutic agent or chemotherapeutic compound. Populations of subject CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as CAR T cells, may be formulated for administration to a subject using techniques known to the skilled artisan. Formulations comprising populations of CAR immunoresponsive cells may include pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s). Excipients included in the formulations will have different purposes depending, for example, on the subpopulation of T cells used and the mode of administration. Examples of generally used excipients included, without limitation: saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water-for-injection, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof, stabilizing agents, solubilizing agents and surfactants, buffers and preservatives, tonicity agents, bulking agents, and lubricating agents. The formulations comprising populations of CAR immunoresponsive cells will typically have been prepared and cultured in the absence of any non-human components, such as animal serum. A formulation may include one population of CAR immunoresposive cells, or more than one, such as two, three, four, five, six or more populations of CAR immunoresposive cells. For example, a formulation may include one population of CAR T cells, or more than one, such as two, three, four, five, six or more populations of CAR T cells. Formulations comprising population(s) of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells may be administered to a subject using modes and techniques known to the skilled artisan. Exemplary modes include, but are not limited to, intravenous injection. Other modes include, without limitation, intratumoral, intradermal, subcutaneous (S.C., s.q., sub-Q, Hypo), intramuscular (i.m.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), intra-arterial, intramedullary, intracardiac, intra-articular (joint), intrasynovial (joint fluid area), intracranial, intraspinal, and intrathecal (spinal fluids). Any known device useful for parenteral injection of infusion of the formulations can be used to effect such administration. Formulations comprising population(s) of CAR immunoresponsive cells that are administered to a subject comprise a number of CAR immunoresponsive cells that is effective for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the specific indication or disease. Thus, therapeutically-effective populations of CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered to subjects. In general, formulations are administered that comprise between about 1×104 and about 1×1010 CAR immunoresponsive cells. In most cases, the formulation will comprise between about 1×105 and about 1×109 CAR immunoresponsive cells, from about 5×105 to about 5×108 CAR immunoresponsive cells, or from about 1×106 to about 1×107 CAR immunoresponsive cells. However, the number of CAR immunoresponsive cells administered to a subject will vary between wide limits, depending upon the location, source, identity, extent and severity of the cancer, the age and condition of the individual to be treated etc. A physician will ultimately determine appropriate dosages to be used. Tumor-targeting molecules are administered to a subject prior to, or concurrent with, or after administration of the CAR immunoresponsive cells. The tumor-targeting molecules bind to target cells in the subject by association to a tumor-associated antigen or a tumor-specific antigen. The tumor-targeting molecules may be formulated for administration to a subject using techniques known to the skilled artisan. Formulations of the tumor-targeting molecules may include pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s). Examples of generally used excipients include, without limitation: saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water-for-injection, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof, stabilizing agents, solubilizing agents and surfactants, buffers and preservatives, tonicity agents bulking agents, and lubricating agents. The tumor-targeting molecules may be administered to a subject using modes and techniques known to the skilled artisan. Exemplary modes include, but are not limited to, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intratumoral injection. Other modes include, without limitation, intradermal, subcutaneous (S.C., s.q., sub-Q, Hypo), intramuscular (i.m.), intra-arterial, intramedullary, intracardiac, intra-articular (joint), intrasynovial (joint fluid area), intracranial, intraspinal, and intrathecal (spinal fluids). In some cases, a CAR-T may be locally administered at a tumor lesion, such as a liver lesion. Any known device useful for parenteral injection or infusion of the formulations can be used to effect such administration. Formulations comprising the tumor-targeting molecules are administered to a subject in an amount that is effective for treating and/or prophylaxis of the specific indication or disease. In general, formulations comprising at least about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the tumor-targeting molecules are administered to a subject in need of treatment. In most cases, the dosage is from about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the tagged proteins daily, taking into account the routes of administration, symptoms, etc. A physician will determine appropriate dosages to be used. In one embodiment, a chimeric antigen receptor is used for stimulating an immunoresponsive cell-mediated immune response. For example, a T cell-mediated immune response is an immune response that involves the activation of T cells. Activated antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells are able to induce apoptosis in target cells displaying epitopes of foreign antigens on their surface, such as for example cancer cells displaying tumor antigens. In another embodiment, a chimeric antigen receptor is used to provide anti-tumor immunity in the mammal Due to a T cell-mediated immune response the subject will develop an anti-tumor immunity. In certain cases, methods of treating a subject having cancer can involve administering to a subject in need of treatment one or more formulations of tumor-targeting molecules, wherein these molecules bind to a cancer cell, and administering one or more therapeutically-effective populations of subject CAR immunoresponsive cells, wherein the CAR immunoresponsive cells can bind the tumor-targeting molecules and induce cancer cell death. Another embodiment can relate to methods of treating a subject having cancer comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment one or more therapeutically-effective populations of subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, wherein the CAR immunoresponsive cells bind to a cancer cell, thereby inducing cancer cell death. Administration frequencies of both formulations comprising anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells and anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in combination with tumor-targeting molecules will vary depending on factors that include the disease being treated, the elements comprising the CAR immunoresponsive cells and the tumor-targeting molecules, and the modes of administration.

In one embodiment, the anti-cancer drug is 5-fluorouracil, taxol, or leucovorin. In some cases, subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can be introduced by injection, catheter, or the like. In some cases, immunostimulatory agents can also be included, including, but not limited to, interleukins, e.g. IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-11, as well as the other interleukins, the colony stimulating factors, such as G-, M- and GM-CSF, interferons, e.g. .gamma.-interferon and erythropoietin. In some cases, a subject can be treated with a CAR-T, immunodepletant, and immunostimulant. A subject can be treated with IL-2 to boost performance of a CAR-T cellular product. In some cases, an immunostimulant can be a recombinant protein. An immunostimulant can also comprise an active portion of a protein. In some cases, an immunostimulant may only comprise a portion of a protein. A portion of a protein can be from about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or up to about 100% of a protein. Compositions comprising subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as CAR T cells, can be conveniently provided as sterile liquid preparations, e.g., isotonic aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, dispersions, or viscous compositions, which may be buffered to a selected pH. Liquid preparations are normally easier to prepare than gels, other viscous compositions, and solid compositions. Additionally, liquid compositions are somewhat more convenient to administer, especially by injection. Viscous compositions, on the other hand, can be formulated within the appropriate viscosity range to provide longer contact periods with specific tissues. Liquid or viscous compositions can comprise carriers, which can be a solvent or dispersing medium containing, for example, water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like) and suitable mixtures thereof. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating genetically modified CAR immunoresponsive cells utilized in practicing the present invention in a required amount of the appropriate solvent with various amounts of the other ingredients, as desired. Such compositions may be in admixture with a suitable carrier, diluent, or excipient such as sterile water, physiological saline, glucose, dextrose, or the like. The compositions can also be lyophilized. The compositions can contain auxiliary substances such as wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agents (e.g., methylcellulose), pH buffering agents, gelling or viscosity enhancing additives, preservatives, flavoring agents, colors, and the like, depending upon the route of administration and the preparation desired. Standard texts, such as “REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE”, 17th edition, 1985, incorporated herein by reference, may be consulted to prepare suitable preparations, without undue experimentation. Various additives which may enhance stability and sterility of the compositions, including antimicrobial preservatives, antioxidants, chelating agents, and buffers, can be added. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. According to the present invention, however, any vehicle, diluent, or additive used would have to be compatible with the genetically modified CAR immunoresponsive cells or their progenitors. In some cases, compositions can be isotonic, i.e., they can have the same osmotic pressure as blood and lacrimal fluid. The desired isotonicity of the compositions of this invention may be accomplished using sodium chloride, or other pharmaceutically acceptable agents such as dextrose, boric acid, sodium tartrate, propylene glycol or other inorganic or organic solutes. Sodium chloride is preferred particularly for buffers containing sodium ions. Viscosity of compositions, if desired, can be maintained at the selected level using a pharmaceutically acceptable thickening agent. Methylcellulose is preferred because it is readily and economically available and is easy to work with. Other suitable thickening agents include, for example, xanthan gum, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carbomer, and the like. The preferred concentration of the thickener will depend upon the agent selected. The important point is to use an amount that will achieve the selected viscosity. Obviously, the choice of suitable carriers and other additives will depend on the exact route of administration and the nature of the particular dosage form, e.g., liquid dosage form (e.g., whether the composition is to be formulated into a solution, a suspension, gel or another liquid form, such as a time release form or liquid-filled form). In some cases, for example, in the compositions, formulations and methods of treating cancer, the unit dosage of the composition or formulation administered can be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 or 100 mg. In some cases, the total amount of the composition or formulation administered can be 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 g. In some cases, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as a CAR T cell, can be administered either alone or together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, by any routes, and such administration can be carried out in both single and multiple dosages. More particularly, the pharmaceutical composition can be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hand candies, powders, sprays, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, such oral pharmaceutical formulations can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored by means of various agents of the type commonly employed for such purposes. For example, cells can be administered to a patient in conjunction with (e.g., before, simultaneously, or following) any number of relevant treatment modalities, including but not limited to treatment with agents such as antiviral therapy, cidofovir and interleukin-2, or Cytarabine (also known as ARA-C). In some cases, the engineered cells can be used in combination with chemotherapy, radiation, immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporin, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and FK506, antibodies, or other immunoablative agents such as CAMPATH, anti-CD3 antibodies or other antibody therapies, cytoxin, fludaribine, cyclosporin, FK506, rapamycin, mycoplienolic acid, steroids, FR901228, cytokines, and irradiation. The engineered cell composition can also be administered to a patient in conjunction with (e.g., before, simultaneously or following) bone marrow transplantation, T cell ablative therapy using either chemotherapy agents such as, fludarabine, external-beam radiation therapy (XRT), cyclophosphamide, or antibodies such as OKT3 or CAMPATH. In some cases, the engineered cell compositions can be administered following B-cell ablative therapy such as agents that react with CD20, e.g., Rituxan. For example, subjects can undergo standard treatment with high dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. In certain embodiments, following the transplant, subjects can receive an infusion of the engineered cells, e.g., expanded engineered cells. Additionally, expanded engineered cells can be administered before or following surgery. The engineered cells obtained by any one of the methods described herein can be used for treating patients in need thereof against Host versus Graft (HvG) rejection and Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). Therefore, a method of treating patients in need thereof against Host versus Graft (HvG) rejection and Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) comprising treating said patient by administering to said patient an effective amount of engineered cells comprising inactivated TCR alpha and/or TCR beta genes can be contemplated. Kits Disclosed herein can be kits comprising compositions. Disclosed herein can also be kits for the treatment or prevention of a cancer, pathogen infection, immune disorder or allogeneic transplant. In one embodiment, a kit can include a therapeutic or prophylactic composition containing an effective amount of a cell comprising one or more anti-GPC3 CARs in unit dosage form.

Such techniques are explained fully in the literature, such as, “Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual”, second edition (Sambrook et al., 1989); “Oligonucleotide Synthesis” (Gait, ed., 1984); “Animal Cell Culture” (Freshney, ed., 1987); “Methods in Enzymology” (Academic Press, Inc.); “Handbook of Experimental Immunology” (Wei & Blackwell, eds.); “Gene Transfer Vectors for Mammalian Cells” (Miller & Calos, eds., 1987); “Current Protocols in Molecular Biology” (Ausubel et al., eds., 1987); “PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction”, (Mullis et al., eds., 1994); and “Current Protocols in Immunology” (Coligan et al., eds., 1991). These techniques are applicable to the production of the polynucleotides and polypeptides, and, as such, can be considered in making and practicing the invention. Particularly useful techniques for are discussed in the sections that follow. Additional Applications Effective adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapies (ACT) can be useful to treat cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer) patients. For example, autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) can be modified using non-viral or viral methods disclosed herein to express an anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes GPC3 on cancer or tumor cells and can be used in the disclosed methods and kits. The present invention can be directed to compositions and methods for immunotherapy, including but not limited to cancer, using a human or humanized chimeric antigen receptor following or concurrent with a lymphocyte reduction treatment to a subject. This chimeric antigen receptor makes use of human or humanized chimeric antigen receptor constructs following or concurrent with a lymphocyte reduction treatment to a subject. These compositions and methods can provide a cancer therapy with many advantages. In some cases, a method can include modifying immunoresponsive cells to render the immunoresponsive cells substantially non-dependent upon the presence or activity of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In some cases, a polynucleic acid described herein can encode for a chimeric antigen receptor. Also disclosed are methods of making immunoresponsive cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors, such as anti-GPC3 CAR. Disclosed can also be a method of treatment in which patients with a cancer or disease can be administered anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. Described herein is a method of treating a disease (e.g., cancer) in a recipient comprising transplanting to the recipient one or more subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells following or concurrently with lymphocyte reduction treatment. Autologous lymphocyte infusion can be used in a treatment. Autologous peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) can be collected from a patient in need of treatment and T cells can be activated and expanded using methods described herein and known in the art and then infused back into the patient. In other cases, allogenic cells can be used to treat a patient. Populations of subject CAR immunoresponsive cells may be formulated for administration; and wherein the administration to a subject using techniques known to the skilled artisan. Expanded cells can then be grown under conditions similar to those for unmodified cells, whereby the modified ceils can be expanded and used for a variety of purposes. The method disclosed herein can comprise transplanting. Transplantation can refer to adoptive transplantation of a cellular product. Transplanting can be autotransplanting, allotransplanting, xenotransplanting, or any other transplanting. For example, transplanting can be xenotransplanting. Transplanting can also be allotransplanting. In some cases, about 5×1010 subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells are administered to a subject. In some embodiments, about 5×1010 cells represents a median amount of cells administered to a subject. In some embodiments, about 5×1010 cells are necessary to affect a therapeutic response in a subject. In some embodiments, at least about at least about 1×107 cells, at least about 2×107 cells, at least about 3×107 cells, at least about 4×107 cells, at least about 5×107 cells, at least about 6×107 cells, at least about 6×107 cells, at least about 8×107 cells, at least about 9×107 cells, at least about 1×108 cells, at least about 2×108 cells, at least about 3×108 cells, at least about 4×108 cells, at least about 5×108 cells, at least about 6×108 cells, at least about 6×108 cells, at least about 8×108 cells, at least about 9×108 cells, at least about 1×109 cells, at least about 2×109 cells, at least about 3×109 cells, at least about 4×109 cells, at least about 5×109 cells, at least about 6×109 cells, at least about 6×109 cells, at least about 8×109 cells, at least about 9×109 cells, at least about 1×1010 cells, at least about 2×1010 cells, at least about 3×1010 cells, at least about 4×1010 cells, at least about 5×1010 cells, at least about 6×1010 cells, at least about 6×1010 cells, at least about 8×1010 cells, at least about 9×1010 cells, at least about 1×1011 cells, at least about 2×1011 cells, at least about 3×1011 cells, at least about 4×1011 cells, at least about 5×1011 cells, at least about 6×1011 cells, at least about 6×1011 cells, at least about 8×1011 cells, at least about 9×1011 cells, or at least about 1×1012 cells. For example, about 5×1010 cells may be administered to a subject. In another example, starting with 3×106 cells, the cells may be expanded to about 5×1010 cells and administered to a subject. In some cases, cells are expanded to sufficient numbers for therapy. For example, 5×107 cells can undergo rapid expansion to generate sufficient numbers for therapeutic use. In some cases, sufficient numbers for therapeutic use can be 5×1010. Any number of cells can be infused for therapeutic use. For example, a subject may be infused with a number of cells between 1×106 to 5×1012 inclusive. A patient may be infused with as many cells that can be generated for them. In some cases, cells that are infused into a patient are not all engineered. For example, at least 90% of cells that are infused into a patient can be engineered. In other instances, at least 40% of cells that are infused into a patient can be engineered. In some embodiments, a method can comprise calculating and/or administering to a subject an amount of engineered cells necessary to affect a therapeutic response in the subject. In some embodiments, calculating the amount of engineered cells necessary to affect a therapeutic response comprises the viability of the cells and/or the efficiency with which an anti-GPC3 CAR transgene has been integrated into the genome of a cell. In some embodiments, in order to affect a therapeutic response in a subject, the cells administered to the subject may be viable cells. In some embodiments, in order to effect a therapeutic response in a subject, at least about 95%, at least about 90%, at least about 85%, at least about 80%, at least about 75%, at least about 70%, at least about 65%, at least about 60%, at least about 55%, at least about 50%, at least about 45%, at least about 40%, at least about 35%, at least about 30%, at least about 25%, at least about 20%, at least about 15%, at least about 10% of the cells are viable cells. In some embodiments, in order to affect a therapeutic response in a subject, the cells administered to a subject may be cells that have had one or more transgenes successfully integrated into the genome of the cell. In some embodiments, in order to effect a therapeutic response in a subject, at least about 95%, at least about 90%, at least about 85%, at least about 80%, at least about 75%, at least about 70%, at least about 65%, at least about 60%, at least about 55%, at least about 50%, at least about 45%, at least about 40%, at least about 35%, at least about 30%, at least about 25%, at least about 20%, at least about 15%, at least about 10% of the cells have had one or more CAR transgenes successfully integrated into a genome of a cell. In some cases, a subject can be administered subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, wherein CAR immunoresponsive cells that can be administered may be about 1 to about 35 days old. For example, administered cells may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, or up to about 40 days old. An age of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be considered from a time of stimulation. An age of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be considered from a time of apheresis. An age of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be considered from a time of transduction. In some embodiments, CAR immunoresponsive cell that can be administered to a subject are about 10 to about 14 or about 20 days old. In some cases, an “age” of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be determined by a length of a telomere. For example, a “young” CAR immunoresponsive cell can have a longer telomere length than an “exhausted” or “old” CAR immunoresponsive cell. Without being bound to a particular theory, it can be believed that immunoresponsive cells lose an estimated telomere length of about 0.8 kb per week in culture, and that young CAR immunoresponsive cell cultures can have telomeres that are about 1.4 kb longer than immunoresponsive cells that are about 44 days old. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that longer telomere lengths can be associated with positive objective clinical responses in patients and persistence of the cells in vivo. In some cases, cells are isolated from the subject organism, transfected with a nucleic acid (e.g., gene or cDNA), and re-infused back into the subject organism (e.g., patient). Cells (e.g., engineered cells or engineered primary T cells) before, after, and/or during transplantation can be functional. For example, transplanted cells can be functional for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 6, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 days after transplantation. Transplanted cells can be functional for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 months after transplantation. Transplanted cells can be functional for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 years after transplantation. In some cases, transplanted cells can be functional for up to the lifetime of a recipient. Further, transplanted cells can function at 100% of their normal intended function. Transplanted cells can also function 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or up to about 100% of their normal intended function. Transplanted cells can also function over 100% of their normal intended function. For example, transplanted cells can function 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, or up to about 5000% of their normal intended function. Transplanting can be by any type of transplanting. Sites can include, but not limited to, liver subcapsular space, splenic subcapsular space, renal subcapsular space, omentum, gastric or intestinal submucosa, vascular segment of small intestine, venous sac, testis, brain, spleen, or cornea. For example, transplanting can be subcapsular transplanting. Transplanting can also be intramuscular transplanting. Transplanting can be intraportal transplanting. After treatment (e.g., any of the treatment as disclosed herein), transplant rejection can be improved as compared to when one or more wild-type cells is transplanted into a recipient. For example, transplant rejection can be hyperacute rejection. Transplant rejection can also be acute rejection. Other types of rejection can include chronic rejection. Transplant rejection can also be cell-mediated rejection or T cell-mediated rejection. Transplant rejection can also be natural killer cell-mediated rejection. Improving transplantation can mean lessening hyperacute rejection, which can encompass a decrease, lessening, or diminishing of an undesirable effect or symptom. Transplantation can refer to adoptive transplantation of a cellular product. Another indication of successful transplantation can be the days a recipient does not require immunosuppressive therapy. For example, after treatment (e.g., transplantation) provided herein, a recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more days. This can indicate that transplantation was successful. This can also indicate that there is no rejection of the transplanted cells, tissues, and/or organs. In some cases, a recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1 day. A recipient can also require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 7 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 14 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 21 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 28 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 60 days. Furthermore, a recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more years. Another indication of successful transplantation can be the days a recipient requires reduced immunosuppressive therapy. For example, after the said treatment provided herein, a recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more days. This can indicate that transplantation was successful. This can also indicate that there is no or minimal rejection of the transplanted cells, tissues, and/or organs. For example, a recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1 day. A recipient can also require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 7 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 14 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 21 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 28 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 60 days. Furthermore, a recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more years. Reduced immunosuppressive therapy can refer to less immunosuppressive therapy compared to a required immunosuppressive therapy when one or more wild-type cells is transplanted into a recipient. Immunosuppressive therapy can comprise any treatment that suppresses the immune system. Immunosuppressive therapy can help to alleviate, minimize, or eliminate transplant rejection in a recipient. For example, immunosuppressive therapy can comprise immuno-suppressive drugs. Immunosuppressive drugs that can be used before, during and/or after transplant, but are not limited to, MMF (mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept)), ATG (anti-thymocyte globulin), anti-CD154 (CD40L), anti-CD40 (2C10, ASKP1240, CCFZ533X2201), alemtuzumab (Campath), anti-CD20 (rituximab), anti-IL-6R antibody (tocilizumab, Actemra), anti-IL-6 antibody (sarilumab, olokizumab), CTLA4-Ig (Abatacept/Orencia), belatacept (LEA29Y), sirolimus (Rapimune), everolimus, tacrolimus (Prograf), daclizumab (Ze-napax), basiliximab (Simulect), infliximab (Remicade), cyclosporin, deoxyspergualin, soluble complement receptor 1, cobra venom factor, compstatin, anti C5 antibody (eculizumab/Soliris), methylprednisolone, FTY720, everolimus, leflunomide, anti-IL-2R-Ab, rapamycin, anti-CXCR3 antibody, anti-ICOS antibody, anti-OX40 antibody, and anti-CD122 antibody. Furthermore, one or more than one immunosuppressive agents/drugs can be used together or sequentially. One or more than one immunosuppressive agents/drugs can be used for induction therapy or for maintenance therapy. The same or different drugs can be used during induction and maintenance stages. In some cases, daclizumab (Zenapax) can be used for induction therapy and tacrolimus (Prograf) and sirolimus (Rapimune) can be used for maintenance therapy. Daclizumab (Zenapax) can also be used for induction therapy and low dose tacrolimus (Prograf) and low dose sirolimus (Rapimune) can be used for maintenance therapy Immunosuppression can also be achieved using non-drug regimens including, but not limited to, whole body irradiation, thymic irradiation, and full and/or partial splenectomy. These techniques can also be used in combination with one or more immuno-suppressive drugs. EXAMPLES The invention is further described in detail by reference to the following experimental examples. These examples are provided for purposes of illustration only, and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified. Thus, the invention should in no way be construed as being limited to the following examples, but rather, should be construed to encompass any and all variations which become evident as a result of the teaching provided herein. Example 1: Construction of Anti-GPC3-CAR Vector An exemplary lentiviral plasmid vector was constructed using a third-generation of self-inactivating lentiviral vector system. The system contains packaging plasmid pMDLg RRE encoding Gag/Pol (Addgene), packaging plasmid pRSV-REV encoding Rev (Addgene), envelope plasmid pCMV-VSV-G encoding VSV-G (Addgene), and a recombinant expression vector encoding a CAR gene based in an empty vector pRRLSIN-cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE (Addgene). The system can effectively lower the risk of forming replication capable lentivirus (RCL) particles. The empty vector pRRLSIN-cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE contains a promoter of elongation factor-1 α (EF-1α), and insert MluI cleavage site between the promoter and CD8αsp signal peptide. Specifically, the pWPT-EGFP vector (Addgene) was double digested with ClaI/SalI (NEB) to recover DNA fragments of 1.1 Kb, which were then ligated with T4 DNA ligase to pRRLSIN-cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE which was double digested with ClaI/SalI. The ligation mixture was then transformed into host cell TOP10. Positive clones were identified by colony PCR and confirmed by sequencing, giving rise to recombinant plasmid pRRLSIN-cPPT.EF-1α-EGFP.WPRE. EF-1α promoter (SEQ ID NO: 33, including Mlu I cleavage site) of the CD8a signal domain (aka Fragment 1, 442 bp) was amplified with upstream primer 5′-gcaggggaaagaatagtagaca-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 31), downstream primer 5′-CGGCCTGGCGGCGTGGAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 32), and pRRLSIN-cPPT.EF-1α-EGFP.WPRE as template, and the amplification was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 30 s, annealing at 53° C. for 30 s, and extension at 68° C. for 30 s; and after 25 cycles, extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The amplified band was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis to have the expected fragment size. Humanized antibody 35 has been described in Chinese Patent Application No. CN201510481235.1, which is capable of specifically recognizing humanized GPC3 protein. To construct 35-CAR lentiviral plasmid, the following were used in amplification to provide heavy chain variable domain fragment: fragment containing heavy chain variable domain 35 (SEQ ID NO: 80 in CN201510481235.1) as template, upstream primer 5′-ctccacgccgccaggccggaggtgcagctggtgcag-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 34), and downstream primer 5′-GCGGTGTCCTCGCTCCGCAGGCTGCTCAGCTCCATGTAGGCGGTG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 35); the following were used to provide light chain variable domain fragment: fragment containing light chain variable domain of 35 (SEQ ID NO: 79 CN201510481235.1 as template, upstream primer 5′-GCGGAGCGAGGACACCGCCGTGTACTACTGCGCCCGGTTCTACAGCTAC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 36), and downstream primer 5′-CGGCGCTGGCGTCGTGGTACG TTTGATCTCCAGCTTGGTG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 37). The heavy chain and light chain variable domain primers were amplified with bridging PCR to provide 35 scFv fragment (SEQ ID NO: 38, aka Fragment 2, 765 bp), which comprises a sequence repetitive to the upstream CD8a signal peptide and the downstream hinge region. PCR amplification was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 40 s, annealing at 58° C. for 40 s; extension at 68° C. for 40 s; and after 25 cycles, an extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The amplified band was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis to have the expected fragment size. The upstream primer 5′-accacgacgccagcgccg-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 39) and downstream primer 5′-aatccagaggttgattgtcgacctagcgagggggcagggcctgc-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 40) were used, with pWPT-eGFP-F2A-GPC3-28Z as a template (See Chinese Patent Application CN 104140974 A), to amplify Hinge-28Z (SEQ ID NO: 41, Fragment 3, 703 bp) (with internal Sal I cleavage site). PCR amplification was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 30 s; annealing at 60° C. for 30 s; extension at 68° C. for 30 s; and after 25 cycles, final extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The amplified band was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis to have the expected fragment size. An equimolar amount (about 50 ng) of Fragment 1, Fragment 2 and Fragment 3 were amplified by overlap PCR under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 40 s; annealing at 60° C. for 40 s; extension at 68° C. for 140 s; and after 5 cycles, final extension at 68° C. for 10 min. DNA polymerase, upstream primer 5′-gcaggggaaagaatagtagaca-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 31) and downstream primer 5′-aatccagaggttgattgtcgacctagcgagggggcagggcctgc-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 40) were then supplemented to the mixture, and amplified for 25 cycles under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 40 s; annealing at 60° C. for 40 s; extension at 68° C. for 140 s; and final extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The theoretical size of the resulting 35-28Z (SEQ ID NO: 41) was 1874 bp. The amplified product was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and had the expected fragment size, and sequence as shown as SEQ ID NO: 23. The vector pRRLSIN-cPPT.EF-1α-EGFP.WPRE vector and 35-28Z were digested with MluI and SalI, and then ligated with T4 ligase, and transformed into TOP10. Positive clones were identified with colony PCR and sequenced by Invitrogen to confirm that pRRL-EF-1α-35-28Z was obtained. Example 2: Packaging of Anti-GPC3-CAR Lentivirus Anti-GPC3-CAR lentivirus stock solution (0.75 L) was prepared using Embryonic Kidney Cells 293 T (ATCC: CRL-11268). Specifically, 293T cells were seeded at 1.17×104/cm2 onto a 5-layer cellstack (Corning). Solution A was prepared at the day of transfection to comprise 133.2 μg of packaging plasmid pRSV-Rev, 133.2 μg of pMDLg/pRRE, 51.56 μg of pCMV-VSV-G and 111.7 μg of pRRL-EF-1α-35-28Z, by dissolving 966 μg of all the plasmid into 17 ml DMEM basal medium and gently mixing it. Solution B was prepared by dissolving 2.9 mg PEI (Polysciences) into 17 ml DMEM basal medium, and the solution was gently mixed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Solution A was then introduced into Solution B, homogenously mixed, and allowed to stand still at room temperature for 20 min to 25 min. The 293 T culture solution was then transferred from a Cellstack into a 1 L flask. The combined solution comprising plasmid and PEI was then introduced into the culture solution and mixed gently. The resulting solution was then transferred into a Cellstack, and incubated for 5 h at 37° C., 5% CO2 before the medium was changed to fresh growth medium DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technology). The culture was then incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2 for 48 h. The lentiviral stock solution was then recovered, filtered with a 0.45 μm (Millipore) filter, concentrated and purified with KrosFlo® IIi Tangential Flow Filtration System (Spectrum), and washed with AIM-V(Life technology) and stored. Titration of virus was conducted according to the method described in CN104140974A. Virus titer was calculated to be about 1×108/ml. The virus was packaged at 1×108/vial, and stored at −80° C. for later use. Example 3: Preparation of Anti-GPC3-CAR T Cells and In Vitro Anti-Tumor Assay Against Liver Cancer Cells CAR T cells were prepared in an immune cell preparatory lab following cGMP standards. Specifically, peripheral blood of subjects or white blood cell enriched blood obtained using a COBE Spectra blood component separator were separated by density gradient centrifugation to obtain human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). PBMCs were mixed with magnetic beads coated with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Life technology) at a ratio of PMBC to magnetic beads of 1:3, stimulated with recombinant human IL-2 at a final concentration of 300 U/mL (Shanghai Hua Xin High Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) and cultivated for 48 h. Subsequently, the aforementioned lentivirus was used to transduce the activated T cells at MOI of approximately 5, with efficiency of transduction enhanced by RetroNectin (Takara). 24 h and 48 h following transduction, free viruses were removed by medium change through low-speed centrifugation (100 g×10 min). 72 h following transduction, the magnetic beads were removed. The aforementioned centrifugation was repeated, and a sub-culture was obtained at a density of 5×105/mL. Subsequently, the cells were sub-cultured every other day at a density of about 3×105/mL while recombinant human IL-2 was added into the lymphocyte culture medium at a final concentration of 300 U/mL. The transduced CAR T cells were assayed for their expression of CAR by flow cytometry following in vitro cultivation for 10 to 12 days. That is, positive transduction rates of the CAR T cells were assayed and are shown in Table 7. Moreover, an in vitro anti-tumor assay was conducted by co-incubation with high GPC3 expressing liver cancer cells Huh-7, low GPC3 expressing PLC/PRF/5, and GPC3 negative SK-HEP-1 for 18 h at an effector to target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. For a detailed procedure, refer to CN104140974A. In vitro anti-tumor activity results at the effector to target ratio of 1:1 are presented in Table 8. Results show that anti-GPC3-CAR T cells expressed a CAR ranging from about 40% to about 80%. Furthermore, the anti-GPC3-CAR T cells had specific killing of GPC3 positive Huh-3 and PLC/PRF/5 with a dose dependent effect on the effector-to-target ratio, whereas they did not have killing effect on GPC3 negative SK-HEP-1 (Table 8), indicating that anti-GPC3-CAR T cells prepared from the subjects in the present disclosure have excellent targeted killing effects. \n",

      " Example 4: Change of Lymphocytes after Lymphocyte Reduction After confirmation that no abnormality occurred during anti-GPC3-CAR T cell preparation from treated subjects, the subjects were subjected to a comprehensive assessment of various physical conditions to determine whether the subjects were suitable for in vivo lymphocyte reduction. A primary lymphocyte reduction protocol was designed for administration to suitable subjects. The following two lymphocyte reduction protocols were designed: Protocol 1: cyclophosphamide (CTX) single agent lymphocyte reduction protocol, at a dose of 1 g/m2/day×1 day. Protocol 2: combined fludarabine (FLU)+cyclophosphamide lymphocyte reduction protocol, at a dose of 20˜30 mg fludarabine/m2/day×4 days+500 mg cyclophosphamide/m2/day×2 days. The protocol was implemented with adjustment to include the following conditions: calculation of human surface area was conducted according to Stevenson's formula (Chinese Journal of Physiology, 12:327, 1937). That is, surface area (m2)=0.0061×height (cm)+0.0128×weight (kg)−0.1529. For example, an adult having a height of 170 cm and a weight of 60 kg has a surface area of 1.6521 m2. Subjects not suitable for lymphocyte reduction due to existing physical conditions or on their own volition were assigned to a second queue. Different lymphocyte reduction treatments were performed on a total of three subjects (H01, H02, and H03). One subject (H04) was not subjected to ablation due to physical conditions and their volition. Protocols are presented in Table 9. \n",

      " H01′ indicates an initial administration of anti-GPC3-CAR T cell therapy to subject H01; H012 indicates a second administration of anti-GPC3-CAR T cell therapy to subject H01; and D0 was defined as the day when anti-GPC3-CAR T cell administration was conducted. Following implementation of the aforementioned lymphocyte reduction protocols, various changes occurred in the absolute values of lymphocytes in the subjects. As a result of the lymphocyte reduction treatment of cyclophosphamide as a single agent, lymphocytes decreased by about 40% to about 72%. The combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphocyte reduction yielded a more significant difference in lymphocyte reduction, at about 82% to about 96.5%, as compared to the cyclophosphamide single agent administration Specifically, FIG. 2 demonstrates the change of the ratio of the absolute number of lymphocytes to the baseline at each monitored time point before and after lymphocyte reduction treatment administration. The aforementioned results demonstrate that the combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide results in superior lymphocyte reduction as compared to the cyclophosphamide single agent reduction protocol. Example 5: Clinical Response of Subjects Following Ablation About 2 days after the implementation of lymphocyte reduction, subjects were administered anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment by intravenous administration. The doses of the administered anti-GPC3-CAR T cells are presented in Table 7. The clinical responses of the subjects following the treatment are summarized in Table 10. The results demonstrate that the three subjects that underwent lymphocyte reduction have stable disease (SD) or partial disease (PR) following the anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment up to now. In contrast, the subject H04, that did not receive the lymphocyte reduction treatment, shows progressive disease by MRI 4 weeks following the anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment. As to AFP results, the subject H02 could not be assessed for prognosis from the tumor marker due to AFP insensitivity. For two other subjects, their AFP levels somewhat decreased, as in Table 10. It should be noted that the subject H03, after lymphocyte reduction using combined fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, showed an 87% reduction of AFP as compared to the baseline before the treatment. Meanwhile, imaging shows that the target site has partial clinical response. FIG. 3 shows MRI results from subject H03 before treatment vs. 10 weeks post-treatment. \n",

      " Moreover, cytokine release syndrome, which often occurs during treatment of blood cancers using CAR T cells, was not observed in this clinical study, indicating that anti-GPC3-CAR T cells are safe. In sum, the results of the clinical studies using CAR-GPC T cells to treat GPC3 positive hepatocellular cancer demonstrate that subjects with effective lymphocyte reduction were conferred with certain clinical benefits by anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment, whereas the subjects without lymphocyte reduction therapy were not conferred any clinical benefit. Further, neither of the subjects with and without lymphocyte reduction exhibited intolerable toxic or side effect, with both of them having certain adverse responses such as fever and increased CRP, indicating that the lymphocyte reduction might not have worsened the adverse response of the subjects. Further, as regards to the effect of lymphocyte reduction therapy and benefit to the subjects, the combined fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphocyte reduction protocol may be superior to the cyclophosphamide single agent lymphocyte reduction protocol. In sum, anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment following implementation of effective lymphocyte reduction may provide an effective therapeutic solution to clinical treatment of GPC3 positive hepatocellular carcinoma. Example 6: Phenotypic Analysis Expression of cell surface molecules is determined by flow cytometry using standard methodology. The following monoclonal antibodies conjugated with phycoerythrin, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and/or peridinin chlorophyll protein are used: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD30, CCR4, CD45RA, CD45RO, CCR7, CD62L, CD56, αβT-cell receptor (BD Biosciences PharMingen). Expression of CAR by T cells is detected using an anti-CAR antibody. Samples are analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences PharMingen), and data is analyzed by CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). At least 10,000 positive events are measured for each sample. Example 7: Cytotoxicity Assay: Liver Cancer To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effect of the second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells, a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was performed. Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 33-28BBZ, 92-28BBZ, and 4-28BBZ, were co-cultured with control cells, SK-HEP-1 (FIG. 4A) and CHO-K1 (FIG. 4B), at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. To evaluate anti-tumor cytotoxicity CAR-T cells, 33-28BBZ, 92-28BBZ, and 4-28BBZ, were co-cultured with GPC3-positive liver cancer cells, Huh-7, or control cells transduced to express GPC3, CHO-K1-GPC3+, at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C., FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B respectively. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. For all effector: target ratios, the cytotoxicity was obtained as the average value of 5 repetitive wells. Results Cytotoxicity data show that 33-28BBZ, 92-28BBZ, and 4-28BBZ CAR-T constructs had cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines expressing GPC3 while having no cytotoxicity to non-GPC3 expressing control lines at 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. Example 8: Cytotoxicity Assay: Liver Cancer Panel To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effect of the second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells, a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was performed. Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 92-28Z, 92-BBZ, 92-28BBZ, or mock were co-cultured with HepG2 (HCC)(FIG. 6A), Hep3B (HCC)(FIG. 6B), or PLC/PRF/5 (Hepatoma)(FIG. 6C) at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of the second and third generation CAR-T a similar CytoTox 96® assay was performed using 92-28Z, 92-BBZ, 92-28BBZ, or mock co-cultured with high GPC3 expressing liver cancer cells, Huh-7, FIG. 7A. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. Results Cytotoxicity data show that both second and third generation constructs had comparable cytotoxicity across all liver cancer panels including HCC and hepatoma tumor cell lines at 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. The second and third generation contruts were able to target tumor cells of varying levels of GPC3 expression, revealing a broad range of tumor targeting potential. Example 9: Cytotoxicity Assay: Gastric Carcinoma To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effect of the second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells in a gastric carcinoma tumor setting, a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was performed. Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 92-28Z, 92-28BBZ, or mock were co-cultured with KATO-III at effector-to-target ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. Results Cytotoxicity data shows that both second and third generation constructs had comparable cytotoxicity against the gastric carcinoma tumor line, KATO-III, FIG. 7B, which mock transduced cells had no activity. Data suggests that CAR-T cells are specific to their tumor target and show no reacticity to tissues that does not express the GPC3 antigen. Example 10: Comparison of scFv 33 Versus scFv 92 To compare CAR-T with different scFv's to GPC3, second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells were used in a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 33-28Z, 92-28Z, 92-BBZ, 92-28BBZ, or mock were co-cultured with Huh-7 cells or control cells, A431 (GPC3 neg), at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C.Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. Results Cytotoxicity data shows that constructs with the scFv 92 had increased cytotoxicy as compared to constructs with scFv 33 at 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 effector to target ratios, FIG. 10B. Cytotoxicity was antigen specific as there was no cytotoxicity detected in the cocultured with the GPC3 neg tumor cell line A431, FIG. 10A. Example 11: Comparison of Second and Third Generation CAR-T To compare second and third generation CAR-T CAR-T transduced T cells were used in a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 4-28Z, 4-28BBZ, 4-4-28BBZ, 4-14-28BBZ, 4-20-28BBZ, 4-35-28BBZ, 4-42-28BBZ or mock-transduced were co-cultured with Huh7 (HCC) cells at effector: target ratio of 3:1, or 1:1 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. Results Cytotoxicity data show that both second and third generation constructs had cytotoxicity with 4-20-28BBZ, 4-35-28BBZ, and 4-42-28BBZ having higher cycotoxicity as measured by increased lysis, FIG. 9. Example 12: Proliferation Assay Proliferation of anti-GPC3 CAR-T after exposure to target cells (Huh-7, GPC3+) or control cells (SK-HEP-1, GPC3-) is determined by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester dilution assays. One week post-transduction, control T lymphocytes and anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells are labeled with 1.5 μmol/L carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Invitrogen) and plated with irradiated tumor targets (GPC3 positive and GPC3 negative lines) at an effector-to-target (E: T) ratio of 5:1. CFSE dilution is measured on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry on day 4 of co-culture. Example 13: Patient Derived Tumor Graft Murine Model and Lymphocyte Reduction NOD/SCID mice were each implanted with 2×2×2 mm lung cancer tumors. On approximately day 27 post implantation or when tumor size, reached 220 mm3, mice were administered cyclophosphamide intravenously and either 1×107 mock, hu92-28Z, or hu92-28BBZ CAR-T cells intraperitonealy. A second administration followed on day 34. Tumor volume was measured using caliper measurement approximately every 3-7 days until day 52 post tumor inoculation. Results On day 51 post tumor inoculation, mice treated with 92-28Z, second generation CAR-T, had significantly reduced tumor size as compared to mice treated with 92-28BBZ, third generation CAR-T, or saline, FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B. Mice treated with 92-28Z, second generation CAR-T, also had significantly reduced tumor weight as compared to mice treated with 92-28BBZ, third generation CAR-T, or saline, FIG. 8C. Mice treated with 92-28Z, second generation CAR-T, also had significantly reduced inhibition as compared to mice treated with 92-28BBZ, third generation CAR-T, or saline, FIG. 8D. Example 14: Xenograft HCC Murine Model 8- to 12-week old NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtmlWjl/SzJ (NSG) mice (Bar Harbor, Me.) were implanted with 0.5×106 Huh-7 tumor cells on their left flank. 7 days post tumor inoculation mice were treated with 1×107 mock-transduced T cells, hu92-28Z, or hu92-28BBZ by tail vein injection. Following treatment mice were monitored by caliper measurement at least once a week for 35 days post tumor cell inoculation. Results Treatment with hu92-28Z and hu92-28BBZ had significant anti-tumor activity as compared to mice treated with mock-transduced T cells. FIG. 11A shows that mice treated with hu92-28Z or hu92-28BBZ had significantly reduced tumor volume on day 35 post tumor cell inoculation. FIG. 11B shows that mice treated with hu92-28Z or hu92-28BBZ had significantly smaller tumors as evidenced by their reduced weight measurements as compared to mice treated with mock transduced cells. FIG. 11C shows images of the xenograft tumors. Example 15: Clinical Expansion of Anti-GPC3 CAR T Cells In order to generate a large number of transduced T cells, the cells are induced to proliferate using a rapid expansion protocol (REP). Prior to being used in REPs, T cells are started in culture with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and IL-2 and transduced on the second day after the initiation of culture as detailed above. The cells are cultured in a 75 cm2 flask at 37° C. and 5% CO2. The cells are counted and suspended at a concentration of 0.5×106 cells/mL in fresh T cell medium with 300 IU/mL of IL-2 every two days for the remainder of the time they will be kept in culture. Example 16: Clinical Trial Patients with evaluable liver cancer undergo apheresis to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Lymphocytes are isolated, virally transduced with an anti-GPC3 CAR, expanded, and aliquots taken for immunologic testing. On days −7 and −6 before CAR-T administration, patients undergo a preparative regime of cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg/day×2 days IV over 1 hr. On days −7 and −3 before CAR-T administration, patients undergo a preparative regime of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day IVPB daily over 30 minutes for 5 days. During the preparative regimen, patients undergo daily complete blood count (CBC) testing. In the first part of a phase I study a dose escalation is initiated utilizing one patient per group starting at 109 anti-GPC3 CAR-T per patient. Individual patients are treated at half log increments. Thus the following doses will be utilized: 109, 3×109 cells, 1010 cells, 3×1010 cells, and up to 1×1011 cells. Autologous anti-GPC3 CAR-T are administered intravenously over 20 to 30 minutes via non-filtered tubing. All patients return to the clinic for evaluation 6 weeks following administration of the CAR-T cell product. \n",

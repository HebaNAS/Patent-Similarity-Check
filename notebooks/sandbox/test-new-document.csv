FIG. 8[0260] An incapacitance device (IITC Inc. Life Science,
Woodland, Calif., USA) was used to measure hindpaw
weight bearing, a postural effect of pain. The rats were
manually held in a vertical position over the apparatus with
the hindpaws resting on separate metal scale plates and the
entire weight of the rat was supported on the hindpaws. The
duration of each measurement was 6 seconds and 10 con-
secutive measurements were taken at 60-second intervals.
Eight readings (excluding the highest and lowest ones) were
averaged to calculate the bilateral hindpaw weight-bearing
values. Weight bearing data were analyzed as the ratio
between right (fracture) and left hindpaw weight bearing
values ((2R/(R+L))x100%).

Edema Assessment

[0261] A laser sensor technique was used to determine the
dorsal-ventral thickness of the hindpaw. Before baseline
testing the bilateral hindpaws were tattooed with a 2 to 3 mm
spot on the dorsal skin over the midpoint of the third
metatarsal. For laser measurements each rat was briefly
anesthetized with isoflurane and then held vertically so the
hindpaw rested on a table top below the laser. The paw was
gently held flat on the table with a small metal rod applied
to the top of the ankle joint. Using optical triangulation, a
laser with a distance measuring sensor was used to deter-
mine the distance to the table top and to the top of the
hindpaw at the tattoo site and the difference was used to
calculate the dorsal-ventral paw thickness. The measure-
ment sensor device used in these experiments (4381 Preci-
cura, Limab, Goteborg, Sweden) has a measurement range
of 200 mm with a 0.01 mm resolution.

Hindpaw Temperature Measurement

[0262] The temperature of the hindpaw was measured
using a fine wire thermocouple (Omega, Stanford, Conn.,
USA) applied to the paw skin. Six sites were tested per
hindpaw. The six measurements for each hindpaw were
averaged for the mean temperature.

Results

[0263] As illustrated in FIG. 3, treatment with orally
administered zoledronic acid reversed pain, restored weight
bearing, and prevented edema as compared to vehicle treated
animals.

[0264] As illustrated in FIG. 4, von Frey pain thresholds
for the right (fracture) hindpaw were reduced by 72% versus
the contralateral (normal) hindpaw in vehicle treated ani-
mals. Zoledronate treatment reversed fracture induced pain
by 77% as compared to vehicle treatment.

[0265] As illustrated in FIG. 5, reduction in weight bear-
ing, a postural effect of pain, was significantly higher in the
vehicle treated group as compared to the zoledronic acid
treated group. Weight bearing on the fracture hindlimb was
reduced to 55% of normal in the vehicle treated group.
Zoledronate treatment significantly restored hindlimb
weight bearing as compared to vehicle treatment (86% of
normal).

[0266] As illustrated in FIG. 6, the expected increase in
hindpaw thickness was greater in the vehicle treated group
as compared to the zoledronic acid treated group, reflecting
the development of edema. Zoledronate treatment reduced
hindpaw edema by 60% versus vehicle treatment.

[0267] Zoledronic acid reduced hindpaw warmth by 5%
versus vehicle treatment.

[0268] The daily dose in the above experiment was 18
meg/m7/day. Under current FDA guidelines, the reference
body surface area of a human adult is 1.62 m~. Thus, a daily

dose of 18 mg/m? corresponds to a monthly dose of about
500-560 mg/m? or a human dose of about 800-900 mg.

Example 4. Solubility of Disodium Salt of
Zoledronic Acid

[0269] The aqueous solubility of zoledronic acid and
disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate was determined. One
gram of the test compound was measured in to a beaker.
Demineralized water (pH 5.5) was then added in small
increments to the test compound, and sonication was applied
to the mixture. The procedure was continued until complete
dissolution was achieved. Full dissolution was determined to
have been reached when a clear solution was present with no
visible material. The volume of water required to reach full
dissolution was used to calculate a solubility value
expressed in grams per 100 mL. The procedure was per-
formed for each compound.

Results

[0270] As shown in FIG. 7, the aqueous solubility of
disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate 1s approximately 50 times
that of zoledronic acid. Disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate
has a solubility of 12.5 g/100 mL compared to only 0.25
2/100 mL for zoledronic acid.

Example 5. Bioavailability of Orally Administered
Zoledronic Acid and Disodium Zoledronate

[0271] Tablets were manufactured containing either pure
zoledronic acid or the disodium salt of zoledronic acid
(disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate). Both types of tablets
contained 50 mg of zoledronic acid equivalent per tablet.
Identical excipients were used in both types of tablets, with
amounts adjusted to account for the difference in molecular
weights between the acid and the disodium salt.

[0272] Beagle dogs were orally administered tablets con-
taining 150 mg zoledronic acid equivalent either in the form
of disodium zoledronate (Group 1) or pure zoledronic acid
(Group 2). Each animal was given three 50 mg equivalent
tablets (150 mg total), which were administered together.
The animal’s oral cavity was wetted with water before
placing the tablets on the back of the animal’s tongue.
Animals were fasted before and after dosing. Animals were
6 to 9 months of age and weighed 6 to 10 kg on the day of
dosing. There were three dogs per group.

[0273] Serial blood samples were collected from each
animal by venipuncture of the jugular vein at various points
after dosing for measurement of plasma concentrations of
zoledronic acid. Blood samples were collected into chilled
tubes containing K,EDTA as the anticoagulant. Samples
were then centrifuged at approximately 3000 rpm at +4° C.
for 10 minutes for plasma derivation. Plasma concentrations
of zoledronic acid were measured using an LC/MS/MS
method.

Results

[0274] The average plasma concentrations of zoledronic
acid for each group of dogs is summarized in Table 1 andPain Threshold (g)

[0002] Bisphosphonate compounds are potent inhibitors
of osteoclast activity, and are used clinically to treat bone-
related conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget’s disease
of bone; and cancer-related conditions including multiple
myeloma, and bone metastases from solid tumors. They
generally have low oral bioavailability.

[0003] Patchy osteoporosis and bone marrow edema may
result from osteoclast hyperactivity. Zoledronic acid is a
potent inhibitor of bone resorption and osteoclast activity.
Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic
acid, also inhibit the mevalonate pathway in the osteoclast
thereby interrupting normal osteoclast function.

[0004] It has been discovered that oral dosage forms of
bisphosphonate compounds, such as zoledronic acid, can be
used to treat or alleviate pain or related conditions.

[0005] Some embodiments include a method of enhancing
the oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid comprising orally
administering a dosage form containing zoledronic acid in
the disodium salt form.

[0006] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form, wherein
the bioavailability, in a mammal, of zoledronic acid in the

disodium salt form is greater than the bioavailability of
zoledronic acid in the diacid form would be in the same
dosage form.

[0007] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in an acid or a salt form, such as the
disodium salt form, wherein the dosage form contains an
amount of zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form that
provides an area under the plasma concentration curve of
zoledronic acid of about 4 ng-h/mL to about 2000 ng-h/mL
to a human being to which the dosage form is administered.
[0008] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form, wherein
the disodium salt form is present in a lower molar amount
than would be present if the zoledronic acid were in the
diacid form; and wherein the zoledronic acid in the disodium
salt form has an improved bioavailability as compared to the
zoledronic acid in the diacid form to the extent that the lower
molar amount of the disodium salt in the dosage form does
not reduce the amount of zoledronic acid delivered to the
plasma of a mammal.

[0009] Although an oral dosage form with enhanced bio-
availability with respect to the bisphosphonate compound
can be used, the treatment can also be effective using an oral
dosage form that includes a bisphosphonate compound, such
as zoledronic acid, wherein the bioavailability of the bis-
phosphonate is unenhanced, or is substantially unenhanced.
[0010] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising administering an oral dosage
form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal in need
thereof, wherein the mammal experiences significant pain
relief more than 3 hours after administration of the dosage
form.

[0011] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
pain associated with an arthritis comprising administering an
oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a human
being in need thereof.

[0012] Some embodiments include a method of treating
complex regional pain syndrome comprising administering
an oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal
in need thereof.

[0013] Some embodiments include an oral dosage form
comprising zoledronic acid, wherein the oral bioavailability
of zoledronic acid is substantially unenhanced. For example,
in some embodiments, the oral bioavailability in the dosage
form is about 0.01% to about 4%.

[0014] Some embodiments include a pharmaceutical prod-
uct comprising more than one unit of an oral dosage form
described herein. In some embodiments, each unit of the oral
dosage form contains about 1 mg to about 50 mg of
zoledronic acid.

[0015] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising administering an oral dosage
form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal in need
thereof.

[0016] Insome embodiments, the mammal receives a total
monthly dose of zoledronic acid that is about 800 mg/m? or
less.

[0017] In some embodiments, the dosage form contains
about 10 mg/m? to about 20 mg/m? based upon the body
surface area of the mammal.

[0018] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising orally administering zole-
dronic acid to a mammal in need thereof.TABLE 3

FIG. 1[0062] In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity can be used to treat bone marrow lesions.

[0063] In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity can be used to treat bone marrow lesions of the knee,
shoulder, ankle, wrist, hand, fingers, spine, or hip.

[0064] Commonly used measures of pain intensity include
the visual analog scale (VAS) and the numerical rating scale
(NRS). With the VAS approach, patients rate the severity of
their pain by marking a point on a 10-cm (or 100 mm) VAS
(O=no pain and 10=worst possible pain). With the NRS
approach, patients rate the severity of their pain by verbally
responding to a 10-point NRS (O=no pain and 10=worst
possible pain). VAS and NRS scores have been shown to be
strongly correlated (slope of regression line, 1.01), indicat-
ing that a score on the 10-cm VAS is equivalent to the same
score on 10-point NRS (Bijur P E et al. Acad Emerg Med
2003; 10:390-392). For example, a VAS score of 5 cm (or 50
mm) is equivalent to an NRS score of 5. Knee pain in a
person with a VAS score of 5 cm or 50 mm or higher, or an
NRS score of 5 or higher, may be referred to herein as
moderate to severe knee pain.

[0065] In some embodiments, the patient suffering from
pain, inflammation, a similar condition, or any of the con-
ditions described herein, has an NRS of 5 or greater, or a
VAS of 5 cm or greater. In some embodiments, the patient
has an NRS of 4 or greater, or a VAS of 4 cm or greater. In
some embodiments, the patient has an NRS of 6 or greater,
or a VAS of 6 cm or greater. In some embodiments, the
patient has an NRS of 7 or greater, or a VAS of 7 cm or
greater. In some embodiments, the patient has an NRS of
about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about
7, about 8, about 9, or about 10. In some embodiments, the
patient has a VAS of about 1 cm, about 2 cm, about 3 cm,
about 4 cm, about 5 cm, about 6 cm, about 7 cm, about 8 cm,
about 9 cm, or about 10 cm.

[0066] For knee pain or pain associated with bone marrow
lesions, in some embodiments, treatment with a nitrogen-
containing bisphosphonate such as zoledronic acid may
decrease the visual analog (VAS) pain score measured using
a 100 mm scale, by at least about 5 mm, at least about 8 mm,
at least about 10 mm, at least about 15 mm, up to about 50
mm, or up to about 100 mm. In some embodiments, the VAS
score, may be decreased by at least about 5 mm, at least
about 8 mm, at least about 10 mm, at least about 15 mm, up
to about 50 mm, or up to about 100 mm, as compared to a
placebo.

[0067] Treatment with a nitrogen-containing bisphospho-
nate such as zoledronic acid may decrease the numerical
rating scale (NRS) pain score measured using a 0-10 scale,
by at least about 0.1, at least about 0.5, at least about 0.8, at
least about 1, at least about 1.5, up to about 5, or up to about
10. In some embodiments, the NRS score may be decreased
by at least about 0.1, at least about 0.5, at least about 0.8, at
least about 1, at least about 1.5, up to about 5, or up to about
10, as compared to a placebo.

[0068] In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity can be used to reduce the size of bone marrow
lesions. The area of the lesions may be measured as the total
area of all lesions or as the area of any one lesion. In some
embodiments, the total area includes the medial tibial area,
the medial femoral area, the lateral tibial area, and the lateral
femoral area. In some embodiments the bone marrow lesion
in located in the patella.

[0069] In some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of
osteoclast activity achieves a reduction in the total area of
the bone marrow lesions of at least about 240 mm7. In some
embodiments, the reduction in total area is at least about 220
mm”, at least about 200 mm7, at least about 150 mm7’, at
least about 100 mm7’, or at least about 50 mm. In some
embodiments, the reduction in size of bone marrow lesions
represents a reduction relative to baseline of at least about
10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about
40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about
70% at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or about 100%.
In some embodiments, the reduction in area of bone marrow
lesions represents an improvement relative to placebo of at
least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at
least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at
least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at
least about 100%, at least about 120%, at least about 150%,
at least about 170%, at least about 200%, at least about
250%, at least about 300%, at least about 350%, at least
about 400%, or at least about 450%. In some embodiments,
the use of an inhibitor of osteoclast activity inhibits an
increase in the size of the bone marrow lesions over time.

[0070] Joint space narrowing (JSN) is typically graded
using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International
(OARSJ) atlas criteria, or the Kellgren and Lawrence (K/L)
system. The OARS] atlas criteria grades JSN using a 0-3
scale with Grade 0 indicating an absence of JSN, and Grades
1, 2 and 3 indicating mild, moderate, and severe JSN,
respectively (Altman and Gold, Osteoarthritis Cartilage
2007; 15(Supp! A):A1-A56). The K/L system grades JSN
using a 0-4 scale with Grade 0 indicating an absence of JSN,
Grade 1 indicating doubtful JSN, and grades 2, 3 and 4
indicating minimal, moderate, and severe JSN, respectively
(Kellgren and Lawrence, Ann Rheum Dis 1957; 16:494-
502). Based on these criteria, OARSI Grade 0 (absence of
JSN), approximates K/L Grades 0-1 (absence of, or doubtful
presence of JSN). Knee pain in a person having OARSI
Grade 0 or K/L Grade or 1 JSN in the knee where the pain
occurs may be referred to herein as a “normal joint space

SUMMARY

[0002] Bisphosphonate compounds are potent inhibitors
of osteoclast activity, and are used clinically to treat bone-
related conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget’s disease
of bone; and cancer-related conditions including multiple
myeloma, and bone metastases from solid tumors. They
generally have low oral bioavailability.

[0003] Patchy osteoporosis and bone marrow edema may
result from osteoclast hyperactivity. Zoledronic acid is a
potent inhibitor of bone resorption and osteoclast activity.
Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic
acid, also inhibit the mevalonate pathway in the osteoclast
thereby interrupting normal osteoclast function.

[0004] It has been discovered that oral dosage forms of
bisphosphonate compounds, such as zoledronic acid, can be
used to treat or alleviate pain or related conditions.

[0005] Some embodiments include a method of enhancing
the oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid comprising orally
administering a dosage form containing zoledronic acid in
the disodium salt form.

[0006] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form, wherein
the bioavailability, in a mammal, of zoledronic acid in the

disodium salt form is greater than the bioavailability of
zoledronic acid in the diacid form would be in the same
dosage form.

[0007] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in an acid or a salt form, such as the
disodium salt form, wherein the dosage form contains an
amount of zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form that
provides an area under the plasma concentration curve of
zoledronic acid of about 4 ng-h/mL to about 2000 ng-h/mL
to a human being to which the dosage form is administered.
[0008] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form, wherein
the disodium salt form is present in a lower molar amount
than would be present if the zoledronic acid were in the
diacid form; and wherein the zoledronic acid in the disodium
salt form has an improved bioavailability as compared to the
zoledronic acid in the diacid form to the extent that the lower
molar amount of the disodium salt in the dosage form does
not reduce the amount of zoledronic acid delivered to the
plasma of a mammal.

[0009] Although an oral dosage form with enhanced bio-
availability with respect to the bisphosphonate compound
can be used, the treatment can also be effective using an oral
dosage form that includes a bisphosphonate compound, such
as zoledronic acid, wherein the bioavailability of the bis-
phosphonate is unenhanced, or is substantially unenhanced.
[0010] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising administering an oral dosage
form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal in need
thereof, wherein the mammal experiences significant pain
relief more than 3 hours after administration of the dosage
form.

[0011] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
pain associated with an arthritis comprising administering an
oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a human
being in need thereof.

[0012] Some embodiments include a method of treating
complex regional pain syndrome comprising administering
an oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal
in need thereof.

[0013] Some embodiments include an oral dosage form
comprising zoledronic acid, wherein the oral bioavailability
of zoledronic acid is substantially unenhanced. For example,
in some embodiments, the oral bioavailability in the dosage
form is about 0.01% to about 4%.

[0014] Some embodiments include a pharmaceutical prod-
uct comprising more than one unit of an oral dosage form
described herein. In some embodiments, each unit of the oral
dosage form contains about 1 mg to about 50 mg of
zoledronic acid.

[0015] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising administering an oral dosage
form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal in need
thereof.

[0016] Insome embodiments, the mammal receives a total
monthly dose of zoledronic acid that is about 800 mg/m? or
less.

[0017] In some embodiments, the dosage form contains
about 10 mg/m? to about 20 mg/m? based upon the body
surface area of the mammal.

[0018] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising orally administering zole-
dronic acid to a mammal in need thereof.TABLE 3

[0281] With zoledronic acid treatment, pain was reduced

significantly as compared to placebo in patients with base-
line VAS pain intensity scores of 50 mm or greater, but not
in patients with baseline VAS scores less than 50 mm. As
shown in Table 4, average VAS scores were reduced by 9
mm as compared to placebo in the patients with baseline
VAS 250 mm, but only by 0.6 as compared to placebo in
patients with baseline VAS <50 mm.

[0282] As summarized in Table 5 and illustrated in FIG.

>50 mm, greater still in patients with OARSI Grade 0 joint
space narrowing, and greatest in patients with both baseline
VAS 250 mm and OARSI Grade 0 joint space narrowing.

[0283] BMLs were evaluated using proton density-
weighted fat saturation MR images. BMLs were scored
using Osiris software (University of Geneva, Geneva, Swit-
zerland). The maximum size was measured in mm” using
software cursors applied to the greatest area of each lesion.
The lesion with the highest score was used if more than one
was present at the same site. Each patient was given a BML
score (mm7) at each of the four sites (medial tibial, medial
femoral, lateral tibial, and lateral femoral sites) and these
were summed to create a total BML score (mm). The
change in the total area of BMLs from baseline to 6 months
was calculated.

[0284] The size of BMLs was reduced with zoledronic
acid treatment. As shown in FIG. 13 and Table 6A, average
BML area decreased by approximately 190 mm as com-
pared to placebo in the OARSI Grade 0 group, but only by
approximately 33 mm? as compared to placebo in patients
with OARSI Grades 1-2.

Methods

[0285] A study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of

a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg ZA in comparison with
intravenous placebo infusion among patients with chronic
low back pain (LBP) and Modic changes on MRI. This study
was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clini-
cal trial in patients with low back pain (LBP). Patients were
included in the study if they had low back symptoms for at
least three months, a LBP of at least six (6) on a 10-cm
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or an Oswestry Disability Index
(ODI) of at least 30%, and an M1, mixed M1/2 or M2 type
change on MRI performed within six months at most prior
to enrolment.

[0286] Patients were excluded from the study if they had
renal impairment with reduced creatinine clearance defined
as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 40
ml/min, hypocalcemia, known hypersensitivity to zole-
dronic acid or other bisphosphonates or ingredients of the
infusion product, the presence of red flags, nerve root
entrapment or willingness for early retirement. Premeno-
pausal women of childbearing potential were also excluded.
Blood samples were taken prior to the infusion to assess the
serum concentration of calcium and creatinine. The clinical
examination included medical history and clinical assess-
ment of lumbar flexibility, tendon signs, and motor and
sensory testing.

[0287] After confirmation of eligibility patients were ran-
domized to receive a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg
zoledronic acid (n=20) or 100 ml saline as placebo (n=20)
over a 15-minute period. Information on use of the con-
comitant medication and hospital admissions were recorded.
Blood samples were taken for the assessment of safety,
inflammatory mediators and markers of bone turnover at
baseline, one month and one year.

[0288] Clinical assessments were performed 14 days
before enrolment (screening visit), and follow-up visits at
one month and one year after the infusion. The primary
outcome was the change in the intensity of LBP on VAS.
Secondary outcomes included leg pain intensity, ODI,
health-related quality of life assessed with RAND-36,
patient-reported sick leaves and lumbar flexibility. These
outcome measures were assessed at baseline and at each
follow-up. Lumbar flexibility was evaluated using the fin-
gers-to-floor and trunk side bending measures (in cm). The
percentage of patients undergoing a 20% relative improve-
ment, the proportion of patients reaching a VAS score of 40
or less in the primary outcome, and patient acceptable
symptom state (PASS) were also assessed. Pain medication
use was inquired about during the follow-up visits.

Modic changes, can be classified into various types includ-
ing type 1 (M1), type 2 (M2), and type 3 (M3) lesions or
changes, any of which may be treated using an osteoclast
inhibitor, such as a nitrogen-bisphosphonate, including, e.g.
zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, etc. Different types of
Modic changes may occur in the same patient, for example
type 1 and type 2 Modic changes (M1/2). In some cases, M1
changes are related to lower back pain than other types of
Modic change.

[0120] VESCs may be found in patients with different
types of low back pain including but not limited to spon-
dylitis, trauma, spondyloarthropathies including ankylosing
spondylitis, Schmorl’s nodes, fracture, tumor, and spinal
cord infarction. Lesions in ankylosing spondylitis include
osteitis and spondylodiscitis, which can be detected using
MRI or another medical imaging instrument.

[0121] Modic changes may be found in the cervical,
thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine. Modic changes may be
found at various spinal levels such as at C1/2, C2/3, C3/4,
C4/5, C5/6, C6/7, C7/T1, T1/2, T2/3, T3/4, T4/5, T5/6, T6/7,
T7/8, T8/9, T9/10, T10/11, T11/12, T12/L1, L1/2, L2/3,
L3/4, L4/5, L5/S1, etc., any of which may be treated using
an osteoclast inhibitor, such as a nitrogen-bisphosphonate,
including, e.g. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, etc.

[0122] In some embodiments, the Modic change being
treated is located at L2/3. In some embodiments, the Modic
change being treated is located at L3/4. In some embodi-
ments, the Modic change being treated is located at L4/5. In
some embodiments, the Modic change being treated is
located at L5/S1.

[0123] In some embodiments, the Modic change being
treated is located at C3/4. In some embodiments, the Modic
change being treated is located in at C4/5. In some embodi-
ments, the Modic change being treated is located in at C5/6.
In some embodiments, the Modic change being treated is
located in at C6/7.

[0124] In some embodiments, the Modic change being
treated is located at T5/6. In some embodiments, the Modic
change being treated is located in at T6/7. In some embodi-
ments, the Modic change being treated is located in at T7/8.
In some embodiments, the Modic change being treated is
located in at T8/9. In some embodiments, the Modic change
being treated is located at T9/10.

[0125] In some embodiments, the patient being treated has
predominantly M1. In some embodiments, the patient being
treated has predominantly M1/M2. In some embodiments,
the patient being treated has predominantly M2. In some
embodiments, the patient being treated has predominantly
M3.

[0126] In some embodiments, the worst type of lesion that
the patient being treated has is M1. In some embodiments,
the worst type of lesion that the patient being treated has is
M1/2. In some embodiments, the worst type of lesion that
the patient being treated has is M2.

[0127] In some embodiments, the patient being treated has
Modic changes at more two or more levels. In some embodi-
ments the patient being treated has Modic changes at three
or more levels. In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes at two
levels, or three or more levels, than is obtained when treating
a patient with Modic changes at a single level or at two
levels.

[0128] In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes at two
levels than is obtained when treating a patient with Modic
changes at a single level.

[0129] In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes at three
or more levels than is obtained when treating a patient with
Modic changes at a single level.

[0130] In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes three
or more levels than is obtained when treating a patient with
Modic changes at two levels.

[0131] In some embodiments, the inhibitor of osteoclast
activity may be used to effect a reduction in the levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines in the patient with low back
pain or any other type of pain or condition recited herein. In
some embodiments greater pain relief may be obtained in
patients with greater baseline levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines when treated with an inhibitor of osteoclast activ-
ity, such as a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, including
e.g. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, etc. In some embodi-
ments, greater pain relief may be obtained in patients who
experience a reduction or a greater reduction in the levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines when treated with an inhibitor
of osteoclast activity, such as a nitrogen-containing bispho-
sphonate, including e.g. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid,
etc. Pro-inflammatory cytokines include but are not limited
to IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis
alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma, etc.

[0132] In some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of
osteoclast activity, such as a nitrogen-containing bisphos-
phonate, including e.g. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid,
etc., to a patient or mammal in need thereof, achieves a
reduction relative to baseline in the size of Modic changes
or VESCs of at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least
about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least
about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least
about 60%, at least about 70% at least about 80%, at least
about 90%, or about 100%. In some embodiments, the
reduction the size of Modic changes or VESCs represents an
improvement relative to placebo of at least about 10%, at
least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at
least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at
least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at
least about 90%, at least about 100%, at least about 120%,
at least about 150%, at least about 170%, at least about
200%, at least about 250%, at least about 300%, at least
about 350%, at least about 400%, or at least about 450%. In
some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity inhibits an increase in the size of Modic changes or
VESCs over time.

[0133] The oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid may be
enhanced by orally administering the zoledronic acid in the
disodium salt form. For example, the bioavailability of
zoledronic acid may be improved by at least about 10%, at
least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%,
and/or up to about 100%, or up to about 200%, as compared
to administration of zoledronic acid in the diacid form.
[0134] Because of the improved bioavailability of the
disodium salt a dosage form may contain, or a mammal,
such as a human being, may receive, on a molar basis, less
of the disodium salt form of zoledronic acid than would
otherwise be administered of the diacid form of zoledronic
acid. For example, a dosage form may contain, or a mammal% Change vs. control

FIG. 8[0260] An incapacitance device (IITC Inc. Life Science,
Woodland, Calif., USA) was used to measure hindpaw
weight bearing, a postural effect of pain. The rats were
manually held in a vertical position over the apparatus with
the hindpaws resting on separate metal scale plates and the
entire weight of the rat was supported on the hindpaws. The
duration of each measurement was 6 seconds and 10 con-
secutive measurements were taken at 60-second intervals.
Eight readings (excluding the highest and lowest ones) were
averaged to calculate the bilateral hindpaw weight-bearing
values. Weight bearing data were analyzed as the ratio
between right (fracture) and left hindpaw weight bearing
values ((2R/(R+L))x100%).

Edema Assessment

[0261] A laser sensor technique was used to determine the
dorsal-ventral thickness of the hindpaw. Before baseline
testing the bilateral hindpaws were tattooed with a 2 to 3 mm
spot on the dorsal skin over the midpoint of the third
metatarsal. For laser measurements each rat was briefly
anesthetized with isoflurane and then held vertically so the
hindpaw rested on a table top below the laser. The paw was
gently held flat on the table with a small metal rod applied
to the top of the ankle joint. Using optical triangulation, a
laser with a distance measuring sensor was used to deter-
mine the distance to the table top and to the top of the
hindpaw at the tattoo site and the difference was used to
calculate the dorsal-ventral paw thickness. The measure-
ment sensor device used in these experiments (4381 Preci-
cura, Limab, Goteborg, Sweden) has a measurement range
of 200 mm with a 0.01 mm resolution.

Hindpaw Temperature Measurement

[0262] The temperature of the hindpaw was measured
using a fine wire thermocouple (Omega, Stanford, Conn.,
USA) applied to the paw skin. Six sites were tested per
hindpaw. The six measurements for each hindpaw were
averaged for the mean temperature.

Results

[0263] As illustrated in FIG. 3, treatment with orally
administered zoledronic acid reversed pain, restored weight
bearing, and prevented edema as compared to vehicle treated
animals.

[0264] As illustrated in FIG. 4, von Frey pain thresholds
for the right (fracture) hindpaw were reduced by 72% versus
the contralateral (normal) hindpaw in vehicle treated ani-
mals. Zoledronate treatment reversed fracture induced pain
by 77% as compared to vehicle treatment.

[0265] As illustrated in FIG. 5, reduction in weight bear-
ing, a postural effect of pain, was significantly higher in the
vehicle treated group as compared to the zoledronic acid
treated group. Weight bearing on the fracture hindlimb was
reduced to 55% of normal in the vehicle treated group.
Zoledronate treatment significantly restored hindlimb
weight bearing as compared to vehicle treatment (86% of
normal).

[0266] As illustrated in FIG. 6, the expected increase in
hindpaw thickness was greater in the vehicle treated group
as compared to the zoledronic acid treated group, reflecting
the development of edema. Zoledronate treatment reduced
hindpaw edema by 60% versus vehicle treatment.

[0267] Zoledronic acid reduced hindpaw warmth by 5%
versus vehicle treatment.

[0268] The daily dose in the above experiment was 18
meg/m7/day. Under current FDA guidelines, the reference
body surface area of a human adult is 1.62 m~. Thus, a daily

dose of 18 mg/m? corresponds to a monthly dose of about
500-560 mg/m? or a human dose of about 800-900 mg.

Example 4. Solubility of Disodium Salt of
Zoledronic Acid

[0269] The aqueous solubility of zoledronic acid and
disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate was determined. One
gram of the test compound was measured in to a beaker.
Demineralized water (pH 5.5) was then added in small
increments to the test compound, and sonication was applied
to the mixture. The procedure was continued until complete
dissolution was achieved. Full dissolution was determined to
have been reached when a clear solution was present with no
visible material. The volume of water required to reach full
dissolution was used to calculate a solubility value
expressed in grams per 100 mL. The procedure was per-
formed for each compound.

Results

[0270] As shown in FIG. 7, the aqueous solubility of
disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate 1s approximately 50 times
that of zoledronic acid. Disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate
has a solubility of 12.5 g/100 mL compared to only 0.25
2/100 mL for zoledronic acid.

Example 5. Bioavailability of Orally Administered
Zoledronic Acid and Disodium Zoledronate

[0271] Tablets were manufactured containing either pure
zoledronic acid or the disodium salt of zoledronic acid
(disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate). Both types of tablets
contained 50 mg of zoledronic acid equivalent per tablet.
Identical excipients were used in both types of tablets, with
amounts adjusted to account for the difference in molecular
weights between the acid and the disodium salt.

[0272] Beagle dogs were orally administered tablets con-
taining 150 mg zoledronic acid equivalent either in the form
of disodium zoledronate (Group 1) or pure zoledronic acid
(Group 2). Each animal was given three 50 mg equivalent
tablets (150 mg total), which were administered together.
The animal’s oral cavity was wetted with water before
placing the tablets on the back of the animal’s tongue.
Animals were fasted before and after dosing. Animals were
6 to 9 months of age and weighed 6 to 10 kg on the day of
dosing. There were three dogs per group.

[0273] Serial blood samples were collected from each
animal by venipuncture of the jugular vein at various points
after dosing for measurement of plasma concentrations of
zoledronic acid. Blood samples were collected into chilled
tubes containing K,EDTA as the anticoagulant. Samples
were then centrifuged at approximately 3000 rpm at +4° C.
for 10 minutes for plasma derivation. Plasma concentrations
of zoledronic acid were measured using an LC/MS/MS
method.

[0002] Bisphosphonate compounds are potent inhibitors
of osteoclast activity, and are used clinically to treat bone-
related conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget’s disease
of bone; and cancer-related conditions including multiple
myeloma, and bone metastases from solid tumors. They
generally have low oral bioavailability.

[0003] Patchy osteoporosis and bone marrow edema may
result from osteoclast hyperactivity. Zoledronic acid is a
potent inhibitor of bone resorption and osteoclast activity.
Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic
acid, also inhibit the mevalonate pathway in the osteoclast
thereby interrupting normal osteoclast function.

[0004] It has been discovered that oral dosage forms of
bisphosphonate compounds, such as zoledronic acid, can be
used to treat or alleviate pain or related conditions.

[0005] Some embodiments include a method of enhancing
the oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid comprising orally
administering a dosage form containing zoledronic acid in
the disodium salt form.

[0006] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form, wherein
the bioavailability, in a mammal, of zoledronic acid in the

disodium salt form is greater than the bioavailability of
zoledronic acid in the diacid form would be in the same
dosage form.

[0007] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in an acid or a salt form, such as the
disodium salt form, wherein the dosage form contains an
amount of zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form that
provides an area under the plasma concentration curve of
zoledronic acid of about 4 ng-h/mL to about 2000 ng-h/mL
to a human being to which the dosage form is administered.
[0008] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form, wherein
the disodium salt form is present in a lower molar amount
than would be present if the zoledronic acid were in the
diacid form; and wherein the zoledronic acid in the disodium
salt form has an improved bioavailability as compared to the
zoledronic acid in the diacid form to the extent that the lower
molar amount of the disodium salt in the dosage form does
not reduce the amount of zoledronic acid delivered to the
plasma of a mammal.

[0009] Although an oral dosage form with enhanced bio-
availability with respect to the bisphosphonate compound
can be used, the treatment can also be effective using an oral
dosage form that includes a bisphosphonate compound, such
as zoledronic acid, wherein the bioavailability of the bis-
phosphonate is unenhanced, or is substantially unenhanced.
[0010] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising administering an oral dosage
form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal in need
thereof, wherein the mammal experiences significant pain
relief more than 3 hours after administration of the dosage
form.

[0011] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
pain associated with an arthritis comprising administering an
oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a human
being in need thereof.

[0012] Some embodiments include a method of treating
complex regional pain syndrome comprising administering
an oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal
in need thereof.

[0013] Some embodiments include an oral dosage form
comprising zoledronic acid, wherein the oral bioavailability
of zoledronic acid is substantially unenhanced. For example,
in some embodiments, the oral bioavailability in the dosage
form is about 0.01% to about 4%.

[0014] Some embodiments include a pharmaceutical prod-
uct comprising more than one unit of an oral dosage form
described herein. In some embodiments, each unit of the oral
dosage form contains about 1 mg to about 50 mg of
zoledronic acid.

[0015] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising administering an oral dosage
form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal in need
thereof.

[0016] Insome embodiments, the mammal receives a total
monthly dose of zoledronic acid that is about 800 mg/m? or
less.

[0017] In some embodiments, the dosage form contains
about 10 mg/m? to about 20 mg/m? based upon the body
surface area of the mammal.

[0018] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising orally administering zole-
dronic acid to a mammal in need thereof.TABLE 3

FIG. 1[0062] In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity can be used to treat bone marrow lesions.

[0063] In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity can be used to treat bone marrow lesions of the knee,
shoulder, ankle, wrist, hand, fingers, spine, or hip.

[0064] Commonly used measures of pain intensity include
the visual analog scale (VAS) and the numerical rating scale
(NRS). With the VAS approach, patients rate the severity of
their pain by marking a point on a 10-cm (or 100 mm) VAS
(O=no pain and 10=worst possible pain). With the NRS
approach, patients rate the severity of their pain by verbally
responding to a 10-point NRS (O=no pain and 10=worst
possible pain). VAS and NRS scores have been shown to be
strongly correlated (slope of regression line, 1.01), indicat-
ing that a score on the 10-cm VAS is equivalent to the same
score on 10-point NRS (Bijur P E et al. Acad Emerg Med
2003; 10:390-392). For example, a VAS score of 5 cm (or 50
mm) is equivalent to an NRS score of 5. Knee pain in a
person with a VAS score of 5 cm or 50 mm or higher, or an
NRS score of 5 or higher, may be referred to herein as
moderate to severe knee pain.

[0065] In some embodiments, the patient suffering from
pain, inflammation, a similar condition, or any of the con-
ditions described herein, has an NRS of 5 or greater, or a
VAS of 5 cm or greater. In some embodiments, the patient
has an NRS of 4 or greater, or a VAS of 4 cm or greater. In
some embodiments, the patient has an NRS of 6 or greater,
or a VAS of 6 cm or greater. In some embodiments, the
patient has an NRS of 7 or greater, or a VAS of 7 cm or
greater. In some embodiments, the patient has an NRS of
about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about
7, about 8, about 9, or about 10. In some embodiments, the
patient has a VAS of about 1 cm, about 2 cm, about 3 cm,
about 4 cm, about 5 cm, about 6 cm, about 7 cm, about 8 cm,
about 9 cm, or about 10 cm.

[0066] For knee pain or pain associated with bone marrow
lesions, in some embodiments, treatment with a nitrogen-
containing bisphosphonate such as zoledronic acid may
decrease the visual analog (VAS) pain score measured using
a 100 mm scale, by at least about 5 mm, at least about 8 mm,
at least about 10 mm, at least about 15 mm, up to about 50
mm, or up to about 100 mm. In some embodiments, the VAS
score, may be decreased by at least about 5 mm, at least
about 8 mm, at least about 10 mm, at least about 15 mm, up
to about 50 mm, or up to about 100 mm, as compared to a
placebo.

[0067] Treatment with a nitrogen-containing bisphospho-
nate such as zoledronic acid may decrease the numerical
rating scale (NRS) pain score measured using a 0-10 scale,
by at least about 0.1, at least about 0.5, at least about 0.8, at
least about 1, at least about 1.5, up to about 5, or up to about
10. In some embodiments, the NRS score may be decreased
by at least about 0.1, at least about 0.5, at least about 0.8, at
least about 1, at least about 1.5, up to about 5, or up to about
10, as compared to a placebo.

[0068] In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity can be used to reduce the size of bone marrow
lesions. The area of the lesions may be measured as the total
area of all lesions or as the area of any one lesion. In some
embodiments, the total area includes the medial tibial area,
the medial femoral area, the lateral tibial area, and the lateral
femoral area. In some embodiments the bone marrow lesion
in located in the patella.

[0069] In some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of
osteoclast activity achieves a reduction in the total area of
the bone marrow lesions of at least about 240 mm7. In some
embodiments, the reduction in total area is at least about 220
mm”, at least about 200 mm7, at least about 150 mm7’, at
least about 100 mm7’, or at least about 50 mm. In some
embodiments, the reduction in size of bone marrow lesions
represents a reduction relative to baseline of at least about
10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about
40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about
70% at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or about 100%.
In some embodiments, the reduction in area of bone marrow
lesions represents an improvement relative to placebo of at
least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at
least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at
least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at
least about 100%, at least about 120%, at least about 150%,
at least about 170%, at least about 200%, at least about
250%, at least about 300%, at least about 350%, at least
about 400%, or at least about 450%. In some embodiments,
the use of an inhibitor of osteoclast activity inhibits an
increase in the size of the bone marrow lesions over time.

[0070] Joint space narrowing (JSN) is typically graded
using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International
(OARSJ) atlas criteria, or the Kellgren and Lawrence (K/L)
system. The OARS] atlas criteria grades JSN using a 0-3
scale with Grade 0 indicating an absence of JSN, and Grades
1, 2 and 3 indicating mild, moderate, and severe JSN,
respectively (Altman and Gold, Osteoarthritis Cartilage
2007; 15(Supp! A):A1-A56). The K/L system grades JSN
using a 0-4 scale with Grade 0 indicating an absence of JSN,
Grade 1 indicating doubtful JSN, and grades 2, 3 and 4
indicating minimal, moderate, and severe JSN, respectively
(Kellgren and Lawrence, Ann Rheum Dis 1957; 16:494-
502). Based on these criteria, OARSI Grade 0 (absence of
JSN), approximates K/L Grades 0-1 (absence of, or doubtful
presence of JSN). Knee pain in a person having OARSI
Grade 0 or K/L Grade or 1 JSN in the knee where the pain
occurs may be referred to herein as a “normal joint space
knee pain.”

[0071] In some embodiments for patients having OARSI
Grade 0 or K/L Grades 0-1 JSN, the use of an inhibitor of
osteoclast activity achieves a reduction in the total area of
the bone marrow lesions of at least about 240 mm7?. In some
embodiments, the reduction in total area is at least about 220
mm7’, at least about 200 mm”, at least about 150 mm”, at
least about 100 mm/?, or at least about 50 mm. In some
embodiments, the reduction in size of bone marrow lesions
represents a reduction relative to baseline of at least about
10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about
25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about
40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about
60%, at least about 70% at least about 80%, at least about
90%, or about 100%. In some embodiments, the reduction in
area of bone marrow lesions represents an improvement
relative to placebo of at least about 10%, at least about 20%,
at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%,
at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%,
at least about 90%, at least about 100%, at least about 120%,
at least about 150%, at least about 170%, at least about
200%, at least about 250%, at least about 300%, at least
about 350%, at least about 400%, or at least about 450%. InDOSAGE FORMS FOR ORAL

SUMMARY

[0002] Bisphosphonate compounds are potent inhibitors
of osteoclast activity, and are used clinically to treat bone-
related conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget’s disease
of bone; and cancer-related conditions including multiple
myeloma, and bone metastases from solid tumors. They
generally have low oral bioavailability.

[0003] Patchy osteoporosis and bone marrow edema may
result from osteoclast hyperactivity. Zoledronic acid is a
potent inhibitor of bone resorption and osteoclast activity.
Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic
acid, also inhibit the mevalonate pathway in the osteoclast
thereby interrupting normal osteoclast function.

[0004] It has been discovered that oral dosage forms of
bisphosphonate compounds, such as zoledronic acid, can be
used to treat or alleviate pain or related conditions.

[0005] Some embodiments include a method of enhancing
the oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid comprising orally
administering a dosage form containing zoledronic acid in
the disodium salt form.

[0006] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form, wherein
the bioavailability, in a mammal, of zoledronic acid in the

disodium salt form is greater than the bioavailability of
zoledronic acid in the diacid form would be in the same
dosage form.

[0007] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in an acid or a salt form, such as the
disodium salt form, wherein the dosage form contains an
amount of zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form that
provides an area under the plasma concentration curve of
zoledronic acid of about 4 ng-h/mL to about 2000 ng-h/mL
to a human being to which the dosage form is administered.
[0008] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form, wherein
the disodium salt form is present in a lower molar amount
than would be present if the zoledronic acid were in the
diacid form; and wherein the zoledronic acid in the disodium
salt form has an improved bioavailability as compared to the
zoledronic acid in the diacid form to the extent that the lower
molar amount of the disodium salt in the dosage form does
not reduce the amount of zoledronic acid delivered to the
plasma of a mammal.

[0009] Although an oral dosage form with enhanced bio-
availability with respect to the bisphosphonate compound
can be used, the treatment can also be effective using an oral
dosage form that includes a bisphosphonate compound, such
as zoledronic acid, wherein the bioavailability of the bis-
phosphonate is unenhanced, or is substantially unenhanced.
[0010] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising administering an oral dosage
form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal in need
thereof, wherein the mammal experiences significant pain
relief more than 3 hours after administration of the dosage
form.

[0011] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
pain associated with an arthritis comprising administering an
oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a human
being in need thereof.

[0012] Some embodiments include a method of treating
complex regional pain syndrome comprising administering
an oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal
in need thereof.

[0013] Some embodiments include an oral dosage form
comprising zoledronic acid, wherein the oral bioavailability
of zoledronic acid is substantially unenhanced. For example,
in some embodiments, the oral bioavailability in the dosage
form is about 0.01% to about 4%.

[0014] Some embodiments include a pharmaceutical prod-
uct comprising more than one unit of an oral dosage form
described herein. In some embodiments, each unit of the oral
dosage form contains about 1 mg to about 50 mg of
zoledronic acid.

[0015] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising administering an oral dosage
form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal in need
thereof.

[0016] Insome embodiments, the mammal receives a total
monthly dose of zoledronic acid that is about 800 mg/m? or
less.

[0017] In some embodiments, the dosage form contains
about 10 mg/m? to about 20 mg/m? based upon the body
surface area of the mammal.

[0018] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inflammatory pain comprising orally administering zole-
dronic acid to a mammal in need thereof.TABLE 3

[0281] With zoledronic acid treatment, pain was reduced

significantly as compared to placebo in patients with base-
line VAS pain intensity scores of 50 mm or greater, but not
in patients with baseline VAS scores less than 50 mm. As
shown in Table 4, average VAS scores were reduced by 9
mm as compared to placebo in the patients with baseline
VAS 250 mm, but only by 0.6 as compared to placebo in
patients with baseline VAS <50 mm.

>50 mm, greater still in patients with OARSI Grade 0 joint
space narrowing, and greatest in patients with both baseline
VAS 250 mm and OARSI Grade 0 joint space narrowing.

[0283] BMLs were evaluated using proton density-
weighted fat saturation MR images. BMLs were scored
using Osiris software (University of Geneva, Geneva, Swit-
zerland). The maximum size was measured in mm” using
software cursors applied to the greatest area of each lesion.
The lesion with the highest score was used if more than one
was present at the same site. Each patient was given a BML
score (mm7) at each of the four sites (medial tibial, medial
femoral, lateral tibial, and lateral femoral sites) and these
were summed to create a total BML score (mm). The
change in the total area of BMLs from baseline to 6 months
was calculated.

[0284] The size of BMLs was reduced with zoledronic
acid treatment. As shown in FIG. 13 and Table 6A, average
BML area decreased by approximately 190 mm as com-
pared to placebo in the OARSI Grade 0 group, but only by
approximately 33 mm? as compared to placebo in patients
with OARSI Grades 1-2.

Methods

[0285] A study was performed to evaluate the efficacy of

a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg ZA in comparison with
intravenous placebo infusion among patients with chronic
low back pain (LBP) and Modic changes on MRI. This study
was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clini-
cal trial in patients with low back pain (LBP). Patients were
included in the study if they had low back symptoms for at
least three months, a LBP of at least six (6) on a 10-cm
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or an Oswestry Disability Index
(ODI) of at least 30%, and an M1, mixed M1/2 or M2 type
change on MRI performed within six months at most prior
to enrolment.

[0286] Patients were excluded from the study if they had
renal impairment with reduced creatinine clearance defined
as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 40
ml/min, hypocalcemia, known hypersensitivity to zole-
dronic acid or other bisphosphonates or ingredients of the
infusion product, the presence of red flags, nerve root
entrapment or willingness for early retirement. Premeno-
pausal women of childbearing potential were also excluded.
Blood samples were taken prior to the infusion to assess the
serum concentration of calcium and creatinine. The clinical
examination included medical history and clinical assess-
ment of lumbar flexibility, tendon signs, and motor and
sensory testing.

[0287] After confirmation of eligibility patients were ran-
domized to receive a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg
zoledronic acid (n=20) or 100 ml saline as placebo (n=20)
over a 15-minute period. Information on use of the con-
comitant medication and hospital admissions were recorded.
Blood samples were taken for the assessment of safety,
inflammatory mediators and markers of bone turnover at
baseline, one month and one year.

[0288] Clinical assessments were performed 14 days
before enrolment (screening visit), and follow-up visits at
one month and one year after the infusion. The primary
outcome was the change in the intensity of LBP on VAS.
Secondary outcomes included leg pain intensity, ODI,
health-related quality of life assessed with RAND-36,
patient-reported sick leaves and lumbar flexibility. These
outcome measures were assessed at baseline and at each
follow-up. Lumbar flexibility was evaluated using the fin-
gers-to-floor and trunk side bending measures (in cm). The
percentage of patients undergoing a 20% relative improve-
ment, the proportion of patients reaching a VAS score of 40
or less in the primary outcome, and patient acceptable
symptom state (PASS) were also assessed. Pain medication
use was inquired about during the follow-up visits.

Embodiment 412

[0741] The method, composition, molecular complex,
dosage form, or product, of any preceding embodiment,
wherein zoledronic acid or neridronic acid decreases CTX
serum levels by at least about 75%.referred to as vertebral endplate signal changes (VESC).
Modic changes, can be classified into various types includ-
ing type 1 (M1), type 2 (M2), and type 3 (M3) lesions or
changes, any of which may be treated using an osteoclast
inhibitor, such as a nitrogen-bisphosphonate, including, e.g.
zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, etc. Different types of
Modic changes may occur in the same patient, for example
type 1 and type 2 Modic changes (M1/2). In some cases, M1
changes are related to lower back pain than other types of
Modic change.

[0120] VESCs may be found in patients with different
types of low back pain including but not limited to spon-
dylitis, trauma, spondyloarthropathies including ankylosing
spondylitis, Schmorl’s nodes, fracture, tumor, and spinal
cord infarction. Lesions in ankylosing spondylitis include
osteitis and spondylodiscitis, which can be detected using
MRI or another medical imaging instrument.

[0121] Modic changes may be found in the cervical,
thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine. Modic changes may be
found at various spinal levels such as at C1/2, C2/3, C3/4,
C4/5, C5/6, C6/7, C7/T1, T1/2, T2/3, T3/4, T4/5, T5/6, T6/7,
T7/8, T8/9, T9/10, T10/11, T11/12, T12/L1, L1/2, L2/3,
L3/4, L4/5, L5/S1, etc., any of which may be treated using
an osteoclast inhibitor, such as a nitrogen-bisphosphonate,
including, e.g. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, etc.

[0122] In some embodiments, the Modic change being
treated is located at L2/3. In some embodiments, the Modic
change being treated is located at L3/4. In some embodi-
ments, the Modic change being treated is located at L4/5. In
some embodiments, the Modic change being treated is
located at L5/S1.

[0123] In some embodiments, the Modic change being
treated is located at C3/4. In some embodiments, the Modic
change being treated is located in at C4/5. In some embodi-
ments, the Modic change being treated is located in at C5/6.
In some embodiments, the Modic change being treated is
located in at C6/7.

[0124] In some embodiments, the Modic change being
treated is located at T5/6. In some embodiments, the Modic
change being treated is located in at T6/7. In some embodi-
ments, the Modic change being treated is located in at T7/8.
In some embodiments, the Modic change being treated is
located in at T8/9. In some embodiments, the Modic change
being treated is located at T9/10.

[0125] In some embodiments, the patient being treated has
predominantly M1. In some embodiments, the patient being
treated has predominantly M1/M2. In some embodiments,
the patient being treated has predominantly M2. In some
embodiments, the patient being treated has predominantly
M3.

[0126] In some embodiments, the worst type of lesion that
the patient being treated has is M1. In some embodiments,
the worst type of lesion that the patient being treated has is
M1/2. In some embodiments, the worst type of lesion that
the patient being treated has is M2.

[0127] In some embodiments, the patient being treated has
Modic changes at more two or more levels. In some embodi-
ments the patient being treated has Modic changes at three
or more levels. In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes at two
levels, or three or more levels, than is obtained when treating
a patient with Modic changes at a single level or at two
levels.

[0128] In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes at two
levels than is obtained when treating a patient with Modic
changes at a single level.

[0129] In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes at three
or more levels than is obtained when treating a patient with
Modic changes at a single level.

[0130] In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes three
or more levels than is obtained when treating a patient with
Modic changes at two levels.

[0131] In some embodiments, the inhibitor of osteoclast
activity may be used to effect a reduction in the levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines in the patient with low back
pain or any other type of pain or condition recited herein. In
some embodiments greater pain relief may be obtained in
patients with greater baseline levels of pro-inflammatory
cytokines when treated with an inhibitor of osteoclast activ-
ity, such as a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, including
e.g. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, etc. In some embodi-
ments, greater pain relief may be obtained in patients who
experience a reduction or a greater reduction in the levels of
pro-inflammatory cytokines when treated with an inhibitor
of osteoclast activity, such as a nitrogen-containing bispho-
sphonate, including e.g. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid,
etc. Pro-inflammatory cytokines include but are not limited
to IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-12, tumor necrosis
alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gamma, etc.

[0132] In some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of
osteoclast activity, such as a nitrogen-containing bisphos-
phonate, including e.g. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid,
etc., to a patient or mammal in need thereof, achieves a
reduction relative to baseline in the size of Modic changes
or VESCs of at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least
about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least
about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least
about 60%, at least about 70% at least about 80%, at least
about 90%, or about 100%. In some embodiments, the
reduction the size of Modic changes or VESCs represents an
improvement relative to placebo of at least about 10%, at
least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at
least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at
least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at
least about 90%, at least about 100%, at least about 120%,
at least about 150%, at least about 170%, at least about
200%, at least about 250%, at least about 300%, at least
about 350%, at least about 400%, or at least about 450%. In
some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity inhibits an increase in the size of Modic changes or
VESCs over time.

[0133] The oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid may be
enhanced by orally administering the zoledronic acid in the
disodium salt form. For example, the bioavailability of
zoledronic acid may be improved by at least about 10%, at
least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%,
and/or up to about 100%, or up to about 200%, as compared
to administration of zoledronic acid in the diacid form.
[0134] Because of the improved bioavailability of the
disodium salt a dosage form may contain, or a mammal,
such as a human being, may receive, on a molar basis, less
of the disodium salt form of zoledronic acid than would
otherwise be administered of the diacid form of zoledronic
acid. For example, a dosage form may contain, or a mammal% Change vs. control

","CROSS-REFERENCE This application is a continuation of PCT Application PCT/CN2017/081446, filed Apr. 21, 2017, which claims the benefit of CN patent application number CN201610256568.9 filed on Apr. 22, 2016, the content of which is incorporated herein in its entirety. BACKGROUND Cancer has a major impact on society in across the globe. In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States alone, and 595,690 people will die from the disease. By 2020, 18.2 million Americans, roughly 1 in 19 people, will be cancer patients or cancer survivors, up from 11.7 million (1 in 26) in 2005, according to the Journal of Oncology Practice (Erikson 2007). Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are recombinant receptors for antigen, which, in a single molecule, redirect the specificity and function of T cells and other immune cells. Their use in cancer immunotherapy can be to rapidly generate tumor-targeted T cells, bypassing the obstacles of active immunization. Once expressed in cells, the CAR-modified cell may exert both immediate and long-term effects in a subject. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, which edits a cancer patient's T cells to recognize their tumors, has shown to be effective for treating blood cancers. In recent clinical trials, CAR T cell therapy has dramatically improved the outcomes of blood cancer patients with advanced, otherwise untreatable forms of leukemia and lymphoma. In contract, CAR T cells face a unique set of challenges in the context of solid tumors. Amongst the challenges include the identification of an antigen whose expression clearly demarcates tumor from normal tissue and establishing effective killing of tumor cells within a tumor and hence reduction of tumor size. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION There exists a pressing need for alternative and effective treatment for a wide variety of solid tumors. The present invention addresses this need and provides related advantages as well. Accordingly, the present invention discloses a method of treating a subject exhibiting a solid tumor that can express Glypican-3 (GPC3).

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE The following description and examples illustrate embodiments of the disclosure in detail. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein and as such can vary. Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are numerous variations and modifications of the disclosure, which are encompassed within its scope. Unless otherwise indicated, any embodiment can be combined with any other embodiment. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, some inventive embodiments herein contemplate numerical ranges. A variety of aspects of this invention can be presented in a range format. It should be understood that the description in range format is merely for convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an inflexible limitation on the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the description of a range should be considered to have specifically disclosed all the possible subranges as well as individual numerical values within that range as if explicitly written out. For example, description of a range such as from 1 to 6 should be considered to have specifically disclosed subranges such as from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 5, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 6, from 3 to 6 etc., as well as individual numbers within that range, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This applies regardless of the breadth of the range. When ranges are present, the ranges include the range endpoints. Definitions As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, the article “a” means one or more unless explicitly otherwise provided for. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, terms such as “contain,” “containing,” “include,” “including,” and the like mean “comprising”. The term “activation” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a process whereby a cell transitions from a resting state to an active state. This process can comprise a response to an antigen, migration, and/or a phenotypic or genetic change to a functionally active state. For example, the term “activation” can refer to the stepwise process of T cell activation. For example, a T cell can require at least two signals to become fully activated. The first signal can occur after engagement of a TCR by the antigen-MHC complex, and the second signal can occur by engagement of co-stimulatory molecules (Table 3). Anti-CD3 can mimic the first signal and anti-CD28 can mimic the second signal in vitro. For example, an engineered T cell can be activated by an expressed CAR. T cell activation” or T cell triggering, as used herein, can refer to the state of a T cell that has been sufficiently stimulated to induce detectable cellular proliferation, cytokine production and/or detectable effector function. The term “antigen binding unit” as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin molecule and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen-binding site which specifically binds (“immunoreacts with”) an antigen. Also encompassed within the term “antigen binding unit” are immunoglobulin molecules of a variety of species origins including invertebrates and vertebrates. Structurally, the simplest naturally occurring antibody (e.g., IgG) comprises four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. The immunoglobulins represent a large family of molecules that include several types of molecules, such as IgD, IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE. The term “immunoglobulin molecule” includes, for example, hybrid antibodies, or altered antibodies, and fragments thereof. It has been shown that the antigen binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a naturally-occurring antibody. These fragments are collectively termed “antigen-binding units”. Also encompassed within the term “antigen binding unit” is any polypeptide chain-containing molecular structure that has a specific shape which fits to and recognizes an epitope, where one or more non-covalent binding interactions stabilize the complex between the molecular structure and the epitope. An antigen binding unit “specifically binds to” or “immunoreactive with” an antigen if it binds with greater affinity or avidity than it binds to other reference antigens including polypeptides or other substances. “Antigen” as used herein means a substance that is recognized and bound specifically by an antigen binding unit. Antigens can include peptides, proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, and lipids; portions thereof and combinations thereof. Non-limiting exemplary antigen included GPC3 from human, murine, and other homologues thereof. “Antigen” can also refer to a molecule that provokes the immune response. This immune response may involve either antibody production, or the activation of specific immunologically-competent cells, or both. The skilled artisan will understand that any macromolecule, including virtually all proteins or peptides, can serve as an antigen. The term “immunoglobulin” or “Ig”, as used herein can refer to a class of proteins, which function as antibodies. Antibodies expressed by B cells are sometimes referred to as the chimeric antigen receptor or antigen receptor. The five members included in this class of proteins are IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgE, of which IgG is the most common circulating antibody. It is the most efficient immunoglobulin in agglutination, complement fixation, and other antibody responses, and is important in defense against bacteria and viruses. For example, a tumor cell antigen can be recognized by a CAR. The term “anti-GPC3 antibody” can refer to an antibody or antibody binding site that is capable of binding GPC3 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful for distinguishing GPC3 from other antigens expressed by a cell. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti-GPC3 antibody to an unrelated, non-GPC3 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to GPC3 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to GPC3 can have a dissociation constant (Kd) of <1 μM, <100 nM, <10 nM, <5 nM, <4 nM, <3 nM, <2 nM, <1 nM, <0.1 nM, <0.01 nM, or <0.001 nM (e.g., 10−8M or less, e.g. from 10−8 M to 10−13 M, e.g., from 10−9M to 10−13 M). In certain embodiments, an anti-GPC3 antibody binds to an epitope of GPC3 that is conserved among GPC3 from different species. The term “autologous” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to as originating from the same being. For example, a sample (e.g., cells) can be removed, processed, and given back to the same subject (e.g., patient) at a later time. An autologous process is distinguished from an allogenic process where the donor and the recipient are different subjects. “Xenotransplantation” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can encompass any procedure that involves transplantation, implantation, or infusion of cells, tissues, or organs into a recipient, where the recipient and donor are different species. Transplantation of the cells, organs, and/or tissues described herein can be used for xenotransplantation in into humans. Xenotransplantation includes but is not limited to vascularized xenotransplant, partially vascularized xenotransplant, unvascularized xenotransplant, xenodressings, xenobandages, and xenostructures. “Allotransplantation” and its grammatical equivalents (e.g., allogenic transplantation) as used herein can encompass any procedure that involves transplantation, implantation, or infusion of cells, tissues, or organs into a recipient, where the recipient and donor are the same species but different individuals. Transplantation of the cells, organs, and/or tissues described herein can be used for allotransplantation into humans. Allotransplantation includes but is not limited to vascularized allotransplant, partially vascularized allotransplant, unvascularized allotransplant, allodressings, allobandages, and allostructures. “Autotransplantation” and its grammatical equivalents (e.g., autologous transplantation) as used herein can encompass any procedure that involves transplantation, implantation, or infusion of cells, tissues, or organs into a recipient, where the recipient and donor is the same individual. Transplantation of the cells, organs, and/or tissues described herein can be used for autotransplantation into humans. Autotransplantation includes but is not limited to vascularized autotransplantation, partially vascularized autotransplantation, unvascularized autotransplantation, autodressings, autobandages, and autostructures. The term “chimeric antigen receptor” or “CAR” as used herein refers to an engineered molecule, which can be expressed by an immune cell including but not limited to T cells. CAR when expressed in T cells and can redirect T cells to induce killing of a target cell with a specificity dictated by the artificial receptor. The CAR's extracellular binding domain can be derived from a murine, humanized, or fully human monoclonal antibody. An “anti-GPC3-CAR” is a CAR that is capable of binding to GPC3. The term “epitope” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a part of an antigen that can be recognized by antibodies, B cells, T cells or engineered cells. For example, an epitope can be a cancer epitope that is recognized by a TCR. Multiple epitopes within an antigen can also be recognized. The epitope can also be mutated. The term “engineered” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to one or more alterations of a nucleic acid, e.g., the nucleic acid within an organism's genome. The term “engineered” can refer to alterations, additions, and/or deletion of genes. An engineered cell can also refer to a cell with an added, deleted and/or altered gene. The term “cell” or “engineered cell” and their grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a cell of human or non-human animal origin. An engineered cell can also refer to a CAR-expressing cell. The term “good manufacturing practices” (GMP) and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to products that are safe, effective, or pure according to the FDA. GMP can also sometimes be referred to as “cGMP”. The “c” stands for “current.” Manufacturers of a product can employ technologies and systems which are up-to-date in order to comply with regulation of GMP products. GMP compatible products are typically utilized in the clinical setting as opposed to the research setting. The term “transfection” as used herein refers to the introduction of foreign nucleic acid into eukaryotic cells. Transfection may be accomplished by a variety of means known to the art including calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, polybrene-mediated transfection, electroporation, microinjection, liposome fusion, lipofection, protoplast fusion, retroviral infection, and biolistics. The term “stable transfection” or “stably transfected” refers to the introduction and integration of foreign nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, into the genome of the transfected cell. The term “stable transfectant” refers to a cell which has stably integrated foreign DNA into the genomic DNA. As used herein, the terms “nucleic acid molecule encoding,” “DNA sequence encoding,” and “DNA encoding” refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The nucleic acid sequence thus codes for the amino acid sequence. The term “subject”, as used herein, refers to any animal, e.g., a mammal or marsupial. Subjects of the present invention include but are not limited to humans, non-human primates (e.g., rhesus or other types of macaques), mice, pigs, horses, donkeys, cows, sheep, rats and fowl of any kind. The term “recipient” and their grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a human or non-human animal in receipt of a therapy or treatment. The term “peripheral blood lymphocytes” (PBL) and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to lymphocytes that circulate in the blood (e.g., peripheral blood). Peripheral blood lymphocytes can refer to lymphocytes that are not localized to organs. Peripheral blood lymphocytes can comprise T cells, NK cells, B cell, or any combinations thereof. The term “immunoresponsive cell” can refer to a cell that can elicit an immune response, including but not limited to T cells, B cells, and NKT cells, their respective precursor cells and progeny thereof. An immunoresponsive cell can also refer to a cell of a lymphoid or myeloid lineage. The term “T cell” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a T cell from any origin. For example, a T cell can be a primary T cell, e.g., an autologous T cell, a cell line, etc. The T cell can also be human or non-human. The term “T cell activation” or “T cell triggering” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to the state of a T cell that has been sufficiently stimulated to induce detectable cellular proliferation, cytokine production and/or detectable effector function. In some cases, “full T cell activation” can be similar to triggering T cell cytotoxicity. T cell activation can be measured using various assays known in the art. Said assays can be an ELISA to measure cytokine secretion, an ELISPOT, flow cytometry assays to measure intracellular cytokine expression (CD107), flow cytometry assays to measure proliferation, and cytotoxicity assays (51Cr release assay) to determine target cell elimination. Said assays typically use controls (non-engineered cells) to compare to engineered cells (CAR T) to determine relative activation of an engineered cell compared to a control. Additionally, said assays can compare engineered cells incubated or put in contact with a target cell not expressing the target antigen. For example, said comparison can be a CD19-CAR T cell incubated with a target cell that does not express CD19. The term “sequence” and its grammatical equivalents when used to refer to a nucleotide sequence, can encompass DNA or RNA; and can be either single-stranded or double stranded. A nucleic acid sequence can be mutated. A nucleic acid sequence can be of any length, for example, between 2 and 1,000,000 or more nucleotides in length (or any integer value there between or there above), e.g., between about 100 and about 10,000 nucleotides or between about 200 and about 500 nucleotides. Methods of Use In one aspect, disclosed herein are methods of treating a subject exhibiting a solid tumor that expresses Glypican-3 (GPC3). A subject method typically comprises the step of administering anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor immunoresponsive cells to a subject, wherein the administering takes place after or concurrent with subjecting the subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment. Subjects treated by methods disclosed herein can exhibit a cancer or a solid tumor. Often, cancer cells or solid tumor cells express one or more tumor antigens. Typically, the tumor antigen is Glypican-3 (GPC3). A subject exhibiting a cancer or solid tumor expressing GPC-3 can be referred to as exhibiting a GPC3-positive cancer. Cancers that express GPC3 include but are not limited to liver cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, liposarcoma, testicular noneminomatous germ cell cancer, melanoma, adenoma, adrenal cancer, schwannoma, malignant, fibrous histiochytoma, or any combination thereof. The subject methods are applicable for treating squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma of a GI tract, or any other cancer disclosed in “Glypican-3 expression in gastrointestinal and pancreatic epithelial neoplasms. (2013) 44, 542-550 Human Pathology.” Additionally immunoresponsive cells disclosed herein, such as an anti-GPC3-CAR-T disclosed herein, can be utilized to target ovarian carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, mesothelioma, breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the lunch, cervical intraethithelial neoplasia, squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, oncocytoma, papillary carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, papillary carcinoma, and lobular and medullary carcinoma of the breast. Additional targets for anti-GPC3 therapy can include those found in, “Glypican 3 expression in human nonneoplastic, preneoplastic, and neoplastic tissues. (2008) 129:899-906 Am J ClinPathol.” In some cases, a cancer or tumor cell can be evaluated for GPC3 expression by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. A level of GPC3 on a cancer or tumor cell can be classified as low, medium, or high. In some cases, a cancer or tumor cell can express GPC3 on the cell surface. Expression of GPC3 on a cell surface can be determined, for example, using antibodies to GPC3 in a method such as immunohistochemistry or flow cytometric analysis. Alternatively, GPC3 mRNA expression can be considered to correlate to GPC3 expression on a cell surface and can be determined by a method selected from in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. In some cases, GPC3 is encoded by a gene comprising the nucleic acid sequence exhibiting at least 50% sequence identity to the referenced gene in Table 2. GPC3 can be encoded by a gene comprising the nucleic acid sequence exhibiting at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% sequence identity to the referenced gene in Table 2. In some embodiments, anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor immunoresponsive cells are administered to a subject exhibiting a solid tumor expressing GPC3 after or concurrent with subjecting the subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment. A subject anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) typically comprises an extracellular antigen binding region, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling region that controls immunoresponsive cell activation. In some cases, the anti-GPC3 CAR further comprises a hinge or spacer. In some cases, the anti-GPC3 CAR further comprises one or more co-stimulatory domains. A chimeric antigen receptor typically comprises an extracellular antigen binding region. In one embodiment, the extracellular antigen binding region can be fully human. In other cases, the extracellular antigen binding region can be humanized. In other cases, the extracellular antigen binding region can be murine or a chimeric in the extracellular antigen binding region is composed of amino acid sequences derived from at least two different animal species. In some cases, the extracellular antigen binding region can be non-human. A variety of antigen binding regions can be designed to target GPC3. Non-limiting examples include single-chain variable fragments (scFv's) derived from antibodies, fragment antigen binding region (Fab) selected from libraries, single domain fragment, or nature ligands that engage their cognate receptor. An extracellular antigen binding region can encompass a scFv, a Fab, or a nature ligand, as well as any of their derivatives. An extracellular antigen binding region can refer to a molecule other than an intact antibody that can comprise a portion of an intact antibody and that can bind an antigen to which an intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments can include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab′, Fab′-SH, F (ab′) 2; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g. scFv); and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. An extracellular antigen binding region, for example the scFv, Fab, or natural ligand, can be a portion of a CAR that determines antigen specificity. An extracellular antigen binding region can bind to any complementary target. An extracellular antigen binding region can be derived from an antibody for which sequences of a variable region are known. An extracellular antigen binding region can be derived from an antibody sequence obtained from an available mouse hybridoma. Alternatively, an extracellular antigen binding region can be obtained from whole-exomic sequencing of a tumor cell or primary cell, such as a tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL). In some cases, binding specificity of an extracellular antigen binding region can be determined by complementarity determining regions, or CDRs, such as light chain CDRs or heavy chain CDRs. In many cases, binding specificity can be determined by light chain CDRs and heavy chain CDRs. A given combination of heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDRs can provide a given binding pocket that can confer a greater affinity and/or specificity towards an antigen, such as GPC3, as compared to other reference antigens. For example, a CDR specific to glypican-3 can be expressed in an extracellular binding region of a CAR such that the CAR targeting the GPC3 can target the immunoresponsive cell to a tumor cell expressing GPC3. In some aspects of any of the embodiments disclosed herein, an extracellular antigen binding region, such as a scFv, can comprise a light chain CDR specific for GPC3. A light chain CDR can be a complementarity determining region of a light chain of an antigen binding unit, such as a scFv of a CAR. A light chain CDR can comprise a continuous sequence of amino acid residues, or two or more contiguous sequences of amino acid residues separated by, and optionally flanked by, non-complementarity determining regions, such as framework regions. In some cases, a light chain CDR can comprise two or more light chain CDRs, which can be referred to as light chain CDR-1, CDR-2, and so on. In some cases, a light chain CDR can comprise three light chain CDRs, which can be referred to as light chain CDR-1, light chain CDR-2, and light chain CDR-3 respectively. In some examples, a group of CDRs present on a common light chain can collectively be referred to as light chain CDRs. In some aspects of any of the embodiments disclosed herein, extracellular antigen binding region, such as a scFv, can comprise a heavy chain CDR specific for GPC3. A heavy chain CDR can be a complementarity determining region of a heavy chain of an antigen binding unit such as a scFv. A heavy chain CDR can comprise a continuous sequence of amino acid residues, or two or more contiguous sequences of amino acid residues separated by, and optionally flanked by, non-complementarity determining regions, such as framework regions. In some cases, a heavy chain CDR can comprise two or more heavy chain CDRs, which can be referred to as heavy chain CDR-1, CDR-2, and so on. In some cases, a heavy chain CDR can comprise three heavy chain CDRs, which can be referred to as heavy chain CDR-1, heavy chain CDR-2, and heavy chain CDR-3 respectively. In some cases, a group of CDRs present on a common heavy chain can collectively be referred to as heavy chain CDRs. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region targeting GPC3 can be expressed by an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell. In some cases, CDRs, light chain and/or heavy chain that bind a GPC3 antigen can be comprised within an extracellular antigen binding region of a CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as CAR T cells. In some cases, modified anti-GPC3 CDRs can be expressed on an extracellular antigen binding region of a CAR immunoresponsive cell and have from about 50% homology to about 100% homology to original anti-GPC3 CDRs. In some cases, a modified anti-GPC3 CDR can comprise from about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% homology to an unmodified anti-GPC3 CDR. In some cases, a scFv targeting GPC3 can be expressed by an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell. In some cases, CDRs, light chain and/or heavy chain that bind a GPC3 antigen can be expressed on a scFv of a CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as CAR T cells. In some cases, modified anti-GPC3 CDRs can be expressed on a scFv of a CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as CAR T cells, and have from about 50% homology to about 100% homology to original anti-GPC3 CDRs. In some cases, a modified anti-GPC3 CDR can comprise from about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% homology to an unmodified anti-GPC3 CDR.

 In preferred cases, an extracellular antigen binding region specifically recognizes GPC3. GPC3 can comprise a sequence exhibition at least 80% identical to a referenced GPC3 gene in Table 2. In some cases, extracellular antigen binding region can target an N-terminus, a C-terminus, or any portion from an N-terminus to a C-terminus of GPC3. A C-terminus of a GPC3 can be attached to a cell membrane covalently via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. A C-terminus can comprise from about 1 to about 800 bases in some cases. A C-terminus can comprise from about 1, 50, 100, 150, 300, 500, 600 up to about 800 bases from a C-terminal end. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region can target the GPI anchor of GPC3.

 By employing genetic engineering, an extracellular antigen binding region may be modified in a variety of ways. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region can be mutated, so that the extracellular antigen binding region may be selected for higher affinity to its target. In some cases, the affinity of the extracellular antigen binding region for its target can be optimized for targets that can be expressed at low levels on normal tissues. This optimization can be performed to minimize potential toxicities. In other cases, the cloning of an extracellular antigen binding region that has a higher affinity for the membrane bound form of a target can be preferable over its soluble form counterpart. This modification can be performed because some targets can also be detected in soluble form at different levels and their targeting can cause unintended toxicity. In some cases, a extracellular antigen binding region can be from about 50% to about 100% similar in homology to any one of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, or SEQ ID NO: 8. In some cases, a extracellular antigen binding region can comprise about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% homology to SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, or SEQ ID NO: 8. In some cases, extracellular antigen binding region can be murine, humanized, or fully human. An extracellular antigen binding region can be from about 1% to about 100% human. In some cases, a extracellular antigen binding region can be from about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or up to about 100% human. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region comprises a hinge or spacer. The terms hinge and spacer can be used interchangeably. A hinge can be considered a portion of a CAR used to provide flexibility to an extracellular antigen binding region. In some cases, a hinge can be used to detect a CAR on the cell surface of a cell, particularly when antibodies to detect the extracellular antigen binding region are not functional or available. For instance the length of the hinge derived from an immunoglobulin may require optimization depending on the location of the epitope on the target that the extracellular antigen binding region is targeting. In some cases, a hinge may not belong to an immunoglobulin but instead to another molecule such the native hinge of a CD8 alpha molecule. A CD8 alpha hinge can contain cysteine and proline residues known to play a role in the interaction of a CD8 co-receptor and MHC molecule. Said cysteine and proline residues can influence the performance of said CAR. A CAR hinge can be size tunable and can compensate to some extent in normalizing the orthogonal synapse distance between CAR immunoresponsive cell and a target cell. This topography of the immunological synapse between an immunoresponsive cell and a target cell also defines a distance that cannot be functionally bridged by a CAR due to a membrane-distal epitope on a cell-surface target molecule that, even with a short hinge CAR, cannot bring the synapse distance in to an approximation for signaling. Likewise, membrane-proximal CAR target antigen epitopes have been described for which signaling outputs are only observed in the context of a long hinge CAR. A hinge can be tuned according to the extracellular antigen binding region that is used. A hinge can be of any length. A transmembrane domain can anchor a CAR to the plasma membrane of a cell. A native transmembrane portion of CD28 can be used in a CAR. In other cases, a native transmembrane portion of CD8 alpha can also be used in the CAR. By “CD8” it can be meant a protein having at least 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identity to NCBI Reference No: NP_001759 or a fragment thereof that has stimulatory activity. By “CD8 nucleic acid molecule” it can be meant a polynucleotide encoding a CD8 polypeptide. In some cases, a transmembrane region can be a native transmembrane portion of CD28. By “CD28” it can be meant a protein having at least 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identity to NCBI Reference No: NP_006130 or a fragment thereof that has stimulatory activity. By “CD28 nucleic acid molecule” can be meant a polynucleotide encoding a CD28 polypeptide. In some cases, the transmembrane portion can comprise CD8a region. An intracellular signaling region of a CAR can be responsible for activation of at least one of an effector function of the immunoresponsive cell in which the CAR has been placed in. A CAR can induce the effector function of a T cell, for example, which may be cytolytic activity or helper activity including the secretion of cytokines. Thus the term intracellular signaling region refers to the portion of a protein which transduces the effector function signal and directs the cell to perform a specialized function. While usually the entire intracellular signaling region can be employed, in many cases it is not necessary to use the entire chain of a signaling domain. In some cases, a truncated portion of the intracellular signaling region is used. In some cases, the term intracellular signaling region is thus meant to include any truncated portion of the intracellular signaling region sufficient to transduce the effector function signal. Preferred examples of signaling domains for use in a CAR can include a cytoplasmic sequence of the T cell receptor (TCR) and co-receptors that act in concert to initiate signal transduction following target-receptor engagement, as well as any derivative or variant of these sequences and any synthetic sequence that has the same functional capability. In some cases, said intracellular signaling region may contain signaling motifs which are known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Examples of ITAM containing cytoplasmic signaling sequences include those derived from TCR zeta, FcR gamma, FcR beta, CD3 gamma, CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon, CD5, CD22, CD79a, CD79b, and CD66d. However, in preferred embodiments, the intracellular signaling domain is derived from CD3 zeta chain. An example of a T cell signaling domain containing one or more ITAM motifs is the CD3 zeta domain, also known as T-cell receptor T3 zeta chain or CD247. This domain is part of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex and plays an important role in coupling antigen recognition to several intracellular signal-transduction pathways with primary effector activation of the T cell. As used herein, CD3 zeta is primarily directed to human CD3 zeta and its isoforms as known from Swissprot entry P20963, including proteins having a substantially identical sequence. As part of the chimeric antigen receptor, again the full T cell receptor T3 zeta chain is not required and any derivatives thereof comprising the signaling domain of T-cell receptor T3 zeta chain are suitable, including any functional equivalents thereof. An intracellular signaling domain can be selected from any one of the domains of Table 3. In some cases, a domain may be modified so that homology to any one of the refereneced domains may from about 50% to about 100%. Any one of the domains of Table 3 may be modified such that a modified version may comprise from about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or up to about 100% homology. An intracellular signaling region of a CAR can further comprise one or more costimulatory domains. An intracellular signaling region can comprise a single co-stimulatory domain, for example a zeta-chain (1st generation CAR), or CD28 or 4-1BB (2nd generation CAR). In other examples, an intracellular signaling region can comprise two co-stimulatory domains, such as CD28/OX40 or CD28/4-1BB (3rd generation). Together with intracellular signaling domains such as CD8, these co-stimulatory domains can produce downstream activation of kinase pathways, which support gene transcription and functional cellular responses. Co-stimulatory domains of CARs can activate proximal signaling proteins related to either CD28 (Phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase) or 4-1BB/OX40 (TNF-receptor-associated-factor adapter proteins) pathways, and MAPK and Akt activation. In some cases, signals generated through the CAR can be complexed with secondary or co-stimulatory signals. With respect to the co-stimulatory signaling domain, the chimeric antigen receptor like complex can be designed to comprise several possible co-stimulatory signaling domains. As is well known in the art, in naïve T-cells the mere engagement of the T-cell receptor is not sufficient to induce full activation of T-cells into cytotoxic T-cells. Full, productive T cell activation requires a second co-stimulatory signal. Several receptors that have been reported to provide co-stimulation for T-cell activation, include, but are not limited to CD28, OX40, CD27, CD2, CD5, ICAM-1, LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), 4-1BBL, MyD88 and 4-1BB. The signaling pathways utilized by these co-stimulatory molecules share the common property of acting in synergy with the primary T cell receptor activation signal. These co-stimulatory signaling regions provide a signal that can be synergistic with the primary effector activation signal originating from one or more ITAM motifs, for example a CD3 zeta signaling domain, and can complete the requirements for activation of the T cell. In some cases, addition of co-stimulatory domains to a chimeric antigen receptor-like complex can enhance efficacy and durability of engineered cells. In another embodiment the T cell signaling domain and the co-stimulatory domain are fused to one another thereby composing the signaling region.

 In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR can have at least one or more of the following characteristics, in any combination: a) binds to recombinant human GPC3; b) binds to recombinant cynomolgus monkey GPC3; c) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of HepG2 cells; d) binds to cynomolgus monkey GPC3 expressed on the surface of 293 cells; e) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of a cancer cell; f) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of hepatocellular carcinoma cell; g) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of cells of a cell line selected from HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, and JHH-7; h) binds to an epitope within amino acids 25 to 137 of human GPC3; i) binds to an epitope spanning the furin cleavage site at amino acids R358/S359 of human GPC3; j) binds to full-length mature human GPC3, but does not bind to an N-terminal fragment of human GPC3 or to a C-terminal fragment of human GPC3 k) binds to an epitope within amino acids 420 to 470 of human GPC3; 1) binds to an epitope within amino acids 470 to 509 of human GPC3; m) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 7H1; n) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 4G7; o) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 15G1; binds a C-terminal fragment of human GPC3; and/or p) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 4A11. A transgene encoding a subject anti-GPC3 CAR can be incorporated into a cell. For example, a transgene can be incorporated into an immunoresponsive cell, such as a T cell. When inserted into a cell, a transgene can be either a complementary DNA (cDNA) segment, which is a copy of messenger RNA (mRNA), or a gene itself residing in its original region of genomic DNA (with or without introns). A nucleic acid, e.g., DNA, encoding a transgene sequence can be randomly inserted into a chromosome of a cell. A random integration can result from any method of introducing a nucleic acid, e.g., DNA, into a cell. For example, the method can be, but is not limited to, electroporation, sonoporation, use of a gene gun, lipotransfection, calcium phosphate transfection, use of dendrimers, microinjection, and use of viral vectors including adenoviral, AAV, and retroviral vectors, and/or group II ribozymes. A DNA encoding a transgene can be introduced into a cell via electroporation. A DNA can also be introduced into a cell via lipofection, infection, or transformation. Electroporation and/or lipofection can be used to transfect primary cells. Electroporation and/or lipofection can be used to transfect primary hematopoietic cells. A DNA can also be introduced into a cell genome without the use of homologous recombination. In some cases, a DNA can be flanked by engineered sites that are complementary to the targeted double strand break region in a genome. In some cases, a DNA can be excised from a polynucleic acid so it can be inserted at a double strand break region without homologous recombination. A transgene to be inserted can be flanked by engineered sites analogous to a targeted double strand break site in the genome to excise the transgene from a polynucleic acid so it can be inserted at the double strand break region. A DNA encoding a transgene can also be designed to include a reporter gene so that the presence of a transgene or its expression product can be detected via activation of the reporter gene. Any reporter gene can be used, such as those disclosed above. By selecting in cell culture those cells in which a reporter gene has been activated, cells can be selected that contain a transgene. Expression of a CAR can be verified by an expression assay, for example, qPCR or by measuring levels of RNA. Expression level can be indicative also of copy number. For example, if expression levels are extremely high, this can indicate that more than one copy of a CAR was integrated in a genome. Alternatively, high expression can indicate that a transgene was integrated in a highly transcribed area, for example, near a highly expressed promoter. Expression can also be verified by measuring protein levels, such as through Western blotting. A subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can comprise one or more transgenes. One or more transgenes can express a CAR protein recognizing and binding to at least one epitope (e.g., GPC3) on an antigen or bind to a mutated epitope on an antigen. A CAR can be a functional CAR. A subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can also comprise one or more CARs, or it can comprise a single CAR and a secondary engineered receptor. A transgene can encode for a suicide gene. As evidenced in many effective treatments in cancer patients, objective tumor regressions in response to CAR immunoresponsive cells can be accompanied by toxicities. In some cases, a CAR immunoresponsive cell may be unable to distinguish between tumor and normal tissues when the targeted antigen is shared between them (“on-target/off-tumor” toxicity). In other cases, systemic perturbation of the immune system, known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), can occur. Said CRS can comprise systemic inflammatory response syndrome or cytokine storm, which can be consequences of the rapid in vivo expansion of CAR immunoresponsive cells. CRS is a condition characterized by fever and hypotension that, in severe cases, can lead to multiple organ failure. In most cases, said toxicity correlates with the in vivo expansion of infused CAR immunoresponsive cells, which can cause a general perturbation of the immune system, and release of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF alpha and IL-6. In some cases, CAR immunoresponsive cells targeting antigens shared with normal tissues can be generated such that they transiently express the CAR, for example after electroporation of mRNA encoding the receptor. In addition, there are significant efforts to further engineer CAR immunoresponsive cells by including safety switches that can allow the drastic elimination of CAR immunoresponsive cells in case of severe on-target toxicity. Vectors encoding a CAR can be combined with safety switches, such as the inducible caspase-9 gene (activated by a chemical inducer of dimerization) or a truncated form of the EGF receptor R (activated by the monoclonal antibody cetuximab) or RQR8. A subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can encode a suicide gene transgene. Said transgene can also comprise a CAR receptor or another similar receptor. A suicide gene can induce elimination of CAR immunoresponsive cells. A suicide gene can be any gene that induces apoptosis in said CAR immunoresponsive cell. A suicide gene can be encoded within a viral vector along with an anti-GPC3 CAR. One or more transgenes can be from different species. For example, one or more transgenes can comprise a human gene, a mouse gene, a rat gene, a pig gene, a bovine gene, a dog gene, a cat gene, a monkey gene, a chimpanzee gene, or any combination thereof. For example, a transgene can be from a human, having a human genetic sequence. One or more transgenes can comprise human genes. In some cases, one or more transgenes are not adenoviral genes. A transgene can be inserted into a genome of an immunoresponsive cell in a random or site-specific manner, as described above. For example, a transgene can be inserted to a random locus in a genome of an immunoresponsive cell. These transgenes can be functional, e.g., fully functional if inserted anywhere in a genome. For instance, a transgene can encode its own promoter or can be inserted into a position where it is under the control of an endogenous promoter. Alternatively, a transgene can be inserted into a gene, such as an intron of a gene or an exon of a gene, a promoter, or a non-coding region. A transgene can be inserted such that the insertion disrupts a gene, e.g., an endogenous immune checkpoint. Sometimes, more than one copy of a transgene can be inserted into more than a random locus in a genome. For example, multiple copies can be inserted into a random locus in a genome. This can lead to increased overall expression than if a transgene was randomly inserted once. Alternatively, a copy of a transgene can be inserted into a gene, and another copy of a transgene can be inserted into a different gene. A transgene can be targeted so that it could be inserted to a specific locus in a genome of a immunoresponsive cell. In some cases, a polynucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding a subject anti-GPC3 CAR, can take the form of a plasmid vector. A plasmid vector can comprise a promoter. In some cases, a promotor can be constitutive. In some cases, a promoter can be inducible. A promoter can be or can be derived from CMV, U6, MND, or EF1a. In some cases, a promoter can be adjacent to a CAR sequence. In some cases, a plasmid vector further comprises a splicing acceptor. In some cases, a splicing acceptor can be adjacent to a CAR sequence. A promoter sequence can be a PKG or an MND promoter. An MND promoter can be a synthetic promoter that contains a U3 region of a modified MoMuLV LTR with a myeloproliferative sarcoma virus enhancer. In some cases, a polynucleic acid, encoding a subject anti-GPC3 CAR, can be designed to be delivered to a cell by non-viral techniques. In some cases, a polynucleic acid can be a good manufacturing practices (GMP) compatible reagent. Expression of a polynucleic acid encoding for a subject anti-GPC3 CAR can be controlled by one or more promoters. A promoter can be a ubiquitous, constitutive (unregulated promoter that allows for continual transcription of an associated gene), tissue-specific promoter or an inducible promoter. Expression of a transgene that is inserted adjacent to or near a promoter can be regulated. For example, a transgene can be inserted near or next to a ubiquitous promoter. Some ubiquitous promoters can be a CAGGS promoter, an hCMV promoter, a PGK promoter, an SV40 promoter, or a ROSA26 promoter. A promoter can be endogenous or exogenous. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to an endogenous or exogenous ROSA26 promoter. Further, a promoter can be specific to an immunoresponsive cell. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to a porcine ROSA26 promoter. Tissue specific promoter or cell-specific promoters can be used to control the location of expression. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to a tissue-specific promoter. Tissue-specific promoters can be a FABP promoter, an Lck promoter, a CamKII promoter, a CD19 promoter, a Keratin promoter, an Albumin promoter, an aP2 promoter, an insulin promoter, an MCK promoter, a MyHC promoter, a WAP promoter, or a Col2A promoter. Tissue specific promoter or cell-specific promoters can be used to control the location of expression. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to a tissue-specific promoter. Tissue-specific promoters can be a FABP promoter, an Lck promoter, a CamKII promoter, a CD19 promoter, a Keratin promoter, an Albumin promoter, an aP2 promoter, an insulin promoter, an MCK promoter, a MyHC promoter, a WAP promoter, or a Col2A promoter. Inducible promoters can be used as well. These inducible promoters can be turned on and off when desired, by adding or removing an inducing agent. It is contemplated that an inducible promoter can be, but is not limited to, a Lac, tac, trc, trp, araBAD, phoA, recA, proU, cst-1, tetA, cadA, nar, PL, cspA, T7, VHB, Mx, and/or Trex. Furthermore, although not required for expression, transgene sequence may also include transcriptional or translational regulatory sequences, for example, promoters, enhancers, insulators, internal ribosome entry sites, sequences encoding 2A peptides and/or polyadenylation signals. In some instances, a transgene encodes a subject anti-GPC3 CAR wherein the transgene is inserted into a safe harbor such that an anti-GPC3 CAR is expressed. In some instances, the transgene is inserted into a PD1 and/or a CTLA-4 locus. In other cases, a transgene is delivered to the cell in a lentivirus for random insertion while the PD1- or CTLA-4 specific nucleases can be supplied as mRNAs. In some instances, the transgene is delivered via a viral vector system such as a retrovirus, AAV or adenovirus along with mRNA encoding nucleases specific for a safe harbor (e.g. AAVS1, CCR5, albumin or HPRT). The cells can also be treated with mRNAs encoding PD1 and/or CTLA-4 specific nucleases. In some cases, the polynucleotide encoding a CAR is supplied via a viral delivery system together with mRNA encoding HPRT specific nucleases and PD 1- or CTLA-4 specific nucleases. CARs that can be used with the methods and compositions disclosed herein can include all types of these chimeric proteins, including first, second and third generation designs. Other agents such as CCR2 or siRNA can be applied to reduce PD-1 expression. In some cases, a retroviral vector (either gamma-retroviral or lentiviral) can be employed for the introduction of the transgene into an immunoresponsive cell. For example, a transgene encoding a CAR (e.g., anti-GPC3 CAR), or any receptor that binds a GPC3 antigen, or a variant, or a fragment thereof, can be cloned into a retroviral vector and expression can be driven from its endogenous promoter, from the retroviral long terminal repeat, or from a promoter specific for a target cell type of interest. Non-viral vectors may be used as well. Non-viral vector delivery systems can include DNA plasmids, naked nucleic acid, and nucleic acid complexed with a delivery vehicle such as a liposome or poloxamer. A number of viral based systems have been developed for gene transfer into mammalian cells. For example, retroviruses provide a convenient platform for gene delivery systems. A selected gene can be inserted into a vector and packaged in retroviral particles using techniques known in the art. Vectors derived from retroviruses such as the lentivirus are suitable tools to achieve long-term gene transfer since they allow long-term, stable integration of a transgene and its propagation in daughter cells. Lentiviral vectors have the added advantage over vectors derived from onco-retroviruses such as murine leukemia viruses in that they can transduce non-proliferating cells. They also have the added advantage of low immunogenicity. Adenoviral vectors have the advantage that they do not integrate into the genome of the target cell thereby bypassing negative integration-related events. A cell can be transfected with a transgene encoding a CAR. A transgene concentration can be from about 100 picograms to about 50 micrograms. In some cases, the amount of nucleic acid (e.g., ssDNA, dsDNA, RNA) that may be introduced into a cell may be varied to optimize transfection efficiency and/or cell viability. For example, 1 microgram of dsDNA may be added to each cell sample for electroporation. In some cases, the amount of nucleic acid (e.g., dsDNA) required for optimal transfection efficiency and/or cell viability may be specific to the cell type. In some cases, the amount of nucleic acid (e.g., dsDNA) used for each sample may directly correspond to the transfection efficiency and/or cell viability. For example, a range of concentrations of transfections. A transgene encoded by a vector can integrate into a cellular genome. In some cases, integration of a transgene encoded by a vector is in the forward direction. In other cases, integration of a transgene encoded by a vector is in the reverse direction. In some cases, the starting cell density for cellular modification, such as viral delivery of a CAR, may be varied to optimize transfection efficiency and/or cell viability. In some cases, the starting cell density for transfection or transduction of cells with a viral vector may be less than about 1×105 cells. In some cases, the starting cell density for cellular modification with a viral vector may be at least about 1×105 cells to at least about 5×107 cells. In some cases, the starting cell density for optimal transfection efficiency and/or cell viability may be specific to the cell type. For example, a starting cell density of 1.5×106 cells may optimal (e.g., provide the highest viability and/or transfection efficiency) for macrophage cells. In another example, a starting cell density of 5×106 cells may optimal (e.g., provide the highest viability and/or transfection efficiency) for human cells. In some cases, a range of starting cell densities may be optimal for a given cell type. For example, a starting cell density between of 5.6×106 and 5×107 cells may optimal (e.g., provide the highest viability and/or transfection efficiency) for human cells such as T cells. The efficiency of integration of a nucleic acid sequence encoding CAR into a genome of a cell with, for example, a viral system, can be or can be about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, or more than 99.9%. In some cases, detection of a CAR on a cellular membrane of an engineered cell can be or can be about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, or more than 99.9% as measured by flow cytometry. In some cases, the immunoresponsive cell can be a stem memory TSCM cell comprised of CD45RO (−), CCR7(+), CD45RA (+), CD62L+(L-selectin), CD27+, CD28+ and/or IL-7Rα+, said stem memory cells can also express CD95, IL-2Rβ, CXCR3, and/or LFA-1, and show numerous functional attributes distinctive of said stem memory cells. Alternatively, the immunoresponsive cell can also be central memory TCM cells comprising L-selectin and CCR7, where the central memory cells can secrete, for example, IL-2, but not IFNγ or IL-4. The immunoresponsive cells can also be effector memory TEM cells comprising L-selectin or CCR7 and produce, for example, effector cytokines such as IFNγ and IL-4. Vectors can be delivered in vivo by administration to an individual patient, typically by systemic administration (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subdermal, or intracranial infusion) or topical application, as described below. Alternatively, vectors can be delivered to cells ex vivo, such as cells explanted from an individual patient (e.g., lymphocytes, T cells, bone marrow aspirates, tissue biopsy), followed by reimplantation of the cells into a patient, usually after selection for cells which have incorporated the vector. Prior to or after selection, the cells can be expanded. A suitable immunoresponsive cell for expressing anti-GPC3-CAR can be a cell that may be autologous or non-autologous to a subject in need thereof. A source of suitable immunoresponsive cells can be obtained from a subject. In some cases T cells can be obtained. Said T cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including PBMCs, bone marrow, lymph node tissue, cord blood, thymus tissue, and tissue from a site of infection, ascites, pleural effusion, spleen tissue, and tumors. In certain cases, T cells can be obtained from a unit of blood collected from a subject using any number of techniques known to the skilled artisan, such as Ficoll™ separation. In one embodiment, cells from the circulating blood of an individual are obtained by apheresis. The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. In one embodiment, the cells collected by apheresis may be washed to remove the plasma fraction and to place the cells in an appropriate buffer or media for subsequent processing steps. Alternatively, a cell can be derived from a healthy donor, from a patient diagnosed with cancer, or from a patient diagnosed with an infection. In another embodiment, a cell can be part of a mixed population of cells which present different phenotypic characteristics. A cell line can also be obtained from a transformed T cell according to the method previously described. A cell can also be obtained from a cell therapy bank. Modified cells resistant to an immunosuppressive treatment can be obtained by any of the method described herein. A desirable cell population can also be selected prior to modification. An engineered cell population can also be selected after modification. An engineered cell can be used in autologous transplantation. Alternatively, a cell can be used in allogeneic transplantation. In some instances, a cell is administered to the same patient whose sample was used to identify the cancer-related target sequence. In other instances, a cell is administered to a patient different from the patient whose sample was used to identify the cancer-related target sequence. In some cases, an immune responsive cell can be a primary cell including primary T cell, a stem cell, or a progenitor cell. A progenitor cell can be a hematopoietic progenitor cell. A cell of the present invention can be a human cell. Suitable cells can be expanded ex vivo. A suitable cell can also be CD45RO(−), CCR7(+), CD45RA(+), CD62L(+), CD27(+), CD28(+), IL-7Ra(+), or combinations thereof. In some cases, suitable primary cells include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and other blood cell subsets such as, but not limited to, T cell, a natural killer cell, a monocyte, a natural killer T cell, a monocyte-precursor cell, a hematopoietic stem cell or a non-pluripotent stem cell. In some cases, the cell can be any immune cells including any T-cell such as tumor infiltrating cells (TILs), such as CD3+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, or any other type of T-cell. The T cell can also include memory T cells, memory stem T cells, or effector T cells. The T cells can also be selected from a bulk population, for example, selecting T cells from whole blood. The T cells can also be expanded from a bulk population. The T cells can also be skewed towards particular populations and phenotypes. For example, the T cells can be skewed to phenotypically comprise, CD45RO (−), CCR7 (+), CD45RA (+), CD62L (+), CD27 (+), CD28 (+) and/or IL-7Ra (+). Suitable cells can be selected that comprise one of more markers selected from a list comprising: CD45RO (−), CCR7 (+), CD45RA (+), CD62L (+), CD27 (+), CD28 (+) and/or IL-7Rα (+). Suitable cells also include stem cells such as, by way of example, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, neuronal stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells. Suitable cells can comprise any number of primary cells, such as human cells, non-human cells, and/or mouse cells. Suitable cells can be progenitor cells. Suitable cells can be derived from the subject to be treated (e.g., patient). Suitable cells can be derived from a human donor. Suitable cells can be stem memory TSCM cells comprised of CD45RO (−), CCR7(+), CD45RA (+), CD62L+(L-selectin), CD27+, CD28+ and IL-7Rα+, said stem memory cells can also express CD95, IL-2Rβ, CXCR3, and LFA-1, and show numerous functional attributes distinctive of said stem memory cells. Suitable cells can be central memory TCM cells comprising L-selectin and CCR7, said central memory cells can secrete, for example, IL-2, but not IFNγ or IL-4. Suitable cells can also be effector memory TEM cells comprising L-selectin or CCR7 and produce, for example, effector cytokines such as IFNγ and IL-4. In some cases, a method can include enriching cultured T cells for CD8+ T cells prior to rapid expansion of cells. Following culture of T cells in IL-2, the T cells can be depleted of CD4+ cells and enriched for CD8+ cells using, for example, a CD8 microbead separation (e.g., using a CliniMACSplus CD8 microbead system (Miltenyi Biotec)). Without being bound to a particular theory, it can be believed that CD4+, CD25+ regulatory T-cells can impede anti-tumor responses. Accordingly, it can be believed that enriching cultured T cells for CD8+ T cells and reducing or eliminating CD4+ cells may improve the impact of adoptively transferred anti-tumor CD8+ cells, improve the response rates in patients, and/or reduce the toxicities seen by production of cytokines by CD4+ cells. Additionally, enriched CD8+ “young” T cells can be believed to behave more reliably and predictably in clinical scale rapid expansions than the bulk T cells. A cell can be a good manufacturing practices (GMP) compatible reagent. A cell can be part of a combination therapy to treat cancer, infections, autoimmune disorders, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a subject in need thereof. In some cases, a cell of the present invention can be administered of a subject in need thereof as a monotherapy. In some cases, cells expressing a subject CAR include heterogeneous T cell populations. In some cases, cells used can be largely composed of a heterogeneous proportion of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Said CD4 and CD8 cells can have phenotypic characteristics of circulating effector T cells. Said CD4 and CD8 cells can also have a phenotypic characteristic of effector-memory cells. In another embodiment, cells can be central-memory cells. Suitable cells that can be isolated from a donor can be at any stage of development including, but not limited to, fetal, neonatal, young and adult. For example, donor immunoresponsive cells can be isolated from adult human Donor human immunoresponsive cells can be under the age of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 year(s). For example, immunoresponsive cells can be isolated from a human under the age of 6 years Immunoresponsive cells can also be isolated from a human under the age of 3 years. A donor can be older than 10 years. A method of attaining suitable cells can comprise selecting based on a given marker. For example, such marker can comprise GFP, a resistance gene, a cell surface marker, or an endogenous tag. Cells can be selected using any endogenous marker. Applicable cell selection techniques include flow cytometry and/or magnetic columns. Selected cells can subsequently be infused into a subject. Selected cells can also be expanded to large numbers. Selected cells can be expanded prior to infusion. The amount of cells that are necessary to be therapeutically effective in a patient may vary depending on the viability of the cells, and the efficiency with which the cells have been genetically modified (e.g., the efficiency with which a transgene has been integrated into one or more cells, or a level of expression of a protein encoded by the transgene). In some cases, the product (e.g., multiplication) of the viability of cells post genetic modification and the efficiency of integration of a transgene may correspond to the therapeutic aliquot of cells available for administration to a subject. In some cases, an increase in the viability of cells post genetic modification may correspond to a decrease in the amount of cells that are necessary for administration to be therapeutically effective in a patient. In some cases, an increase in the efficiency with which a transgene has been integrated into one or more cells may correspond to a decrease in the amount of cells that are necessary for administration to be therapeutically effective in a patient. In some cases, determining an amount of cells that are necessary to be therapeutically effective may comprise determining a function corresponding to a change in the viability of cells over time. In some cases, determining an amount of cells that are necessary to be therapeutically effective may comprise determining a function corresponding to a change in the efficiency with which a transgene may be integrated into one or more cells with respect to time dependent variables (e.g., cell culture time, electroporation time, cell stimulation time). In some cases, therapeutically effective cells can be a population of cells that comprise from about 30% to about 100% expression of an anti-GPC3 CAR on a cellular surface. In some cases, therapeutically effective cells can express an anti-GPC3 CAR on a cellular surface from about 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, to more than about 99.9% as measured by flow cytometry. A variety of cells can be used to express the subject CAR, as described above. Anti-GPC3 CAR can be present in the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell, e.g., a mammalian cell, where suitable mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, a cytotoxic cell, a T lymphocyte, a stem cell, a progeny of a stem cell, a progenitor cell, a progeny of a progenitor cell, and an NK cell. When present in the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell, a CAR can be active in the presence of its binding target. For example, an anti-GPC3 CAR can be active in the presence of GPC3. A target, such as GPC3, can be expressed on a membrane. A target can also be soluble (e.g., not bound to a cell). A target can be present on the surface of a cell such as a target cell. A target can be presented on a solid surface such as a lipid bilayer; and the like. A target can be soluble, such as a soluble antigen. A target can be an antigen. An antigen can be present on the surface of a cell such as a target cell. An antigen can be presented on a solid surface such as a lipid bilayer; and the like. In some cases, a target can be an epitope of an antigen. In methods disclosed herein, the antigen is typically GPC3 and the GPC3 expressing target cell is a cancer or tumor cell. In some instances, a CAR, when present on the plasma membrane of a cell, and when activated by binding its target, can result in cytotoxic activity by the cell toward a target that expresses on its cell surface an antigen to which the binding domain of the CAR binds. For example, in some cases a cell can be a cytotoxic cell (e.g., an NK cell or a cytotoxic T lymphocyte), a CAR of the present disclosure, when present in the plasma membrane of a cell, and when activated by binding its target, can increase cytotoxic activity of a cytotoxic cell toward a target cell that expresses on its cell surface an antigen to which the binding domain of a CAR binds. For example, in some cases a cell can be an NK cell or a T lymphocyte, a CAR of the present disclosure, when present in the plasma membrane of a cell, and when activated by binding of its target, can increase cytotoxic activity of a cell by at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 2-fold, at least 2.5-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, or more 10-fold, compared to the cytotoxic activity of the cell in the absence of the binding target. In some cases, a CAR, when activated by binding its target, can result in other CAR activation related events such as proliferation and expansion (either due to increased cellular division or anti-apoptotic responses). Cellular proliferation can be visually measured by the observance of cellular clumping as seen under a microscope. Cellular expansion can be measured by a hemocytometer measurement. In some cases, a CAR-T cell can have increased cellular proliferation and expansion when compared to a comparable T cell, a non-CAR T cell. Increased cellular expansion can be from about 1 fold to about 20 hold over that of a comparable cell. Increased cellular expansion can be from about 1 fold, 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 5 fold, 6 fold, 7 fold, 8 fold, 9 fold, 10 fold, 11 fold, 12 fold, 13 fold, 14 fold, 15 fold, 16 fold, 17 fold, 18 fold, 19 fold, or up to 20 fold over that of a comparable cell. Cellular expansion can be measured over a period of time. For example, cellular expansion can take place from cellular acquision to the time of infusion into a subject. In other cases, cellular expansion can take place from about 1 day to up to about 30 days after acquisition. Cellular expansion can take place from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or up to 30 days after acquisition. In some cases, a rapid expansion protocol (REP) can be utilized to expand cells prior to infusion into a subject. A REP can occur over a period of about 14 days in some cases. In some cases, a CAR, when activated by binding its target, can result in other CAR activation related events such as intracellular signaling modulation, cellular differentiation, or cell death. In some cases, expression of a CAR on a cell may alter intracellular signaling of a cell. In other cases, expression of a CAR may alter cellular differentiation. Subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered to a subject exhibiting a GPC3 expressing cancer or tumor either concurrently or after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some aspects, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells are administered after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. The treatment can reduce the circulating lymphocytes in a treated subject, or substantially deplete the circulating lymphocytes the lymphocyte (i.e., lymphocyte reduction). For example, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered at least 1 hour to at least 1 week after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. For example, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered at least 1 hour, 2 hours, 4, hours, 6, hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12, hours, 14 hours, 16 hours, 18 hours, 20 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, or 7 days or longer after lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, CAR-T can be administered about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 weeks, or longer after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, host lymphopenia can facilitate expansion of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as CAR T cells. On the one hand, lymphopenia can create “space” for oncoming adoptively transferred cells and, on the other, it can induce their homeostatic expansion. The latter effect can be likely mediated through chemotherapeutic ablation of endogenous regulatory T cells, which can normally secrete inhibitory cytokines (e.g. TGF-β and IL-10) that can limit effector cell expansion, such as CAR T cells. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can improve expansion of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in vivo by about 1 fold, 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 5 fold, 6 fold, 7 fold, 8 fold, 9 fold, 10 fold, 11 fold, 12 fold, 13 fold, 14 fold, 15 fold, 16 fold, 17 fold, 18 fold, 19 fold, or up to 20 fold over treatment with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells without a lymphocyte reduction treatment. Additionally, T-cell growth homeostatic cytokines, such as IL-7 and IL-15, which may ordinarily exist in limiting amounts, may become readily available due to less competition and increased production by lymphopoietic stromal cells. Thus, induction of lymphocyte reduction prior to infusion of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells may be performed to increase efficacy of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in treating a subject. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-tumor efficacy as measured by tumor reduction or control by about 10% to about 100% over treatment without a lymphocyte reduction treatment. For example a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-tumor efficacy from about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or up to 100% over treatment without a lymphocyte reduction treatment. A lymphocyte reduction can be performed using various means. Lymphocyte reduction before anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells administration can be performed using total body irradiation (TBI) or cytotoxic drugs. Although these modalities may intended to deplete the lymphoid compartment of a recipient, they can also facilitate the presentation of tumor antigens by triggering tumor cell death and antigen release. Subsequently, these antigens can be taken up and presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs) to enhance the activation of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. Irradiation and/or chemotherapy can lead to activation of host cells, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-4, and upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy by activation of host cells. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy by upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules. In addition to enhanced APC function and availability, a preconditioning regimen can damage the integrity of mucosal barriers through radiation-induced apoptosis of cells lining these organs. Damage inflicted on the intestinal tract might permit the translocation of bacterial products, such as LPS, into the systemic circulation. LPS can in turn activate anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in vivo and might enhance the antitumor response. Thus, proinflammatory cytokines and microbial products provide crucial ‘danger signals’ for the activation and maturation of DCs, thus enhancing anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell-mediated tumor treatment. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can selectively deplete CD25-expressing cells in humans, including humanized anti-Tac (anti-CD25) and ONTAK™ (IL-2 conjugated to diphtheria toxin). In some cases, a chemotherapeutic can be administered to effect lymphocyte reduction in a subject. In some cases, a subject may receive nonmyeloablative lympho-reduction chemotherapy. A nonmyeloablative lympho-reduction chemotherapy can be any suitable such therapy, which can be administered by any suitable route. Chemotherapeutic regimens may include use of single alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil, or combinations such as CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone), CHOP (CVP and doxorubicin), C-MOPP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine), CAP-BOP (CHOP plus procarbazine and bleomycin), m-BACOD (CHOP plus methotrexate, bleomycin and leucovorin), ProMACE-MOPP (prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and leucovorin plus standard MOPP), ProMACE-CytaBOM (prednisone, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, methotrexate and leucovorin) and MACOP-B (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, fixed dose prednisone, bleomycin and leucovorin). A nonmyeloablative lympho-reduction chemotherapy can comprise, for example, administration of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, particularly if a cancer is GPC3 positive, which can be metastatic. A preferred route of administering cyclophosphamide and fludarabine can be intravenously. Likewise, any suitable dose of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine can be administered. Preferably, around 60 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide can be administered for two days after which around 25 mg/m2 fludarabine can be administered for about five days. In some cases, lymphocyte reduction can be performed to minimize immune-mediated anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell rejection. For example, a subject can be treated with cyclophosphamide (Cy) followed by fludarabine (Flu) lymphocyte reduction treatment. A dose of a chemotherapeutic such as Cy can be from about 1 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg. A dose of Cy can be from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 79 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or up to about 200 mg/kg of a subject. Alternatively, an exemplary dose and regimen for Cy treatment can be from about 0.5˜5 g/m2/day, preferably 0.6˜3 g/m2/d, more preferably 1˜2 g/m2/day, for 1-3 days, preferably 1-2 days; A dose of Flu can be from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 79 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or up to about 200 mg/m2 of a subject. Alternatively, an exemplary dose and regimen for fludarabine treatment can be from about 20˜80 mg/m2/day, preferably 25˜70 mg/m2/day or 25˜30 mg/m2/day, for 2˜10, 3˜8 or 4, 5, 6 or 7 days; In some cases, combined use of Cy and Flu can be applied. For example, initial dose of Flu in the range of about 10˜60 mg/m2/day or 15˜50 mg/m2/day or 20˜30 mg/m2/day for 2˜8 days or 3˜6 days, is followed by Cy in the amount of about 0.2˜1 mg/m2/day or 0.3˜0.8 mg/m2/day or 0.4˜0.6 g/m2/day for 1-5 or 2-3 days. In some cases, a subject can be treated with Cy and Flu at Cy 60 mg/kg×1 administration and Flu 25 mg/m2×3 to 5 administrations before anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. A subject can receive from about 0 to about 20 administrations of a lymphodepletant before an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. A subject can receive from about 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, up to about 20 administrations of a lymphodepletant, such as Cy or Flu, prior to anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. In other cases, a subject may be co-administered a lymphodepletant, such as Cy and/or Flu, concurrent with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. In other cases, a subject may be administered a lymphodepletant, such as Cy and/or Flu, after an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell administration. In other cases, a subject may be administered a lymphodepletant prior, concurrent, and/or after an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell administration. A subject may not receive a lymphocyte reduction treatment is some cases. In some cases, different doses of lymphodepletants may be used during the course of a regime. For example, a subject may receive 60 mg/kg of Cy prior to anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, followed by a dose of 40 mg/kg of Cy concurrent with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. A complete blood count (CBC) may be performed to determine the extent of lymphocyte reduction and if additional administrations may be required. In some cases, Cy may be administered alone. In other cases, Flu may be administered alone. In some cases, Cy and Flu may be alternated during a regime. Lymphocyte reduction may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell expansion. Lymphocyte reduction may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell persistence in blood. Anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell expansion and persistence may be detected by flow cytometric analysis utilizing an anti-CAR antibody. Anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell persistence may also be measured by evaluating copy number of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell by qPCR. In some cases, a subject may receive a reduction in anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell dose if subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment compared to a subject that may not receive a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can be administered over a period of time. For example a lymphocyte reduction treatment may be administered over the course of 1 min up to about 24 hours. A lymphocyte reduction treatment may be performed from 1 min, 15 min, 45 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 21 hours, 22 hours, 23 hours, or up to about 24 hours. Lympho-reduction agents may be coadministered with additional agents such as diluents, uroprotectants, excipients, or a combination thereof. For example, sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (Mesna) may be included in a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, a subject may be administered cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for about 2 days IV in 250 ml D5W with Mesna 15 mg/kg/day for 2 days over 1 hr. Mesna may be coadministered with a lymphodepletant at various doses. For example, Mesna may be administered from about 1 mg/kg/day up to about 50 mg/kg/day. Mesna may be administered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or up to about 50 mg/kg/day. In some cases, for obese or pediatric subjects a drug dosage may be calculated using practical weight. Practical weight may be an average of an actual weight and an ideal body weight. For example, ideal body weight may be calculated for a male=50 kg+2.3 (number of inches over 60 inches). An ideal body weight may be calculated for a female=45.5 kg+2.3 (number of inches over 60 inches). In some cases, a Flu administration can be 25 mg/m2/day IVPB daily over 30 minutes for 5 days. In some cases, a Flu administration can occur before a Cy administration. In some cases, a Flu administration can be performed concurrent with Cy. In some cases, a Flu administration can be performed after a Cy administration. In some cases, fludarabine can be started approximately 1 to 2 hours after the Cy and mesna. Total body irradiation can be a form of radiotherapy. As the name implies, TBI can involve irradiation of the entire body, though in modern practice the lungs can be partially shielded to lower the risk of radiation-induced lung injury. Total body irradiation can be administered at various doses. For example, total body irradiation can be administered from about 10 to about 12 Gy. In some cases, total body irradiation can be fractionated, with smaller doses delivered in several sessions, rather than delivering the entire dose at once. In some cases, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or up to 10 different doses of irradiation can be administered. The reported D0 value—the amount of ionizing radiation necessary to eradicate a particular cell type—of hematopoietic stem cells can be from about 0.5 to about 1.4 Gy, while those of human leukemia cell lines can be from about 0.8 to about 1.5 Gy, indicating that both cells are radiosensitive. The ideal dosing schedule can depend on patient age, disease and the intended type of treatment. Myeloablative TBI can be from about 12 to about 15 Gy given in about 8 to about 12 fractions over about 4 days, with about 2 to about 3 treatments daily. In some cases, myeloablative TBI can be from about 5 to about 20 Gy. Myeloablative TBI can be from about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, to about 20 Gy. In some cases, myeloablative TBI can be given in about 5 to about 20 fractions. Myeloablative TBI can be given in about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, to about 20 fractions. Myeloablative therapy can be given over about 1 to about 10 days. Myeloablatic therapy can be administered over about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or up to about 10 days. In some cases, a low-dose TBI can include doses of about 2 to about 8 Gy given in about 1 to about 4 fractions. In some cases, a low-dose TBI can include doses of about 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, or up to about 8 Gy. A low-dose TBI can be administered to a subject who may not tolerate myeloablation due to age or comorbidity. TBI can be administered using parallel opposed pairs of high-energy photon beams from about 4 to about 18 MV for TBI. In some cases, photon beams can be from about 1 to about 25 MV for TBI. Photon beams can be from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or up to about 25 MV. TCI can be performed using equipment such as a Varian Clinac iX or a Siemens Artiste. In some cases a rate of administration can be from about 5 cGy/min to about 100 cGy/min. A Rate of administration can be from about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 79 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, or up to 100 cGy/min. In some cases, certain organs can be shielded during radiation. For example, a liver, lung, brain, heart, or a combination thereof may be shielded during total body irradiation. Biological Agents In some cases, a biological agent such as an antibody can be used to deplete immune cells. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are cytolytic for lymphocytes may be an alternative means of yielding lymphocyte reduction. In some cases, an antibody for T-cell lymphocyte reduction that may be administered before anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion should be effective but short lived in vivo, to permit rapid infusion and repopulation with infused anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. Antibodies used can be directed to markers expressed on a surface of a cell, such as a lymphocyte. In some cases, lympho-reduction antibodies can be anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD45, anti-CD25, anti-CD52, and any combination thereof. Antibodies such as Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), Bortezomib, thymoglobulin (rabbit ATG, Genzyme), ATGAM (equine ATG, Pfizer), and alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) can be used. Rituximab (IDEC-C2B8), GA101, a humanized IgG1 to CD20, XmAb5574, an Fc-engineered antibody to CD19, alefacept (LFA3-Ig), fingolimod (FTY720), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), anti-CD4 antibodies, anti-CD3 antibodies, anti-CD8 antibodies, can also be used as a lymphocyte reduction agent. In some cases, Cladribine (2-CdA, Leustatin®), a purine analog similar to fludarabine, can be used. In some cases, an antibody lymphocyte reduction treatment can include a single antibody such as alemtuzumab (anti-CD52). In other cases, an antibody-based lymphocyte reduction treatment can include at least two antibodies, such as alemtuzumab and anti-CD45. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can include multiple lympho-reduction modalities, such as radiation combined with an antibody therapy or a chemotherapy combined with radiation. Chemotherapy and antibody therapy may also be used in combination. Antibiotics, Anti-fungals and Anti-virals can be given to subjects as prophylaxis during a lymphocyte reduction treatment. For example, a prophylaxis may include Altrex 500 mg daily, Bactrium DS one tablet q M W F and Fluconazole 200 mg daily. The duration of medication is until Absolute Lymphocyte count (ALC) and Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) count may return to pre medication baseline. A biological agent can also be Adriamycin. One or more cytokines can be introduced with cells. Cytokines can be utilized to boost transferred cells (including adoptively transferred tumor-specific cells) to expand within a tumor microenvironment. In some cases, IL-2 can be used to facilitate expansion of the cells described herein. Cytokines such as IL-15 can also be employed. Other relevant cytokines in the field of immunotherapy can also be utilized, such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, and, L-21, or any combination thereof. In some cases, recombinant cytokines are used. In some cases, a T-cell growth factor can be administered. A growth factor can be administered by any suitable route. If more than one T-cell growth factor is administered, they can be administered simultaneously or sequentially, in any order, and by the same route or different routes. A T-cell growth factor, such as Aldesleukin (IL-2), can be administered intravenously as a bolus injection. A dosage of a T-cell growth factor, such as IL-2, is what is considered by those of ordinary skill in the art to be high. Preferably, a dose of about 720,000 IU/kg of IL-2 can be administered three times daily until tolerance. Is come cases, about 5 to about 15 doses of IL-2 are administered, with an average of around 9 doses. A dosage of a T cell growth factor can be from about 0 to about 20. A T cell growth factor can be administered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or up to about 20 times. IL-2 can be administered at a dose of 720,000 IU/kg (based on total body weight) as an intravenous bolus. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered over a 15-minute period. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered over a 20-minute period. IL-2 can be administered by immediate injection. In some cases IL-2 can be administered over 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, or up to a period of 6 hours. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered beginning within 24 hours of cell infusion and continuing for up to about 4 days (maximum 12 doses). In some cases, IL-2 can be administered for up to about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 days after an initial administration. Doses of IL-2 can be administered every eight hours. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered from about every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 hours after an initial administration. In some cases, IL-2 dosing can be stopped if toxicities are detected. In some cases, doses can be delayed or stopped if patients reach Grade 3 or 4 toxicity due to aldesleukin except for the reversible Grade 3 toxicities common to Aldesleukin such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, skin changes, anorexia, mucositis, dysphagia, or constitutional symptoms and laboratory changes. In some cases, if these toxicities can be easily reversed within 24 hours by supportive measures, then additional doses may be given. In addition, dosing may be held or stopped at the discretion of the treating physician. In some cases, an immunoresponsive cell that expresses an anti-GPC3 CAR can have increased anti-tumor efficacy compared to a comparable immunoresponsive cell that does not express the anti-GPC3 CAR. In some cases, anti-tumor efficacy can refer to cytotoxic activity. In other cases, anti-tumor efficacy can refer to persistence. Anti-tumor efficacy can also refer to the ability of a cell to target a tumor. Anti-tumor efficacy can be measured using various in vitro assays. For example, cytotoxic ability can be measured by an ELISA that measures release of interleukin-2 (IL-2) or Interferon-γ (IFNγ). Cytotoxic activity can be measured by a killing assay such as a chromium-51 release assay or a co-culture assay. In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can have increased anti-tumor efficacy and ability when compared to comparable cells. An anti-GPC3 CAR treatment efficacy can be evaluated using multiple modalities. Efficacy can refer to anti-tumor efficacy that is the extent to which a tumor, such as a GPC3-positive tumor, is controlled, reduced, or eliminated. Treatment efficacy can also refer to CAR immunoresponsive cell expansion, persistence, tumor-targeting, and any combination thereof. A subject that can be administered an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy, such as anti-GPC3 CAR T cell therapy, can be evaluated during an infusion, immediately after an infusion, or up to years following an infusion. For example, a treated subject can return to a clinic for evaluation for a period of about 1 day to the length of the subject's life. A treated subject can be evaluated from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, or up to 90 years after an initial administration of the subject CAR immunoresponsive cells. In some cases, an evaluation schedule can include daily monitoring, weekly monitoring, monthly monitoring, or yearly monitoring. In some cases, a subject can be seen more frequently as clinically indicated. An evaluation can include a physical exam, chemistry evaluation, complete blood count, thyroid panel, toxicity assessment, computerized tomography (CT) scan of a bodily area, apheresis, and any combination thereof. In some cases, apheresis may be performed prior to and from about 1 to about 10 weeks following administration of a subject CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. At other time points, a subject's peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) can be obtained from whole blood by purification using centrifugation on a Ficoll gradiant. Aliquots of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC5) can be cryopreserved for immunological monitoring of cell function. In some cases, a variety of tests can include evaluation of specific lysis and cytokine release, metabolomic and bioenergetic studies (using Seahorse), intracellular FACS of cytokine production, ELISA-spot assays, and lymphocyte subset analysis may be used to evaluate the immunological correlates of a subject CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment. In general, differences of about 2 to about 3 fold in these assays may be indicative of true biologic differences. In some cases, different of about 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, up to about 5 fold of in vitro assays, post anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy, may be indicative of treatment efficacy. In some cases, a subject CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment may reduce tumor size by at least 30% as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scan or an MRI. An anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment may reduce tumor size by at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or up to about 100%. A CAR-T treatment may eliminate a tumor as measured by CT scan. In some cases, an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment may stabilize a tumor size as measured by a less than 10% change in a baseline measurement of a diameter of a tumor lesion as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scan. For example, a tumor may not expand in size after administration of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. In some cases, stabilization may be considered a less than 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1% change in tumor size as compared to a pre-treatment measurement. In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell efficacy can be considered in terms of subject survival time. For example, a subject that is treated with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as an anti-GPC3 CAR T cells, can survive longer than an untreated subject or a subject treated with a different therapy. In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell efficacy can be improved by the addition of a secondary treatment, such as lymphocyte reduction treatment. A secondary treatment can synergize with a anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy. In some cases, a secondary treatment can produce additive effects of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy. A secondary treatment can be lymphocyte reduction as well as additional forms of cellular therapy, antibody therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, anti-angiogenic therapy, and any combination thereof. Treatment response can be evaluated using the international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (Version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of a tumor lesion and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes can be used in the RECIST criteria. For example, measurable lesions can be those defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node can be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), can be considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, can be considered as non-measurable. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, can be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions can be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions can be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis can be added into the sum. A baseline sum diameter will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. In some cases, a clinical lesion can be considered measurable when it can be superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and about 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In cases, where a caliper cannot be used to measure a lesion, a CT scan or MRI can also be used. In some cases, a CT scan can yield slices of tissue from about 5 mm or less. A CT scan can have 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm or 0.5 mm scan thickness in some cases. If a CT scan has a slice thickness greater than 5 mm, a minimum size for a measurable lesion can be twice the slice thickness. In some cases, an MRI can also be performed to evaluate a subject. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans when determining treatment efficacy. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. In some cases, a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to measure treatment efficacy. Once a subject has been evaluated, target lesions can be grouped into stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), partial response (PR), and/or a complete response (CR). A SD can be considered neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters. A PD can be considered at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum (this can include the baseline sum if that may be the smallest). In some cases, in addition to a relative increase of about 20%, a sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least about 5 mm. A PR can be at least about 30% decrease in a sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. A CR can be elimination of target lesions. In some cases, administration of anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as anti-GPC3 CAR T cells, and a lymphocyte reduction treatment can synergistically increase a subject's median survival time by at least about 6 months as compared to administering the anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cells alone, Table 6. In some cases, a combination of an anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy and a lymphocyte reduction treatment can synergistically increase a subject's survival time by at least about 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, 10 years, or up to about 25 years as compared to administering the anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cells alone.

 Subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be formulation into a pharmaceutical medicament and be used to treat a human or mammal, in need thereof, diagnosed with a disease, e.g., cancer. These pharmaceutical medicaments can be co-administered to a human or mammal, together with one or more chemotherapeutic agent or chemotherapeutic compound. Populations of subject CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as CAR T cells, may be formulated for administration to a subject using techniques known to the skilled artisan. Formulations comprising populations of CAR immunoresponsive cells may include pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s). Excipients included in the formulations will have different purposes depending, for example, on the subpopulation of T cells used and the mode of administration. Examples of generally used excipients included, without limitation: saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water-for-injection, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof, stabilizing agents, solubilizing agents and surfactants, buffers and preservatives, tonicity agents, bulking agents, and lubricating agents. The formulations comprising populations of CAR immunoresponsive cells will typically have been prepared and cultured in the absence of any non-human components, such as animal serum. A formulation may include one population of CAR immunoresposive cells, or more than one, such as two, three, four, five, six or more populations of CAR immunoresposive cells. For example, a formulation may include one population of CAR T cells, or more than one, such as two, three, four, five, six or more populations of CAR T cells. Formulations comprising population(s) of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells may be administered to a subject using modes and techniques known to the skilled artisan. Exemplary modes include, but are not limited to, intravenous injection. Other modes include, without limitation, intratumoral, intradermal, subcutaneous (S.C., s.q., sub-Q, Hypo), intramuscular (i.m.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), intra-arterial, intramedullary, intracardiac, intra-articular (joint), intrasynovial (joint fluid area), intracranial, intraspinal, and intrathecal (spinal fluids). Any known device useful for parenteral injection of infusion of the formulations can be used to effect such administration. Formulations comprising population(s) of CAR immunoresponsive cells that are administered to a subject comprise a number of CAR immunoresponsive cells that is effective for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the specific indication or disease. Thus, therapeutically-effective populations of CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered to subjects. In general, formulations are administered that comprise between about 1×104 and about 1×1010 CAR immunoresponsive cells. In most cases, the formulation will comprise between about 1×105 and about 1×109 CAR immunoresponsive cells, from about 5×105 to about 5×108 CAR immunoresponsive cells, or from about 1×106 to about 1×107 CAR immunoresponsive cells. However, the number of CAR immunoresponsive cells administered to a subject will vary between wide limits, depending upon the location, source, identity, extent and severity of the cancer, the age and condition of the individual to be treated etc. A physician will ultimately determine appropriate dosages to be used. Tumor-targeting molecules are administered to a subject prior to, or concurrent with, or after administration of the CAR immunoresponsive cells. The tumor-targeting molecules bind to target cells in the subject by association to a tumor-associated antigen or a tumor-specific antigen. The tumor-targeting molecules may be formulated for administration to a subject using techniques known to the skilled artisan. Formulations of the tumor-targeting molecules may include pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s). Examples of generally used excipients include, without limitation: saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water-for-injection, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof, stabilizing agents, solubilizing agents and surfactants, buffers and preservatives, tonicity agents bulking agents, and lubricating agents. The tumor-targeting molecules may be administered to a subject using modes and techniques known to the skilled artisan. Exemplary modes include, but are not limited to, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intratumoral injection. Other modes include, without limitation, intradermal, subcutaneous (S.C., s.q., sub-Q, Hypo), intramuscular (i.m.), intra-arterial, intramedullary, intracardiac, intra-articular (joint), intrasynovial (joint fluid area), intracranial, intraspinal, and intrathecal (spinal fluids). In some cases, a CAR-T may be locally administered at a tumor lesion, such as a liver lesion. Any known device useful for parenteral injection or infusion of the formulations can be used to effect such administration. Formulations comprising the tumor-targeting molecules are administered to a subject in an amount that is effective for treating and/or prophylaxis of the specific indication or disease. In general, formulations comprising at least about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the tumor-targeting molecules are administered to a subject in need of treatment. In most cases, the dosage is from about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the tagged proteins daily, taking into account the routes of administration, symptoms, etc. A physician will determine appropriate dosages to be used. In one embodiment, a chimeric antigen receptor is used for stimulating an immunoresponsive cell-mediated immune response. For example, a T cell-mediated immune response is an immune response that involves the activation of T cells. Activated antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells are able to induce apoptosis in target cells displaying epitopes of foreign antigens on their surface, such as for example cancer cells displaying tumor antigens. In another embodiment, a chimeric antigen receptor is used to provide anti-tumor immunity in the mammal Due to a T cell-mediated immune response the subject will develop an anti-tumor immunity. In certain cases, methods of treating a subject having cancer can involve administering to a subject in need of treatment one or more formulations of tumor-targeting molecules, wherein these molecules bind to a cancer cell, and administering one or more therapeutically-effective populations of subject CAR immunoresponsive cells, wherein the CAR immunoresponsive cells can bind the tumor-targeting molecules and induce cancer cell death. Another embodiment can relate to methods of treating a subject having cancer comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment one or more therapeutically-effective populations of subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, wherein the CAR immunoresponsive cells bind to a cancer cell, thereby inducing cancer cell death. Administration frequencies of both formulations comprising anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells and anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in combination with tumor-targeting molecules will vary depending on factors that include the disease being treated, the elements comprising the CAR immunoresponsive cells and the tumor-targeting molecules, and the modes of administration. Each formulation may be independently administered 4, 3, 2, or once daily, every other day, every third day, every fourth day, every fifth day, every sixth day, once weekly, every eight days, every nine days, every ten days, bi-weekly, monthly and bi-monthly.

In some cases, immunostimulatory agents can also be included, including, but not limited to, interleukins, e.g. IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-11, as well as the other interleukins, the colony stimulating factors, such as G-, M- and GM-CSF, interferons, e.g. .gamma.-interferon and erythropoietin. In some cases, a subject can be treated with a CAR-T, immunodepletant, and immunostimulant. A subject can be treated with IL-2 to boost performance of a CAR-T cellular product. In some cases, an immunostimulant can be a recombinant protein. An immunostimulant can also comprise an active portion of a protein. In some cases, an immunostimulant may only comprise a portion of a protein. A portion of a protein can be from about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or up to about 100% of a protein. Compositions comprising subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as CAR T cells, can be conveniently provided as sterile liquid preparations, e.g., isotonic aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, dispersions, or viscous compositions, which may be buffered to a selected pH. Liquid preparations are normally easier to prepare than gels, other viscous compositions, and solid compositions. Additionally, liquid compositions are somewhat more convenient to administer, especially by injection. Viscous compositions, on the other hand, can be formulated within the appropriate viscosity range to provide longer contact periods with specific tissues. Liquid or viscous compositions can comprise carriers, which can be a solvent or dispersing medium containing, for example, water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like) and suitable mixtures thereof. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating genetically modified CAR immunoresponsive cells utilized in practicing the present invention in a required amount of the appropriate solvent with various amounts of the other ingredients, as desired. Such compositions may be in admixture with a suitable carrier, diluent, or excipient such as sterile water, physiological saline, glucose, dextrose, or the like. The compositions can also be lyophilized. The compositions can contain auxiliary substances such as wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agents (e.g., methylcellulose), pH buffering agents, gelling or viscosity enhancing additives, preservatives, flavoring agents, colors, and the like, depending upon the route of administration and the preparation desired. Standard texts, such as “REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE”, 17th edition, 1985, incorporated herein by reference, may be consulted to prepare suitable preparations, without undue experimentation. Various additives which may enhance stability and sterility of the compositions, including antimicrobial preservatives, antioxidants, chelating agents, and buffers, can be added. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. According to the present invention, however, any vehicle, diluent, or additive used would have to be compatible with the genetically modified CAR immunoresponsive cells or their progenitors. In some cases, compositions can be isotonic, i.e., they can have the same osmotic pressure as blood and lacrimal fluid. The desired isotonicity of the compositions of this invention may be accomplished using sodium chloride, or other pharmaceutically acceptable agents such as dextrose, boric acid, sodium tartrate, propylene glycol or other inorganic or organic solutes. Sodium chloride is preferred particularly for buffers containing sodium ions. Viscosity of compositions, if desired, can be maintained at the selected level using a pharmaceutically acceptable thickening agent. Methylcellulose is preferred because it is readily and economically available and is easy to work with. Other suitable thickening agents include, for example, xanthan gum, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carbomer, and the like. The preferred concentration of the thickener will depend upon the agent selected. The important point is to use an amount that will achieve the selected viscosity. Obviously, the choice of suitable carriers and other additives will depend on the exact route of administration and the nature of the particular dosage form, e.g., liquid dosage form (e.g., whether the composition is to be formulated into a solution, a suspension, gel or another liquid form, such as a time release form or liquid-filled form). In some cases, for example, in the compositions, formulations and methods of treating cancer, the unit dosage of the composition or formulation administered can be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 or 100 mg. In some cases, the total amount of the composition or formulation administered can be 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 g. In some cases, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as a CAR T cell, can be administered either alone or together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, by any routes, and such administration can be carried out in both single and multiple dosages. More particularly, the pharmaceutical composition can be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hand candies, powders, sprays, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, such oral pharmaceutical formulations can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored by means of various agents of the type commonly employed for such purposes. For example, cells can be administered to a patient in conjunction with (e.g., before, simultaneously, or following) any number of relevant treatment modalities, including but not limited to treatment with agents such as antiviral therapy, cidofovir and interleukin-2, or Cytarabine (also known as ARA-C). In some cases, the engineered cells can be used in combination with chemotherapy, radiation, immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporin, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and FK506, antibodies, or other immunoablative agents such as CAMPATH, anti-CD3 antibodies or other antibody therapies, cytoxin, fludaribine, cyclosporin, FK506, rapamycin, mycoplienolic acid, steroids, FR901228, cytokines, and irradiation. The engineered cell composition can also be administered to a patient in conjunction with (e.g., before, simultaneously or following) bone marrow transplantation, T cell ablative therapy using either chemotherapy agents such as, fludarabine, external-beam radiation therapy (XRT), cyclophosphamide, or antibodies such as OKT3 or CAMPATH. In some cases, the engineered cell compositions can be administered following B-cell ablative therapy such as agents that react with CD20, e.g., Rituxan. For example, subjects can undergo standard treatment with high dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. In certain embodiments, following the transplant, subjects can receive an infusion of the engineered cells, e.g., expanded engineered cells. Additionally, expanded engineered cells can be administered before or following surgery. The engineered cells obtained by any one of the methods described herein can be used for treating patients in need thereof against Host versus Graft (HvG) rejection and Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). Therefore, a method of treating patients in need thereof against Host versus Graft (HvG) rejection and Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) comprising treating said patient by administering to said patient an effective amount of engineered cells comprising inactivated TCR alpha and/or TCR beta genes can be contemplated. Kits Disclosed herein can be kits comprising compositions. Disclosed herein can also be kits for the treatment or prevention of a cancer, pathogen infection, immune disorder or allogeneic transplant.

In some cases, a kit may contain cyclophosphamide and/or fludarabine, formulated for administration to a subject in need thereof at about 60 mg/kg to about 80 mg/kg and at about 25 mg/m2 to about 35 mg/m2, respectively. In some cases a kit may contain products at a pediatric dosage. Recombinant methods are well known in the art. The practice of the invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology (including recombinant techniques), microbiology, cell biology, biochemistry and immunology, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature, such as, “Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual”, second edition (Sambrook et al., 1989); “Oligonucleotide Synthesis” (Gait, ed., 1984); “Animal Cell Culture” (Freshney, ed., 1987); “Methods in Enzymology” (Academic Press, Inc.); “Handbook of Experimental Immunology” (Wei & Blackwell, eds.); “Gene Transfer Vectors for Mammalian Cells” (Miller & Calos, eds., 1987); “Current Protocols in Molecular Biology” (Ausubel et al., eds., 1987); “PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction”, (Mullis et al., eds., 1994); and “Current Protocols in Immunology” (Coligan et al., eds., 1991). These techniques are applicable to the production of the polynucleotides and polypeptides, and, as such, can be considered in making and practicing the invention. Particularly useful techniques for are discussed in the sections that follow. Additional Applications Effective adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapies (ACT) can be useful to treat cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer) patients. For example, autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) can be modified using non-viral or viral methods disclosed herein to express an anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes GPC3 on cancer or tumor cells and can be used in the disclosed methods and kits. The present invention can be directed to compositions and methods for immunotherapy, including but not limited to cancer, using a human or humanized chimeric antigen receptor following or concurrent with a lymphocyte reduction treatment to a subject. This chimeric antigen receptor makes use of human or humanized chimeric antigen receptor constructs following or concurrent with a lymphocyte reduction treatment to a subject. These compositions and methods can provide a cancer therapy with many advantages. In some cases, a method can include modifying immunoresponsive cells to render the immunoresponsive cells substantially non-dependent upon the presence or activity of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In some cases, a polynucleic acid described herein can encode for a chimeric antigen receptor. Also disclosed are methods of making immunoresponsive cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors, such as anti-GPC3 CAR. Disclosed can also be a method of treatment in which patients with a cancer or disease can be administered anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. Described herein is a method of treating a disease (e.g., cancer) in a recipient comprising transplanting to the recipient one or more subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells following or concurrently with lymphocyte reduction treatment. Autologous lymphocyte infusion can be used in a treatment. Autologous peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) can be collected from a patient in need of treatment and T cells can be activated and expanded using methods described herein and known in the art and then infused back into the patient. In other cases, allogenic cells can be used to treat a patient. Populations of subject CAR immunoresponsive cells may be formulated for administration; and wherein the administration to a subject using techniques known to the skilled artisan. Expanded cells can then be grown under conditions similar to those for unmodified cells, whereby the modified ceils can be expanded and used for a variety of purposes. The method disclosed herein can comprise transplanting. Transplantation can refer to adoptive transplantation of a cellular product. Transplanting can be autotransplanting, allotransplanting, xenotransplanting, or any other transplanting. For example, transplanting can be xenotransplanting. Transplanting can also be allotransplanting. In some cases, about 5×1010 subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells are administered to a subject. In some embodiments, about 5×1010 cells represents a median amount of cells administered to a subject. In some embodiments, about 5×1010 cells are necessary to affect a therapeutic response in a subject. In some embodiments, at least about at least about 1×107 cells, at least about 2×107 cells, at least about 3×107 cells, at least about 4×107 cells, at least about 5×107 cells, at least about 6×107 cells, at least about 6×107 cells, at least about 8×107 cells, at least about 9×107 cells, at least about 1×108 cells, at least about 2×108 cells, at least about 3×108 cells, at least about 4×108 cells, at least about 5×108 cells, at least about 6×108 cells, at least about 6×108 cells, at least about 8×108 cells, at least about 9×108 cells, at least about 1×109 cells, at least about 2×109 cells, at least about 3×109 cells, at least about 4×109 cells, at least about 5×109 cells, at least about 6×109 cells, at least about 6×109 cells, at least about 8×109 cells, at least about 9×109 cells, at least about 1×1010 cells, at least about 2×1010 cells, at least about 3×1010 cells, at least about 4×1010 cells, at least about 5×1010 cells, at least about 6×1010 cells, at least about 6×1010 cells, at least about 8×1010 cells, at least about 9×1010 cells, at least about 1×1011 cells, at least about 2×1011 cells, at least about 3×1011 cells, at least about 4×1011 cells, at least about 5×1011 cells, at least about 6×1011 cells, at least about 6×1011 cells, at least about 8×1011 cells, at least about 9×1011 cells, or at least about 1×1012 cells. For example, about 5×1010 cells may be administered to a subject. In another example, starting with 3×106 cells, the cells may be expanded to about 5×1010 cells and administered to a subject. In some cases, cells are expanded to sufficient numbers for therapy. For example, 5×107 cells can undergo rapid expansion to generate sufficient numbers for therapeutic use. In some cases, sufficient numbers for therapeutic use can be 5×1010. Any number of cells can be infused for therapeutic use. For example, a subject may be infused with a number of cells between 1×106 to 5×1012 inclusive. A patient may be infused with as many cells that can be generated for them. In some cases, cells that are infused into a patient are not all engineered. For example, at least 90% of cells that are infused into a patient can be engineered. In other instances, at least 40% of cells that are infused into a patient can be engineered. In some embodiments, a method can comprise calculating and/or administering to a subject an amount of engineered cells necessary to affect a therapeutic response in the subject. In some embodiments, calculating the amount of engineered cells necessary to affect a therapeutic response comprises the viability of the cells and/or the efficiency with which an anti-GPC3 CAR transgene has been integrated into the genome of a cell. In some embodiments, in order to affect a therapeutic response in a subject, the cells administered to the subject may be viable cells. In some embodiments, in order to effect a therapeutic response in a subject, at least about 95%, at least about 90%, at least about 85%, at least about 80%, at least about 75%, at least about 70%, at least about 65%, at least about 60%, at least about 55%, at least about 50%, at least about 45%, at least about 40%, at least about 35%, at least about 30%, at least about 25%, at least about 20%, at least about 15%, at least about 10% of the cells are viable cells. In some embodiments, in order to affect a therapeutic response in a subject, the cells administered to a subject may be cells that have had one or more transgenes successfully integrated into the genome of the cell. In some embodiments, in order to effect a therapeutic response in a subject, at least about 95%, at least about 90%, at least about 85%, at least about 80%, at least about 75%, at least about 70%, at least about 65%, at least about 60%, at least about 55%, at least about 50%, at least about 45%, at least about 40%, at least about 35%, at least about 30%, at least about 25%, at least about 20%, at least about 15%, at least about 10% of the cells have had one or more CAR transgenes successfully integrated into a genome of a cell. In some cases, a subject can be administered subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, wherein CAR immunoresponsive cells that can be administered may be about 1 to about 35 days old. For example, administered cells may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, or up to about 40 days old. An age of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be considered from a time of stimulation. An age of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be considered from a time of apheresis. An age of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be considered from a time of transduction. In some embodiments, CAR immunoresponsive cell that can be administered to a subject are about 10 to about 14 or about 20 days old. In some cases, an “age” of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be determined by a length of a telomere. For example, a “young” CAR immunoresponsive cell can have a longer telomere length than an “exhausted” or “old” CAR immunoresponsive cell. Without being bound to a particular theory, it can be believed that immunoresponsive cells lose an estimated telomere length of about 0.8 kb per week in culture, and that young CAR immunoresponsive cell cultures can have telomeres that are about 1.4 kb longer than immunoresponsive cells that are about 44 days old. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that longer telomere lengths can be associated with positive objective clinical responses in patients and persistence of the cells in vivo. In some cases, cells are isolated from the subject organism, transfected with a nucleic acid (e.g., gene or cDNA), and re-infused back into the subject organism (e.g., patient). Cells (e.g., engineered cells or engineered primary T cells) before, after, and/or during transplantation can be functional. For example, transplanted cells can be functional for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 6, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 days after transplantation. Transplanted cells can be functional for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 months after transplantation. Transplanted cells can be functional for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 years after transplantation. In some cases, transplanted cells can be functional for up to the lifetime of a recipient. Further, transplanted cells can function at 100% of their normal intended function. Transplanted cells can also function 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or up to about 100% of their normal intended function. Transplanted cells can also function over 100% of their normal intended function. For example, transplanted cells can function 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, or up to about 5000% of their normal intended function. Transplanting can be by any type of transplanting. Sites can include, but not limited to, liver subcapsular space, splenic subcapsular space, renal subcapsular space, omentum, gastric or intestinal submucosa, vascular segment of small intestine, venous sac, testis, brain, spleen, or cornea. For example, transplanting can be subcapsular transplanting. Transplanting can also be intramuscular transplanting. Transplanting can be intraportal transplanting. After treatment (e.g., any of the treatment as disclosed herein), transplant rejection can be improved as compared to when one or more wild-type cells is transplanted into a recipient. For example, transplant rejection can be hyperacute rejection. Transplant rejection can also be acute rejection. Other types of rejection can include chronic rejection. Transplant rejection can also be cell-mediated rejection or T cell-mediated rejection. Transplant rejection can also be natural killer cell-mediated rejection. Improving transplantation can mean lessening hyperacute rejection, which can encompass a decrease, lessening, or diminishing of an undesirable effect or symptom. Transplantation can refer to adoptive transplantation of a cellular product. Another indication of successful transplantation can be the days a recipient does not require immunosuppressive therapy. For example, after treatment (e.g., transplantation) provided herein, a recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more days. This can indicate that transplantation was successful. This can also indicate that there is no rejection of the transplanted cells, tissues, and/or organs. In some cases, a recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1 day. A recipient can also require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 7 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 14 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 21 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 28 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 60 days. Furthermore, a recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more years. Another indication of successful transplantation can be the days a recipient requires reduced immunosuppressive therapy. For example, after the said treatment provided herein, a recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more days. This can indicate that transplantation was successful. This can also indicate that there is no or minimal rejection of the transplanted cells, tissues, and/or organs. For example, a recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1 day. A recipient can also require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 7 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 14 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 21 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 28 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 60 days. Furthermore, a recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more years. Reduced immunosuppressive therapy can refer to less immunosuppressive therapy compared to a required immunosuppressive therapy when one or more wild-type cells is transplanted into a recipient. Immunosuppressive therapy can comprise any treatment that suppresses the immune system. Immunosuppressive therapy can help to alleviate, minimize, or eliminate transplant rejection in a recipient. For example, immunosuppressive therapy can comprise immuno-suppressive drugs. Immunosuppressive drugs that can be used before, during and/or after transplant, but are not limited to, MMF (mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept)), ATG (anti-thymocyte globulin), anti-CD154 (CD40L), anti-CD40 (2C10, ASKP1240, CCFZ533X2201), alemtuzumab (Campath), anti-CD20 (rituximab), anti-IL-6R antibody (tocilizumab, Actemra), anti-IL-6 antibody (sarilumab, olokizumab), CTLA4-Ig (Abatacept/Orencia), belatacept (LEA29Y), sirolimus (Rapimune), everolimus, tacrolimus (Prograf), daclizumab (Ze-napax), basiliximab (Simulect), infliximab (Remicade), cyclosporin, deoxyspergualin, soluble complement receptor 1, cobra venom factor, compstatin, anti C5 antibody (eculizumab/Soliris), methylprednisolone, FTY720, everolimus, leflunomide, anti-IL-2R-Ab, rapamycin, anti-CXCR3 antibody, anti-ICOS antibody, anti-OX40 antibody, and anti-CD122 antibody. Furthermore, one or more than one immunosuppressive agents/drugs can be used together or sequentially. One or more than one immunosuppressive agents/drugs can be used for induction therapy or for maintenance therapy. The same or different drugs can be used during induction and maintenance stages. In some cases, daclizumab (Zenapax) can be used for induction therapy and tacrolimus (Prograf) and sirolimus (Rapimune) can be used for maintenance therapy. Daclizumab (Zenapax) can also be used for induction therapy and low dose tacrolimus (Prograf) and low dose sirolimus (Rapimune) can be used for maintenance therapy Immunosuppression can also be achieved using non-drug regimens including, but not limited to, whole body irradiation, thymic irradiation, and full and/or partial splenectomy. These techniques can also be used in combination with one or more immuno-suppressive drugs. EXAMPLES The invention is further described in detail by reference to the following experimental examples. These examples are provided for purposes of illustration only, and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified. Thus, the invention should in no way be construed as being limited to the following examples, but rather, should be construed to encompass any and all variations which become evident as a result of the teaching provided herein. Example 1: Construction of Anti-GPC3-CAR Vector An exemplary lentiviral plasmid vector was constructed using a third-generation of self-inactivating lentiviral vector system. The system contains packaging plasmid pMDLg RRE encoding Gag/Pol (Addgene), packaging plasmid pRSV-REV encoding Rev (Addgene), envelope plasmid pCMV-VSV-G encoding VSV-G (Addgene), and a recombinant expression vector encoding a CAR gene based in an empty vector pRRLSIN-cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE (Addgene). The system can effectively lower the risk of forming replication capable lentivirus (RCL) particles. The empty vector pRRLSIN-cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE contains a promoter of elongation factor-1 α (EF-1α), and insert MluI cleavage site between the promoter and CD8αsp signal peptide. Specifically, the pWPT-EGFP vector (Addgene) was double digested with ClaI/SalI (NEB) to recover DNA fragments of 1.1 Kb, which were then ligated with T4 DNA ligase to pRRLSIN-cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE which was double digested with ClaI/SalI. The ligation mixture was then transformed into host cell TOP10. Positive clones were identified by colony PCR and confirmed by sequencing, giving rise to recombinant plasmid pRRLSIN-cPPT.EF-1α-EGFP.WPRE. EF-1α promoter (SEQ ID NO: 33, including Mlu I cleavage site) of the CD8a signal domain (aka Fragment 1, 442 bp) was amplified with upstream primer 5′-gcaggggaaagaatagtagaca-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 31), downstream primer 5′-CGGCCTGGCGGCGTGGAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 32), and pRRLSIN-cPPT.EF-1α-EGFP.WPRE as template, and the amplification was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 30 s, annealing at 53° C. for 30 s, and extension at 68° C. for 30 s; and after 25 cycles, extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The amplified band was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis to have the expected fragment size. Humanized antibody 35 has been described in Chinese Patent Application No. CN201510481235.1, which is capable of specifically recognizing humanized GPC3 protein. To construct 35-CAR lentiviral plasmid, the following were used in amplification to provide heavy chain variable domain fragment: fragment containing heavy chain variable domain 35 (SEQ ID NO: 80 in CN201510481235.1) as template, upstream primer 5′-ctccacgccgccaggccggaggtgcagctggtgcag-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 34), and downstream primer 5′-GCGGTGTCCTCGCTCCGCAGGCTGCTCAGCTCCATGTAGGCGGTG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 35); the following were used to provide light chain variable domain fragment: fragment containing light chain variable domain of 35 (SEQ ID NO: 79 CN201510481235.1 as template, upstream primer 5′-GCGGAGCGAGGACACCGCCGTGTACTACTGCGCCCGGTTCTACAGCTAC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 36), and downstream primer 5′-CGGCGCTGGCGTCGTGGTACG TTTGATCTCCAGCTTGGTG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 37). The heavy chain and light chain variable domain primers were amplified with bridging PCR to provide 35 scFv fragment (SEQ ID NO: 38, aka Fragment 2, 765 bp), which comprises a sequence repetitive to the upstream CD8a signal peptide and the downstream hinge region. PCR amplification was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 40 s, annealing at 58° C. for 40 s; extension at 68° C. for 40 s; and after 25 cycles, an extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The amplified band was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis to have the expected fragment size. The upstream primer 5′-accacgacgccagcgccg-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 39) and downstream primer 5′-aatccagaggttgattgtcgacctagcgagggggcagggcctgc-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 40) were used, with pWPT-eGFP-F2A-GPC3-28Z as a template (See Chinese Patent Application CN 104140974 A), to amplify Hinge-28Z (SEQ ID NO: 41, Fragment 3, 703 bp) (with internal Sal I cleavage site). PCR amplification was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 30 s; annealing at 60° C. for 30 s; extension at 68° C. for 30 s; and after 25 cycles, final extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The amplified band was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis to have the expected fragment size. An equimolar amount (about 50 ng) of Fragment 1, Fragment 2 and Fragment 3 were amplified by overlap PCR under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 40 s; annealing at 60° C. for 40 s; extension at 68° C. for 140 s; and after 5 cycles, final extension at 68° C. for 10 min. DNA polymerase, upstream primer 5′-gcaggggaaagaatagtagaca-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 31) and downstream primer 5′-aatccagaggttgattgtcgacctagcgagggggcagggcctgc-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 40) were then supplemented to the mixture, and amplified for 25 cycles under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 40 s; annealing at 60° C. for 40 s; extension at 68° C. for 140 s; and final extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The theoretical size of the resulting 35-28Z (SEQ ID NO: 41) was 1874 bp. The amplified product was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and had the expected fragment size, and sequence as shown as SEQ ID NO: 23. The vector pRRLSIN-cPPT.EF-1α-EGFP.WPRE vector and 35-28Z were digested with MluI and SalI, and then ligated with T4 ligase, and transformed into TOP10. Positive clones were identified with colony PCR and sequenced by Invitrogen to confirm that pRRL-EF-1α-35-28Z was obtained. Example 2: Packaging of Anti-GPC3-CAR Lentivirus Anti-GPC3-CAR lentivirus stock solution (0.75 L) was prepared using Embryonic Kidney Cells 293 T (ATCC: CRL-11268). Specifically, 293T cells were seeded at 1.17×104/cm2 onto a 5-layer cellstack (Corning). Solution A was prepared at the day of transfection to comprise 133.2 μg of packaging plasmid pRSV-Rev, 133.2 μg of pMDLg/pRRE, 51.56 μg of pCMV-VSV-G and 111.7 μg of pRRL-EF-1α-35-28Z, by dissolving 966 μg of all the plasmid into 17 ml DMEM basal medium and gently mixing it. Solution B was prepared by dissolving 2.9 mg PEI (Polysciences) into 17 ml DMEM basal medium, and the solution was gently mixed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Solution A was then introduced into Solution B, homogenously mixed, and allowed to stand still at room temperature for 20 min to 25 min. The 293 T culture solution was then transferred from a Cellstack into a 1 L flask. The combined solution comprising plasmid and PEI was then introduced into the culture solution and mixed gently. The resulting solution was then transferred into a Cellstack, and incubated for 5 h at 37° C., 5% CO2 before the medium was changed to fresh growth medium DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technology). The culture was then incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2 for 48 h. The lentiviral stock solution was then recovered, filtered with a 0.45 μm (Millipore) filter, concentrated and purified with KrosFlo® IIi Tangential Flow Filtration System (Spectrum), and washed with AIM-V(Life technology) and stored. Titration of virus was conducted according to the method described in CN104140974A. Virus titer was calculated to be about 1×108/ml. The virus was packaged at 1×108/vial, and stored at −80° C. for later use. Example 3: Preparation of Anti-GPC3-CAR T Cells and In Vitro Anti-Tumor Assay Against Liver Cancer Cells CAR T cells were prepared in an immune cell preparatory lab following cGMP standards. Specifically, peripheral blood of subjects or white blood cell enriched blood obtained using a COBE Spectra blood component separator were separated by density gradient centrifugation to obtain human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). PBMCs were mixed with magnetic beads coated with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Life technology) at a ratio of PMBC to magnetic beads of 1:3, stimulated with recombinant human IL-2 at a final concentration of 300 U/mL (Shanghai Hua Xin High Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) and cultivated for 48 h. Subsequently, the aforementioned lentivirus was used to transduce the activated T cells at MOI of approximately 5, with efficiency of transduction enhanced by RetroNectin (Takara). 24 h and 48 h following transduction, free viruses were removed by medium change through low-speed centrifugation (100 g×10 min). 72 h following transduction, the magnetic beads were removed. The aforementioned centrifugation was repeated, and a sub-culture was obtained at a density of 5×105/mL. Subsequently, the cells were sub-cultured every other day at a density of about 3×105/mL while recombinant human IL-2 was added into the lymphocyte culture medium at a final concentration of 300 U/mL. The transduced CAR T cells were assayed for their expression of CAR by flow cytometry following in vitro cultivation for 10 to 12 days. That is, positive transduction rates of the CAR T cells were assayed and are shown in Table 7. Moreover, an in vitro anti-tumor assay was conducted by co-incubation with high GPC3 expressing liver cancer cells Huh-7, low GPC3 expressing PLC/PRF/5, and GPC3 negative SK-HEP-1 for 18 h at an effector to target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. For a detailed procedure, refer to CN104140974A. In vitro anti-tumor activity results at the effector to target ratio of 1:1 are presented in Table 8. Results show that anti-GPC3-CAR T cells expressed a CAR ranging from about 40% to about 80%. Furthermore, the anti-GPC3-CAR T cells had specific killing of GPC3 positive Huh-3 and PLC/PRF/5 with a dose dependent effect on the effector-to-target ratio, whereas they did not have killing effect on GPC3 negative SK-HEP-1 (Table 8), indicating that anti-GPC3-CAR T cells prepared from the subjects in the present disclosure have excellent targeted killing effects.

 Example 4: Change of Lymphocytes after Lymphocyte Reduction After confirmation that no abnormality occurred during anti-GPC3-CAR T cell preparation from treated subjects, the subjects were subjected to a comprehensive assessment of various physical conditions to determine whether the subjects were suitable for in vivo lymphocyte reduction. A primary lymphocyte reduction protocol was designed for administration to suitable subjects. The following two lymphocyte reduction protocols were designed: Protocol 1: cyclophosphamide (CTX) single agent lymphocyte reduction protocol, at a dose of 1 g/m2/day×1 day. Protocol 2: combined fludarabine (FLU)+cyclophosphamide lymphocyte reduction protocol, at a dose of 20˜30 mg fludarabine/m2/day×4 days+500 mg cyclophosphamide/m2/day×2 days. The protocol was implemented with adjustment to include the following conditions: calculation of human surface area was conducted according to Stevenson's formula (Chinese Journal of Physiology, 12:327, 1937). That is, surface area (m2)=0.0061×height (cm)+0.0128×weight (kg)−0.1529. For example, an adult having a height of 170 cm and a weight of 60 kg has a surface area of 1.6521 m2. Subjects not suitable for lymphocyte reduction due to existing physical conditions or on their own volition were assigned to a second queue. Different lymphocyte reduction treatments were performed on a total of three subjects (H01, H02, and H03). One subject (H04) was not subjected to ablation due to physical conditions and their volition. Protocols are presented in Table 9.

 H01′ indicates an initial administration of anti-GPC3-CAR T cell therapy to subject H01; H012 indicates a second administration of anti-GPC3-CAR T cell therapy to subject H01; and D0 was defined as the day when anti-GPC3-CAR T cell administration was conducted. Following implementation of the aforementioned lymphocyte reduction protocols, various changes occurred in the absolute values of lymphocytes in the subjects. As a result of the lymphocyte reduction treatment of cyclophosphamide as a single agent, lymphocytes decreased by about 40% to about 72%. The combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphocyte reduction yielded a more significant difference in lymphocyte reduction, at about 82% to about 96.5%, as compared to the cyclophosphamide single agent administration Specifically, FIG. 2 demonstrates the change of the ratio of the absolute number of lymphocytes to the baseline at each monitored time point before and after lymphocyte reduction treatment administration. The aforementioned results demonstrate that the combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide results in superior lymphocyte reduction as compared to the cyclophosphamide single agent reduction protocol. Example 5: Clinical Response of Subjects Following Ablation About 2 days after the implementation of lymphocyte reduction, subjects were administered anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment by intravenous administration. The doses of the administered anti-GPC3-CAR T cells are presented in Table 7. The clinical responses of the subjects following the treatment are summarized in Table 10. The results demonstrate that the three subjects that underwent lymphocyte reduction have stable disease (SD) or partial disease (PR) following the anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment up to now. In contrast, the subject H04, that did not receive the lymphocyte reduction treatment, shows progressive disease by MRI 4 weeks following the anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment. As to AFP results, the subject H02 could not be assessed for prognosis from the tumor marker due to AFP insensitivity. For two other subjects, their AFP levels somewhat decreased, as in Table 10. It should be noted that the subject H03, after lymphocyte reduction using combined fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, showed an 87% reduction of AFP as compared to the baseline before the treatment. Meanwhile, imaging shows that the target site has partial clinical response. FIG. 3 shows MRI results from subject H03 before treatment vs. 10 weeks post-treatment.

Safety data and clinical observation showed that following treatment with anti-GPC3-CAR T cells, no subjects develop intolerable toxic or side effect. All subjects had some extent of fever and GRP increase. Subjects H01 and H04 had a shiver following administration. Subject H03 had decreased albumin caused by fever. By taking exogenous nutrient and albumin, the subject had normal albumin after the fever was gone (Table 11).

 Moreover, cytokine release syndrome, which often occurs during treatment of blood cancers using CAR T cells, was not observed in this clinical study, indicating that anti-GPC3-CAR T cells are safe. In sum, the results of the clinical studies using CAR-GPC T cells to treat GPC3 positive hepatocellular cancer demonstrate that subjects with effective lymphocyte reduction were conferred with certain clinical benefits by anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment, whereas the subjects without lymphocyte reduction therapy were not conferred any clinical benefit. Further, neither of the subjects with and without lymphocyte reduction exhibited intolerable toxic or side effect, with both of them having certain adverse responses such as fever and increased CRP, indicating that the lymphocyte reduction might not have worsened the adverse response of the subjects. Further, as regards to the effect of lymphocyte reduction therapy and benefit to the subjects, the combined fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphocyte reduction protocol may be superior to the cyclophosphamide single agent lymphocyte reduction protocol. In sum, anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment following implementation of effective lymphocyte reduction may provide an effective therapeutic solution to clinical treatment of GPC3 positive hepatocellular carcinoma. Example 6: Phenotypic Analysis Expression of cell surface molecules is determined by flow cytometry using standard methodology. The following monoclonal antibodies conjugated with phycoerythrin, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and/or peridinin chlorophyll protein are used: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD30, CCR4, CD45RA, CD45RO, CCR7, CD62L, CD56, αβT-cell receptor (BD Biosciences PharMingen). Expression of CAR by T cells is detected using an anti-CAR antibody. Samples are analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences PharMingen), and data is analyzed by CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). At least 10,000 positive events are measured for each sample. Example 7: Cytotoxicity Assay: Liver Cancer To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effect of the second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells, a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was performed. Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 33-28BBZ, 92-28BBZ, and 4-28BBZ, were co-cultured with control cells, SK-HEP-1 (FIG. 4A) and CHO-K1 (FIG. 4B), at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. To evaluate anti-tumor cytotoxicity CAR-T cells, 33-28BBZ, 92-28BBZ, and 4-28BBZ, were co-cultured with GPC3-positive liver cancer cells, Huh-7, or control cells transduced to express GPC3, CHO-K1-GPC3+, at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C., FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B respectively. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. For all effector: target ratios, the cytotoxicity was obtained as the average value of 5 repetitive wells. Results Cytotoxicity data show that 33-28BBZ, 92-28BBZ, and 4-28BBZ CAR-T constructs had cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines expressing GPC3 while having no cytotoxicity to non-GPC3 expressing control lines at 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. Example 8: Cytotoxicity Assay: Liver Cancer Panel To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effect of the second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells, a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was performed. Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 92-28Z, 92-BBZ, 92-28BBZ, or mock were co-cultured with HepG2 (HCC)(FIG. 6A), Hep3B (HCC)(FIG. 6B), or PLC/PRF/5 (Hepatoma)(FIG. 6C) at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of the second and third generation CAR-T a similar CytoTox 96® assay was performed using 92-28Z, 92-BBZ, 92-28BBZ, or mock co-cultured with high GPC3 expressing liver cancer cells, Huh-7, FIG. 7A. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. Results Cytotoxicity data show that both second and third generation constructs had comparable cytotoxicity across all liver cancer panels including HCC and hepatoma tumor cell lines at 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. The second and third generation contruts were able to target tumor cells of varying levels of GPC3 expression, revealing a broad range of tumor targeting potential. Example 9: Cytotoxicity Assay: Gastric Carcinoma To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effect of the second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells in a gastric carcinoma tumor setting, a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was performed. Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 92-28Z, 92-28BBZ, or mock were co-cultured with KATO-III at effector-to-target ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. Results Cytotoxicity data shows that both second and third generation constructs had comparable cytotoxicity against the gastric carcinoma tumor line, KATO-III, FIG. 7B, which mock transduced cells had no activity. Data suggests that CAR-T cells are specific to their tumor target and show no reacticity to tissues that does not express the GPC3 antigen. Example 10: Comparison of scFv 33 Versus scFv 92 To compare CAR-T with different scFv's to GPC3, second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells were used in a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 33-28Z, 92-28Z, 92-BBZ, 92-28BBZ, or mock were co-cultured with Huh-7 cells or control cells, A431 (GPC3 neg), at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C.Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. Results Cytotoxicity data shows that constructs with the scFv 92 had increased cytotoxicy as compared to constructs with scFv 33 at 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 effector to target ratios, FIG. 10B. Cytotoxicity was antigen specific as there was no cytotoxicity detected in the cocultured with the GPC3 neg tumor cell line A431, FIG. 10A. Example 11: Comparison of Second and Third Generation CAR-T To compare second and third generation CAR-T CAR-T transduced T cells were used in a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 4-28Z, 4-28BBZ, 4-4-28BBZ, 4-14-28BBZ, 4-20-28BBZ, 4-35-28BBZ, 4-42-28BBZ or mock-transduced were co-cultured with Huh7 (HCC) cells at effector: target ratio of 3:1, or 1:1 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. Results Cytotoxicity data show that both second and third generation constructs had cytotoxicity with 4-20-28BBZ, 4-35-28BBZ, and 4-42-28BBZ having higher cycotoxicity as measured by increased lysis, FIG. 9. Example 12: Proliferation Assay Proliferation of anti-GPC3 CAR-T after exposure to target cells (Huh-7, GPC3+) or control cells (SK-HEP-1, GPC3-) is determined by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester dilution assays. One week post-transduction, control T lymphocytes and anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells are labeled with 1.5 μmol/L carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Invitrogen) and plated with irradiated tumor targets (GPC3 positive and GPC3 negative lines) at an effector-to-target (E: T) ratio of 5:1. CFSE dilution is measured on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry on day 4 of co-culture. Example 13: Patient Derived Tumor Graft Murine Model and Lymphocyte Reduction NOD/SCID mice were each implanted with 2×2×2 mm lung cancer tumors. On approximately day 27 post implantation or when tumor size, reached 220 mm3, mice were administered cyclophosphamide intravenously and either 1×107 mock, hu92-28Z, or hu92-28BBZ CAR-T cells intraperitonealy. A second administration followed on day 34. Tumor volume was measured using caliper measurement approximately every 3-7 days until day 52 post tumor inoculation. Results On day 51 post tumor inoculation, mice treated with 92-28Z, second generation CAR-T, had significantly reduced tumor size as compared to mice treated with 92-28BBZ, third generation CAR-T, or saline, FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B. Mice treated with 92-28Z, second generation CAR-T, also had significantly reduced tumor weight as compared to mice treated with 92-28BBZ, third generation CAR-T, or saline, FIG. 8C. Mice treated with 92-28Z, second generation CAR-T, also had significantly reduced inhibition as compared to mice treated with 92-28BBZ, third generation CAR-T, or saline, FIG. 8D. Example 14: Xenograft HCC Murine Model 8- to 12-week old NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtmlWjl/SzJ (NSG) mice (Bar Harbor, Me.) were implanted with 0.5×106 Huh-7 tumor cells on their left flank. 7 days post tumor inoculation mice were treated with 1×107 mock-transduced T cells, hu92-28Z, or hu92-28BBZ by tail vein injection. Following treatment mice were monitored by caliper measurement at least once a week for 35 days post tumor cell inoculation. Results Treatment with hu92-28Z and hu92-28BBZ had significant anti-tumor activity as compared to mice treated with mock-transduced T cells. FIG. 11A shows that mice treated with hu92-28Z or hu92-28BBZ had significantly reduced tumor volume on day 35 post tumor cell inoculation. FIG. 11B shows that mice treated with hu92-28Z or hu92-28BBZ had significantly smaller tumors as evidenced by their reduced weight measurements as compared to mice treated with mock transduced cells. FIG. 11C shows images of the xenograft tumors. Example 15: Clinical Expansion of Anti-GPC3 CAR T Cells In order to generate a large number of transduced T cells, the cells are induced to proliferate using a rapid expansion protocol (REP). Prior to being used in REPs, T cells are started in culture with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and IL-2 and transduced on the second day after the initiation of culture as detailed above. The cells are cultured in a 75 cm2 flask at 37° C. and 5% CO2. The cells are counted and suspended at a concentration of 0.5×106 cells/mL in fresh T cell medium with 300 IU/mL of IL-2 every two days for the remainder of the time they will be kept in culture. Example 16: Clinical Trial Patients with evaluable liver cancer undergo apheresis to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Lymphocytes are isolated, virally transduced with an anti-GPC3 CAR, expanded, and aliquots taken for immunologic testing. On days −7 and −6 before CAR-T administration, patients undergo a preparative regime of cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg/day×2 days IV over 1 hr. On days −7 and −3 before CAR-T administration, patients undergo a preparative regime of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day IVPB daily over 30 minutes for 5 days. During the preparative regimen, patients undergo daily complete blood count (CBC) testing. In the first part of a phase I study a dose escalation is initiated utilizing one patient per group starting at 109 anti-GPC3 CAR-T per patient. Individual patients are treated at half log increments. Thus the following doses will be utilized: 109, 3×109 cells, 1010 cells, 3×1010 cells, and up to 1×1011 cells. Autologous anti-GPC3 CAR-T are administered intravenously over 20 to 30 minutes via non-filtered tubing. All patients return to the clinic for evaluation 6 weeks following administration of the CAR-T cell product.

In 2016, an estimated 1,685,210 new cases of cancer will be diagnosed in the United States alone, and 595,690 people will die from the disease. By 2020, 18.2 million Americans, roughly 1 in 19 people, will be cancer patients or cancer survivors, up from 11.7 million (1 in 26) in 2005, according to the Journal of Oncology Practice (Erikson 2007). Chimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are recombinant receptors for antigen, which, in a single molecule, redirect the specificity and function of T cells and other immune cells. Their use in cancer immunotherapy can be to rapidly generate tumor-targeted T cells, bypassing the obstacles of active immunization. Once expressed in cells, the CAR-modified cell may exert both immediate and long-term effects in a subject. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy, which edits a cancer patient's T cells to recognize their tumors, has shown to be effective for treating blood cancers. In recent clinical trials, CAR T cell therapy has dramatically improved the outcomes of blood cancer patients with advanced, otherwise untreatable forms of leukemia and lymphoma. In contract, CAR T cells face a unique set of challenges in the context of solid tumors. Amongst the challenges include the identification of an antigen whose expression clearly demarcates tumor from normal tissue and establishing effective killing of tumor cells within a tumor and hence reduction of tumor size. ",,"There exists a pressing need for alternative and effective treatment for a wide variety of solid tumors. The present invention addresses this need and provides related advantages as well. Accordingly, the present invention discloses a method of treating a subject exhibiting a solid tumor that can express Glypican-3 (GPC3). In some cases, the method can comprise administering anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor immunoresponsive cells to a subject. In some cases, an administration can take place after or concurrent with subjecting a subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, immunoresponsive cells can be NK cells (anti-GPC3-CAR NK cells) or T cells (anti-GPC3-CAR T cells). In some cases, an administration of anti-GPC3-CAR T cells to a subject can take place after subjecting a subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, at least about 5×104 anti-GPC3-CAR T cells/kg can be administered to a subject. In some cases, from about 5×104 to about 1×1012 anti-GPC3-CAR T cells/kg are administered to a subject. An administration can be effective in reducing tumor size by at least 30% as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scan. In some cases, an administration can be effective in stabilizing tumor size as measured by a less than 10% change in a baseline measurement of a diameter of a tumor lesion as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scan. In some cases, administering of anti-GPC3-CAR T cells and a subjecting a subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment can synergistically increase a subject's medium survival time by at least about 6 months as compared to administering anti-GPC3-CAR T cells alone. In some cases, a solid tumor can be liver cancer, stomach cancer, thyroid cancer (e.g., thyroid carcinoma), lung cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, liposarcoma, testicular nonseminomatous germ cell cancer, melanoma, adenoma of the adrenal gland, schwannoma, malignant fibrous histiocytoma, or esophageal cancer. In some cases, an anit-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor can comprise an antigen binding unit that can exhibit specific binding to a C-terminus of GPC3. In some cases, an antigen binding unit can comprise a sequence exhibiting at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% sequence homology to SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, or SEQ ID NO: 8. In some cases, an anti-GPC3-CAR can comprise a sequence exhibiting at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% sequence identity to SEQ ID NO: 14, SEQ ID NO: 15, SEQ ID NO: 16, SEQ ID NO: 17, SEQ ID NO: 18, SEQ ID NO: 19, SEQ ID NO: 20, SEQ ID NO: 21, SEQ ID NO: 22, SEQ ID NO: 23, SEQ ID NO: 24, SEQ ID NO: 25, SEQ ID NO: 26, SEQ ID NO: 27, SEQ ID NO: 28, SEQ ID NO: 29, or SEQ ID NO: 30. An anti-GPC3-CAR can comprise a sequence exhibiting at least 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% sequence identity to any one of SEQ ID NOS 28 to 30. In some cases, anti-GPC3-CAR T cells can comprise at least two intracellular signaling domains. In some cases, anti-GPC3-CAR T cells can comprise at least three intracellular signaling domains. Intracellular signaling domains can be selected from a signaling domain derived from CD3, CD28, 4-1BB, OX40, DAP10, or ICOS. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can comprise reducing a quantity of regulatory T cells in a subject. Reducing a quantity of regulatory T cells can comprise a reduction of at least about 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 95% or higher, of regulatory T cells as measured by flow cytometric analysis of circulating CD4+ and CD25+ cells in a subject. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can comprise administering radiation or a biological agent to a subject. A lymphocyte reduction treatment can also comprise administering chemotherapy to a subject. An administration of chemotherapy to a subject can comprise administering a chemotherapeutic agent selected from the group consisting of cyclophosphamide, fludarabine, etoposide, cytarabine, methotrexate, vincristine, adriamycin, and any combination thereof. In some cases, a chemotherapeutic agent can be administered to a subject at least one time prior to administration of anti-GPC3-CAR T cells. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can reduce a quantity of lymphocytes by at least about 20% as measured by complete blood count (CBC) analysis. Disclosed herein can also be a method further comprising a second administration of anti-GPC3-CAR T cells to a subject. In some cases, a subject can have refractory, persistent, or progressive disease. Anti-GPC3-CAR T cells can be autologous or allogenic to a subject.

BRIEF ","The following description and examples illustrate embodiments of the disclosure in detail. It is to be understood that this disclosure is not limited to the particular embodiments described herein and as such can vary. Those of skill in the art will recognize that there are numerous variations and modifications of the disclosure, which are encompassed within its scope. Unless otherwise indicated, any embodiment can be combined with any other embodiment. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, some inventive embodiments herein contemplate numerical ranges. A variety of aspects of this invention can be presented in a range format. It should be understood that the description in range format is merely for convenience and brevity and should not be construed as an inflexible limitation on the scope of the invention. Accordingly, the description of a range should be considered to have specifically disclosed all the possible subranges as well as individual numerical values within that range as if explicitly written out. For example, description of a range such as from 1 to 6 should be considered to have specifically disclosed subranges such as from 1 to 3, from 1 to 4, from 1 to 5, from 2 to 4, from 2 to 6, from 3 to 6 etc., as well as individual numbers within that range, for example, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. This applies regardless of the breadth of the range. When ranges are present, the ranges include the range endpoints. Definitions As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, the article “a” means one or more unless explicitly otherwise provided for. As used herein, unless otherwise indicated, terms such as “contain,” “containing,” “include,” “including,” and the like mean “comprising”. The term “activation” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a process whereby a cell transitions from a resting state to an active state. This process can comprise a response to an antigen, migration, and/or a phenotypic or genetic change to a functionally active state. For example, the term “activation” can refer to the stepwise process of T cell activation. For example, a T cell can require at least two signals to become fully activated. The first signal can occur after engagement of a TCR by the antigen-MHC complex, and the second signal can occur by engagement of co-stimulatory molecules (Table 3). Anti-CD3 can mimic the first signal and anti-CD28 can mimic the second signal in vitro. For example, an engineered T cell can be activated by an expressed CAR. T cell activation” or T cell triggering, as used herein, can refer to the state of a T cell that has been sufficiently stimulated to induce detectable cellular proliferation, cytokine production and/or detectable effector function. The term “antigen binding unit” as used herein refers to an immunoglobulin molecule and immunologically active portions of immunoglobulin molecule, i.e., a molecule that contains an antigen-binding site which specifically binds (“immunoreacts with”) an antigen. Also encompassed within the term “antigen binding unit” are immunoglobulin molecules of a variety of species origins including invertebrates and vertebrates. Structurally, the simplest naturally occurring antibody (e.g., IgG) comprises four polypeptide chains, two heavy (H) chains and two light (L) chains inter-connected by disulfide bonds. The immunoglobulins represent a large family of molecules that include several types of molecules, such as IgD, IgG, IgA, IgM and IgE. The term “immunoglobulin molecule” includes, for example, hybrid antibodies, or altered antibodies, and fragments thereof. It has been shown that the antigen binding function of an antibody can be performed by fragments of a naturally-occurring antibody. These fragments are collectively termed “antigen-binding units”. Also encompassed within the term “antigen binding unit” is any polypeptide chain-containing molecular structure that has a specific shape which fits to and recognizes an epitope, where one or more non-covalent binding interactions stabilize the complex between the molecular structure and the epitope. An antigen binding unit “specifically binds to” or “immunoreactive with” an antigen if it binds with greater affinity or avidity than it binds to other reference antigens including polypeptides or other substances. “Antigen” as used herein means a substance that is recognized and bound specifically by an antigen binding unit. Antigens can include peptides, proteins, glycoproteins, polysaccharides, and lipids; portions thereof and combinations thereof. Non-limiting exemplary antigen included GPC3 from human, murine, and other homologues thereof. “Antigen” can also refer to a molecule that provokes the immune response. This immune response may involve either antibody production, or the activation of specific immunologically-competent cells, or both. The skilled artisan will understand that any macromolecule, including virtually all proteins or peptides, can serve as an antigen. The term “immunoglobulin” or “Ig”, as used herein can refer to a class of proteins, which function as antibodies. Antibodies expressed by B cells are sometimes referred to as the chimeric antigen receptor or antigen receptor. The five members included in this class of proteins are IgA, IgG, IgM, IgD, and IgE, of which IgG is the most common circulating antibody. It is the most efficient immunoglobulin in agglutination, complement fixation, and other antibody responses, and is important in defense against bacteria and viruses. For example, a tumor cell antigen can be recognized by a CAR. The term “anti-GPC3 antibody” can refer to an antibody or antibody binding site that is capable of binding GPC3 with sufficient affinity such that the antibody is useful for distinguishing GPC3 from other antigens expressed by a cell. In one embodiment, the extent of binding of an anti-GPC3 antibody to an unrelated, non-GPC3 protein is less than about 10% of the binding of the antibody to GPC3 as measured, e.g., by a radioimmunoassay (RIA). In certain embodiments, an antibody that binds to GPC3 can have a dissociation constant (Kd) of <1 μM, <100 nM, <10 nM, <5 nM, <4 nM, <3 nM, <2 nM, <1 nM, <0.1 nM, <0.01 nM, or <0.001 nM (e.g., 10−8M or less, e.g. from 10−8 M to 10−13 M, e.g., from 10−9M to 10−13 M). In certain embodiments, an anti-GPC3 antibody binds to an epitope of GPC3 that is conserved among GPC3 from different species. The term “autologous” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to as originating from the same being. For example, a sample (e.g., cells) can be removed, processed, and given back to the same subject (e.g., patient) at a later time. An autologous process is distinguished from an allogenic process where the donor and the recipient are different subjects. “Xenotransplantation” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can encompass any procedure that involves transplantation, implantation, or infusion of cells, tissues, or organs into a recipient, where the recipient and donor are different species. Transplantation of the cells, organs, and/or tissues described herein can be used for xenotransplantation in into humans. Xenotransplantation includes but is not limited to vascularized xenotransplant, partially vascularized xenotransplant, unvascularized xenotransplant, xenodressings, xenobandages, and xenostructures. “Allotransplantation” and its grammatical equivalents (e.g., allogenic transplantation) as used herein can encompass any procedure that involves transplantation, implantation, or infusion of cells, tissues, or organs into a recipient, where the recipient and donor are the same species but different individuals. Transplantation of the cells, organs, and/or tissues described herein can be used for allotransplantation into humans. Allotransplantation includes but is not limited to vascularized allotransplant, partially vascularized allotransplant, unvascularized allotransplant, allodressings, allobandages, and allostructures. “Autotransplantation” and its grammatical equivalents (e.g., autologous transplantation) as used herein can encompass any procedure that involves transplantation, implantation, or infusion of cells, tissues, or organs into a recipient, where the recipient and donor is the same individual. Transplantation of the cells, organs, and/or tissues described herein can be used for autotransplantation into humans. Autotransplantation includes but is not limited to vascularized autotransplantation, partially vascularized autotransplantation, unvascularized autotransplantation, autodressings, autobandages, and autostructures. The term “chimeric antigen receptor” or “CAR” as used herein refers to an engineered molecule, which can be expressed by an immune cell including but not limited to T cells. CAR when expressed in T cells and can redirect T cells to induce killing of a target cell with a specificity dictated by the artificial receptor. The CAR's extracellular binding domain can be derived from a murine, humanized, or fully human monoclonal antibody. An “anti-GPC3-CAR” is a CAR that is capable of binding to GPC3. The term “epitope” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a part of an antigen that can be recognized by antibodies, B cells, T cells or engineered cells. For example, an epitope can be a cancer epitope that is recognized by a TCR. Multiple epitopes within an antigen can also be recognized. The epitope can also be mutated. The term “engineered” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to one or more alterations of a nucleic acid, e.g., the nucleic acid within an organism's genome. The term “engineered” can refer to alterations, additions, and/or deletion of genes. An engineered cell can also refer to a cell with an added, deleted and/or altered gene. The term “cell” or “engineered cell” and their grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a cell of human or non-human animal origin. An engineered cell can also refer to a CAR-expressing cell. The term “good manufacturing practices” (GMP) and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to products that are safe, effective, or pure according to the FDA. GMP can also sometimes be referred to as “cGMP”. The “c” stands for “current.” Manufacturers of a product can employ technologies and systems which are up-to-date in order to comply with regulation of GMP products. GMP compatible products are typically utilized in the clinical setting as opposed to the research setting. The term “transfection” as used herein refers to the introduction of foreign nucleic acid into eukaryotic cells. Transfection may be accomplished by a variety of means known to the art including calcium phosphate-DNA co-precipitation, DEAE-dextran-mediated transfection, polybrene-mediated transfection, electroporation, microinjection, liposome fusion, lipofection, protoplast fusion, retroviral infection, and biolistics. The term “stable transfection” or “stably transfected” refers to the introduction and integration of foreign nucleic acid, DNA or RNA, into the genome of the transfected cell. The term “stable transfectant” refers to a cell which has stably integrated foreign DNA into the genomic DNA. As used herein, the terms “nucleic acid molecule encoding,” “DNA sequence encoding,” and “DNA encoding” refer to the order or sequence of deoxyribonucleotides along a strand of deoxyribonucleic acid. The order of these deoxyribonucleotides determines the order of amino acids along the polypeptide (protein) chain. The nucleic acid sequence thus codes for the amino acid sequence. The term “subject”, as used herein, refers to any animal, e.g., a mammal or marsupial. Subjects of the present invention include but are not limited to humans, non-human primates (e.g., rhesus or other types of macaques), mice, pigs, horses, donkeys, cows, sheep, rats and fowl of any kind. The term “recipient” and their grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a human or non-human animal in receipt of a therapy or treatment. The term “peripheral blood lymphocytes” (PBL) and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to lymphocytes that circulate in the blood (e.g., peripheral blood). Peripheral blood lymphocytes can refer to lymphocytes that are not localized to organs. Peripheral blood lymphocytes can comprise T cells, NK cells, B cell, or any combinations thereof. The term “immunoresponsive cell” can refer to a cell that can elicit an immune response, including but not limited to T cells, B cells, and NKT cells, their respective precursor cells and progeny thereof. An immunoresponsive cell can also refer to a cell of a lymphoid or myeloid lineage. The term “T cell” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to a T cell from any origin. For example, a T cell can be a primary T cell, e.g., an autologous T cell, a cell line, etc. The T cell can also be human or non-human. The term “T cell activation” or “T cell triggering” and its grammatical equivalents as used herein can refer to the state of a T cell that has been sufficiently stimulated to induce detectable cellular proliferation, cytokine production and/or detectable effector function. In some cases, “full T cell activation” can be similar to triggering T cell cytotoxicity. T cell activation can be measured using various assays known in the art. Said assays can be an ELISA to measure cytokine secretion, an ELISPOT, flow cytometry assays to measure intracellular cytokine expression (CD107), flow cytometry assays to measure proliferation, and cytotoxicity assays (51Cr release assay) to determine target cell elimination. Said assays typically use controls (non-engineered cells) to compare to engineered cells (CAR T) to determine relative activation of an engineered cell compared to a control. Additionally, said assays can compare engineered cells incubated or put in contact with a target cell not expressing the target antigen. For example, said comparison can be a CD19-CAR T cell incubated with a target cell that does not express CD19. The term “sequence” and its grammatical equivalents when used to refer to a nucleotide sequence, can encompass DNA or RNA; and can be either single-stranded or double stranded. A nucleic acid sequence can be mutated. A nucleic acid sequence can be of any length, for example, between 2 and 1,000,000 or more nucleotides in length (or any integer value there between or there above), e.g., between about 100 and about 10,000 nucleotides or between about 200 and about 500 nucleotides. Methods of Use In one aspect, disclosed herein are methods of treating a subject exhibiting a solid tumor that expresses Glypican-3 (GPC3). A subject method typically comprises the step of administering anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor immunoresponsive cells to a subject, wherein the administering takes place after or concurrent with subjecting the subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment. Subjects treated by methods disclosed herein can exhibit a cancer or a solid tumor. Often, cancer cells or solid tumor cells express one or more tumor antigens. Typically, the tumor antigen is Glypican-3 (GPC3). A subject exhibiting a cancer or solid tumor expressing GPC-3 can be referred to as exhibiting a GPC3-positive cancer. Cancers that express GPC3 include but are not limited to liver cancer, stomach cancer, esophageal cancer, lung cancer, breast cancer, head and neck cancer, ovarian cancer, kidney cancer, bladder cancer, cervical cancer, pancreatic cancer, liposarcoma, testicular noneminomatous germ cell cancer, melanoma, adenoma, adrenal cancer, schwannoma, malignant, fibrous histiochytoma, or any combination thereof. The subject methods are applicable for treating squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma, neuroendocrine carcinoma of a GI tract, or any other cancer disclosed in “Glypican-3 expression in gastrointestinal and pancreatic epithelial neoplasms. (2013) 44, 542-550 Human Pathology.” Additionally immunoresponsive cells disclosed herein, such as an anti-GPC3-CAR-T disclosed herein, can be utilized to target ovarian carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, mesothelioma, breast cancer, squamous cell carcinoma of the lunch, cervical intraethithelial neoplasia, squamous cell carcinoma of the cervix, intrahepatic and extrahepatic cancer, gallbladder carcinoma, invasive ductal carcinoma, clear cell carcinoma, oncocytoma, papillary carcinoma, adenocarcinoma, papillary carcinoma, and lobular and medullary carcinoma of the breast. Additional targets for anti-GPC3 therapy can include those found in, “Glypican 3 expression in human nonneoplastic, preneoplastic, and neoplastic tissues. (2008) 129:899-906 Am J ClinPathol.” In some cases, a cancer or tumor cell can be evaluated for GPC3 expression by flow cytometry or immunohistochemistry. A level of GPC3 on a cancer or tumor cell can be classified as low, medium, or high. In some cases, a cancer or tumor cell can express GPC3 on the cell surface. Expression of GPC3 on a cell surface can be determined, for example, using antibodies to GPC3 in a method such as immunohistochemistry or flow cytometric analysis. Alternatively, GPC3 mRNA expression can be considered to correlate to GPC3 expression on a cell surface and can be determined by a method selected from in situ hybridization and RT-PCR. In some cases, GPC3 is encoded by a gene comprising the nucleic acid sequence exhibiting at least 50% sequence identity to the referenced gene in Table 2. GPC3 can be encoded by a gene comprising the nucleic acid sequence exhibiting at least about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% sequence identity to the referenced gene in Table 2. In some embodiments, anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor immunoresponsive cells are administered to a subject exhibiting a solid tumor expressing GPC3 after or concurrent with subjecting the subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment. A subject anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) typically comprises an extracellular antigen binding region, a transmembrane domain, and an intracellular signaling region that controls immunoresponsive cell activation. In some cases, the anti-GPC3 CAR further comprises a hinge or spacer. In some cases, the anti-GPC3 CAR further comprises one or more co-stimulatory domains. A chimeric antigen receptor typically comprises an extracellular antigen binding region. In one embodiment, the extracellular antigen binding region can be fully human. In other cases, the extracellular antigen binding region can be humanized. In other cases, the extracellular antigen binding region can be murine or a chimeric in the extracellular antigen binding region is composed of amino acid sequences derived from at least two different animal species. In some cases, the extracellular antigen binding region can be non-human. A variety of antigen binding regions can be designed to target GPC3. Non-limiting examples include single-chain variable fragments (scFv's) derived from antibodies, fragment antigen binding region (Fab) selected from libraries, single domain fragment, or nature ligands that engage their cognate receptor. An extracellular antigen binding region can encompass a scFv, a Fab, or a nature ligand, as well as any of their derivatives. An extracellular antigen binding region can refer to a molecule other than an intact antibody that can comprise a portion of an intact antibody and that can bind an antigen to which an intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments can include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab′, Fab′-SH, F (ab′) 2; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules (e.g. scFv); and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. An extracellular antigen binding region, for example the scFv, Fab, or natural ligand, can be a portion of a CAR that determines antigen specificity. An extracellular antigen binding region can bind to any complementary target. An extracellular antigen binding region can be derived from an antibody for which sequences of a variable region are known. An extracellular antigen binding region can be derived from an antibody sequence obtained from an available mouse hybridoma. Alternatively, an extracellular antigen binding region can be obtained from whole-exomic sequencing of a tumor cell or primary cell, such as a tumor infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL). In some cases, binding specificity of an extracellular antigen binding region can be determined by complementarity determining regions, or CDRs, such as light chain CDRs or heavy chain CDRs. In many cases, binding specificity can be determined by light chain CDRs and heavy chain CDRs. A given combination of heavy chain CDRs and light chain CDRs can provide a given binding pocket that can confer a greater affinity and/or specificity towards an antigen, such as GPC3, as compared to other reference antigens. For example, a CDR specific to glypican-3 can be expressed in an extracellular binding region of a CAR such that the CAR targeting the GPC3 can target the immunoresponsive cell to a tumor cell expressing GPC3. In some aspects of any of the embodiments disclosed herein, an extracellular antigen binding region, such as a scFv, can comprise a light chain CDR specific for GPC3. A light chain CDR can be a complementarity determining region of a light chain of an antigen binding unit, such as a scFv of a CAR. A light chain CDR can comprise a continuous sequence of amino acid residues, or two or more contiguous sequences of amino acid residues separated by, and optionally flanked by, non-complementarity determining regions, such as framework regions. In some cases, a light chain CDR can comprise two or more light chain CDRs, which can be referred to as light chain CDR-1, CDR-2, and so on. In some cases, a light chain CDR can comprise three light chain CDRs, which can be referred to as light chain CDR-1, light chain CDR-2, and light chain CDR-3 respectively. In some examples, a group of CDRs present on a common light chain can collectively be referred to as light chain CDRs. In some aspects of any of the embodiments disclosed herein, extracellular antigen binding region, such as a scFv, can comprise a heavy chain CDR specific for GPC3. A heavy chain CDR can be a complementarity determining region of a heavy chain of an antigen binding unit such as a scFv. A heavy chain CDR can comprise a continuous sequence of amino acid residues, or two or more contiguous sequences of amino acid residues separated by, and optionally flanked by, non-complementarity determining regions, such as framework regions. In some cases, a heavy chain CDR can comprise two or more heavy chain CDRs, which can be referred to as heavy chain CDR-1, CDR-2, and so on. In some cases, a heavy chain CDR can comprise three heavy chain CDRs, which can be referred to as heavy chain CDR-1, heavy chain CDR-2, and heavy chain CDR-3 respectively. In some cases, a group of CDRs present on a common heavy chain can collectively be referred to as heavy chain CDRs. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region targeting GPC3 can be expressed by an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell. In some cases, CDRs, light chain and/or heavy chain that bind a GPC3 antigen can be comprised within an extracellular antigen binding region of a CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as CAR T cells. In some cases, modified anti-GPC3 CDRs can be expressed on an extracellular antigen binding region of a CAR immunoresponsive cell and have from about 50% homology to about 100% homology to original anti-GPC3 CDRs. In some cases, a modified anti-GPC3 CDR can comprise from about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% homology to an unmodified anti-GPC3 CDR. In some cases, a scFv targeting GPC3 can be expressed by an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell. In some cases, CDRs, light chain and/or heavy chain that bind a GPC3 antigen can be expressed on a scFv of a CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as CAR T cells. In some cases, modified anti-GPC3 CDRs can be expressed on a scFv of a CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as CAR T cells, and have from about 50% homology to about 100% homology to original anti-GPC3 CDRs. In some cases, a modified anti-GPC3 CDR can comprise from about 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% homology to an unmodified anti-GPC3 CDR.

 In preferred cases, an extracellular antigen binding region specifically recognizes GPC3. GPC3 can comprise a sequence exhibition at least 80% identical to a referenced GPC3 gene in Table 2. In some cases, extracellular antigen binding region can target an N-terminus, a C-terminus, or any portion from an N-terminus to a C-terminus of GPC3. A C-terminus of a GPC3 can be attached to a cell membrane covalently via a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchor. A C-terminus can comprise from about 1 to about 800 bases in some cases. A C-terminus can comprise from about 1, 50, 100, 150, 300, 500, 600 up to about 800 bases from a C-terminal end. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region can target the GPI anchor of GPC3.

 By employing genetic engineering, an extracellular antigen binding region may be modified in a variety of ways. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region can be mutated, so that the extracellular antigen binding region may be selected for higher affinity to its target. In some cases, the affinity of the extracellular antigen binding region for its target can be optimized for targets that can be expressed at low levels on normal tissues. This optimization can be performed to minimize potential toxicities. In other cases, the cloning of an extracellular antigen binding region that has a higher affinity for the membrane bound form of a target can be preferable over its soluble form counterpart. This modification can be performed because some targets can also be detected in soluble form at different levels and their targeting can cause unintended toxicity. In some cases, a extracellular antigen binding region can be from about 50% to about 100% similar in homology to any one of SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, or SEQ ID NO: 8. In some cases, a extracellular antigen binding region can comprise about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or up to about 100% homology to SEQ ID NO: 1, SEQ ID NO: 2, SEQ ID NO: 3, SEQ ID NO: 4, SEQ ID NO: 5, SEQ ID NO: 6, SEQ ID NO: 7, or SEQ ID NO: 8. In some cases, extracellular antigen binding region can be murine, humanized, or fully human. An extracellular antigen binding region can be from about 1% to about 100% human. In some cases, a extracellular antigen binding region can be from about 10%, 20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or up to about 100% human. In some cases, an extracellular antigen binding region comprises a hinge or spacer. The terms hinge and spacer can be used interchangeably. A hinge can be considered a portion of a CAR used to provide flexibility to an extracellular antigen binding region. In some cases, a hinge can be used to detect a CAR on the cell surface of a cell, particularly when antibodies to detect the extracellular antigen binding region are not functional or available. For instance the length of the hinge derived from an immunoglobulin may require optimization depending on the location of the epitope on the target that the extracellular antigen binding region is targeting. In some cases, a hinge may not belong to an immunoglobulin but instead to another molecule such the native hinge of a CD8 alpha molecule. A CD8 alpha hinge can contain cysteine and proline residues known to play a role in the interaction of a CD8 co-receptor and MHC molecule. Said cysteine and proline residues can influence the performance of said CAR. A CAR hinge can be size tunable and can compensate to some extent in normalizing the orthogonal synapse distance between CAR immunoresponsive cell and a target cell. This topography of the immunological synapse between an immunoresponsive cell and a target cell also defines a distance that cannot be functionally bridged by a CAR due to a membrane-distal epitope on a cell-surface target molecule that, even with a short hinge CAR, cannot bring the synapse distance in to an approximation for signaling. Likewise, membrane-proximal CAR target antigen epitopes have been described for which signaling outputs are only observed in the context of a long hinge CAR. A hinge can be tuned according to the extracellular antigen binding region that is used. A hinge can be of any length. A transmembrane domain can anchor a CAR to the plasma membrane of a cell. A native transmembrane portion of CD28 can be used in a CAR. In other cases, a native transmembrane portion of CD8 alpha can also be used in the CAR. By “CD8” it can be meant a protein having at least 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identity to NCBI Reference No: NP_001759 or a fragment thereof that has stimulatory activity. By “CD8 nucleic acid molecule” it can be meant a polynucleotide encoding a CD8 polypeptide. In some cases, a transmembrane region can be a native transmembrane portion of CD28. By “CD28” it can be meant a protein having at least 85, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99 or 100% identity to NCBI Reference No: NP_006130 or a fragment thereof that has stimulatory activity. By “CD28 nucleic acid molecule” can be meant a polynucleotide encoding a CD28 polypeptide. In some cases, the transmembrane portion can comprise CD8a region. An intracellular signaling region of a CAR can be responsible for activation of at least one of an effector function of the immunoresponsive cell in which the CAR has been placed in. A CAR can induce the effector function of a T cell, for example, which may be cytolytic activity or helper activity including the secretion of cytokines. Thus the term intracellular signaling region refers to the portion of a protein which transduces the effector function signal and directs the cell to perform a specialized function. While usually the entire intracellular signaling region can be employed, in many cases it is not necessary to use the entire chain of a signaling domain. In some cases, a truncated portion of the intracellular signaling region is used. In some cases, the term intracellular signaling region is thus meant to include any truncated portion of the intracellular signaling region sufficient to transduce the effector function signal. Preferred examples of signaling domains for use in a CAR can include a cytoplasmic sequence of the T cell receptor (TCR) and co-receptors that act in concert to initiate signal transduction following target-receptor engagement, as well as any derivative or variant of these sequences and any synthetic sequence that has the same functional capability. In some cases, said intracellular signaling region may contain signaling motifs which are known as immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs). Examples of ITAM containing cytoplasmic signaling sequences include those derived from TCR zeta, FcR gamma, FcR beta, CD3 gamma, CD3 delta, CD3 epsilon, CD5, CD22, CD79a, CD79b, and CD66d. However, in preferred embodiments, the intracellular signaling domain is derived from CD3 zeta chain. An example of a T cell signaling domain containing one or more ITAM motifs is the CD3 zeta domain, also known as T-cell receptor T3 zeta chain or CD247. This domain is part of the T-cell receptor-CD3 complex and plays an important role in coupling antigen recognition to several intracellular signal-transduction pathways with primary effector activation of the T cell. As used herein, CD3 zeta is primarily directed to human CD3 zeta and its isoforms as known from Swissprot entry P20963, including proteins having a substantially identical sequence. As part of the chimeric antigen receptor, again the full T cell receptor T3 zeta chain is not required and any derivatives thereof comprising the signaling domain of T-cell receptor T3 zeta chain are suitable, including any functional equivalents thereof. An intracellular signaling domain can be selected from any one of the domains of Table 3. In some cases, a domain may be modified so that homology to any one of the refereneced domains may from about 50% to about 100%. Any one of the domains of Table 3 may be modified such that a modified version may comprise from about 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, or up to about 100% homology. An intracellular signaling region of a CAR can further comprise one or more costimulatory domains. An intracellular signaling region can comprise a single co-stimulatory domain, for example a zeta-chain (1st generation CAR), or CD28 or 4-1BB (2nd generation CAR). In other examples, an intracellular signaling region can comprise two co-stimulatory domains, such as CD28/OX40 or CD28/4-1BB (3rd generation). Together with intracellular signaling domains such as CD8, these co-stimulatory domains can produce downstream activation of kinase pathways, which support gene transcription and functional cellular responses. Co-stimulatory domains of CARs can activate proximal signaling proteins related to either CD28 (Phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase) or 4-1BB/OX40 (TNF-receptor-associated-factor adapter proteins) pathways, and MAPK and Akt activation. In some cases, signals generated through the CAR can be complexed with secondary or co-stimulatory signals. With respect to the co-stimulatory signaling domain, the chimeric antigen receptor like complex can be designed to comprise several possible co-stimulatory signaling domains. As is well known in the art, in naïve T-cells the mere engagement of the T-cell receptor is not sufficient to induce full activation of T-cells into cytotoxic T-cells. Full, productive T cell activation requires a second co-stimulatory signal. Several receptors that have been reported to provide co-stimulation for T-cell activation, include, but are not limited to CD28, OX40, CD27, CD2, CD5, ICAM-1, LFA-1 (CD11a/CD18), 4-1BBL, MyD88 and 4-1BB. The signaling pathways utilized by these co-stimulatory molecules share the common property of acting in synergy with the primary T cell receptor activation signal. These co-stimulatory signaling regions provide a signal that can be synergistic with the primary effector activation signal originating from one or more ITAM motifs, for example a CD3 zeta signaling domain, and can complete the requirements for activation of the T cell. In some cases, addition of co-stimulatory domains to a chimeric antigen receptor-like complex can enhance efficacy and durability of engineered cells. In another embodiment the T cell signaling domain and the co-stimulatory domain are fused to one another thereby composing the signaling region.

 In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR can have at least one or more of the following characteristics, in any combination: a) binds to recombinant human GPC3; b) binds to recombinant cynomolgus monkey GPC3; c) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of HepG2 cells; d) binds to cynomolgus monkey GPC3 expressed on the surface of 293 cells; e) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of a cancer cell; f) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of hepatocellular carcinoma cell; g) binds to endogenous GPC3 on the surface of cells of a cell line selected from HepG2, Hep3B, Huh7, and JHH-7; h) binds to an epitope within amino acids 25 to 137 of human GPC3; i) binds to an epitope spanning the furin cleavage site at amino acids R358/S359 of human GPC3; j) binds to full-length mature human GPC3, but does not bind to an N-terminal fragment of human GPC3 or to a C-terminal fragment of human GPC3 k) binds to an epitope within amino acids 420 to 470 of human GPC3; 1) binds to an epitope within amino acids 470 to 509 of human GPC3; m) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 7H1; n) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 4G7; o) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 15G1; binds a C-terminal fragment of human GPC3; and/or p) competes for binding to human GPC3 with antibody 4A11. A transgene encoding a subject anti-GPC3 CAR can be incorporated into a cell. For example, a transgene can be incorporated into an immunoresponsive cell, such as a T cell. When inserted into a cell, a transgene can be either a complementary DNA (cDNA) segment, which is a copy of messenger RNA (mRNA), or a gene itself residing in its original region of genomic DNA (with or without introns). A nucleic acid, e.g., DNA, encoding a transgene sequence can be randomly inserted into a chromosome of a cell. A random integration can result from any method of introducing a nucleic acid, e.g., DNA, into a cell. For example, the method can be, but is not limited to, electroporation, sonoporation, use of a gene gun, lipotransfection, calcium phosphate transfection, use of dendrimers, microinjection, and use of viral vectors including adenoviral, AAV, and retroviral vectors, and/or group II ribozymes. A DNA encoding a transgene can be introduced into a cell via electroporation. A DNA can also be introduced into a cell via lipofection, infection, or transformation. Electroporation and/or lipofection can be used to transfect primary cells. Electroporation and/or lipofection can be used to transfect primary hematopoietic cells. A DNA can also be introduced into a cell genome without the use of homologous recombination. In some cases, a DNA can be flanked by engineered sites that are complementary to the targeted double strand break region in a genome. In some cases, a DNA can be excised from a polynucleic acid so it can be inserted at a double strand break region without homologous recombination. A transgene to be inserted can be flanked by engineered sites analogous to a targeted double strand break site in the genome to excise the transgene from a polynucleic acid so it can be inserted at the double strand break region. A DNA encoding a transgene can also be designed to include a reporter gene so that the presence of a transgene or its expression product can be detected via activation of the reporter gene. Any reporter gene can be used, such as those disclosed above. By selecting in cell culture those cells in which a reporter gene has been activated, cells can be selected that contain a transgene. Expression of a CAR can be verified by an expression assay, for example, qPCR or by measuring levels of RNA. Expression level can be indicative also of copy number. For example, if expression levels are extremely high, this can indicate that more than one copy of a CAR was integrated in a genome. Alternatively, high expression can indicate that a transgene was integrated in a highly transcribed area, for example, near a highly expressed promoter. Expression can also be verified by measuring protein levels, such as through Western blotting. A subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can comprise one or more transgenes. One or more transgenes can express a CAR protein recognizing and binding to at least one epitope (e.g., GPC3) on an antigen or bind to a mutated epitope on an antigen. A CAR can be a functional CAR. A subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can also comprise one or more CARs, or it can comprise a single CAR and a secondary engineered receptor. A transgene can encode for a suicide gene. As evidenced in many effective treatments in cancer patients, objective tumor regressions in response to CAR immunoresponsive cells can be accompanied by toxicities. In some cases, a CAR immunoresponsive cell may be unable to distinguish between tumor and normal tissues when the targeted antigen is shared between them (“on-target/off-tumor” toxicity). In other cases, systemic perturbation of the immune system, known as cytokine release syndrome (CRS), can occur. Said CRS can comprise systemic inflammatory response syndrome or cytokine storm, which can be consequences of the rapid in vivo expansion of CAR immunoresponsive cells. CRS is a condition characterized by fever and hypotension that, in severe cases, can lead to multiple organ failure. In most cases, said toxicity correlates with the in vivo expansion of infused CAR immunoresponsive cells, which can cause a general perturbation of the immune system, and release of high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF alpha and IL-6. In some cases, CAR immunoresponsive cells targeting antigens shared with normal tissues can be generated such that they transiently express the CAR, for example after electroporation of mRNA encoding the receptor. In addition, there are significant efforts to further engineer CAR immunoresponsive cells by including safety switches that can allow the drastic elimination of CAR immunoresponsive cells in case of severe on-target toxicity. Vectors encoding a CAR can be combined with safety switches, such as the inducible caspase-9 gene (activated by a chemical inducer of dimerization) or a truncated form of the EGF receptor R (activated by the monoclonal antibody cetuximab) or RQR8. A subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can encode a suicide gene transgene. Said transgene can also comprise a CAR receptor or another similar receptor. A suicide gene can induce elimination of CAR immunoresponsive cells. A suicide gene can be any gene that induces apoptosis in said CAR immunoresponsive cell. A suicide gene can be encoded within a viral vector along with an anti-GPC3 CAR. One or more transgenes can be from different species. For example, one or more transgenes can comprise a human gene, a mouse gene, a rat gene, a pig gene, a bovine gene, a dog gene, a cat gene, a monkey gene, a chimpanzee gene, or any combination thereof. For example, a transgene can be from a human, having a human genetic sequence. One or more transgenes can comprise human genes. In some cases, one or more transgenes are not adenoviral genes. A transgene can be inserted into a genome of an immunoresponsive cell in a random or site-specific manner, as described above. For example, a transgene can be inserted to a random locus in a genome of an immunoresponsive cell. These transgenes can be functional, e.g., fully functional if inserted anywhere in a genome. For instance, a transgene can encode its own promoter or can be inserted into a position where it is under the control of an endogenous promoter. Alternatively, a transgene can be inserted into a gene, such as an intron of a gene or an exon of a gene, a promoter, or a non-coding region. A transgene can be inserted such that the insertion disrupts a gene, e.g., an endogenous immune checkpoint. Sometimes, more than one copy of a transgene can be inserted into more than a random locus in a genome. For example, multiple copies can be inserted into a random locus in a genome. This can lead to increased overall expression than if a transgene was randomly inserted once. Alternatively, a copy of a transgene can be inserted into a gene, and another copy of a transgene can be inserted into a different gene. A transgene can be targeted so that it could be inserted to a specific locus in a genome of a immunoresponsive cell. In some cases, a polynucleic acid comprising a sequence encoding a subject anti-GPC3 CAR, can take the form of a plasmid vector. A plasmid vector can comprise a promoter. In some cases, a promotor can be constitutive. In some cases, a promoter can be inducible. A promoter can be or can be derived from CMV, U6, MND, or EF1a. In some cases, a promoter can be adjacent to a CAR sequence. In some cases, a plasmid vector further comprises a splicing acceptor. In some cases, a splicing acceptor can be adjacent to a CAR sequence. A promoter sequence can be a PKG or an MND promoter. An MND promoter can be a synthetic promoter that contains a U3 region of a modified MoMuLV LTR with a myeloproliferative sarcoma virus enhancer. In some cases, a polynucleic acid, encoding a subject anti-GPC3 CAR, can be designed to be delivered to a cell by non-viral techniques. In some cases, a polynucleic acid can be a good manufacturing practices (GMP) compatible reagent. Expression of a polynucleic acid encoding for a subject anti-GPC3 CAR can be controlled by one or more promoters. A promoter can be a ubiquitous, constitutive (unregulated promoter that allows for continual transcription of an associated gene), tissue-specific promoter or an inducible promoter. Expression of a transgene that is inserted adjacent to or near a promoter can be regulated. For example, a transgene can be inserted near or next to a ubiquitous promoter. Some ubiquitous promoters can be a CAGGS promoter, an hCMV promoter, a PGK promoter, an SV40 promoter, or a ROSA26 promoter. A promoter can be endogenous or exogenous. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to an endogenous or exogenous ROSA26 promoter. Further, a promoter can be specific to an immunoresponsive cell. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to a porcine ROSA26 promoter. Tissue specific promoter or cell-specific promoters can be used to control the location of expression. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to a tissue-specific promoter. Tissue-specific promoters can be a FABP promoter, an Lck promoter, a CamKII promoter, a CD19 promoter, a Keratin promoter, an Albumin promoter, an aP2 promoter, an insulin promoter, an MCK promoter, a MyHC promoter, a WAP promoter, or a Col2A promoter. Tissue specific promoter or cell-specific promoters can be used to control the location of expression. For example, one or more transgenes can be inserted adjacent or near to a tissue-specific promoter. Tissue-specific promoters can be a FABP promoter, an Lck promoter, a CamKII promoter, a CD19 promoter, a Keratin promoter, an Albumin promoter, an aP2 promoter, an insulin promoter, an MCK promoter, a MyHC promoter, a WAP promoter, or a Col2A promoter. Inducible promoters can be used as well. These inducible promoters can be turned on and off when desired, by adding or removing an inducing agent. It is contemplated that an inducible promoter can be, but is not limited to, a Lac, tac, trc, trp, araBAD, phoA, recA, proU, cst-1, tetA, cadA, nar, PL, cspA, T7, VHB, Mx, and/or Trex. Furthermore, although not required for expression, transgene sequence may also include transcriptional or translational regulatory sequences, for example, promoters, enhancers, insulators, internal ribosome entry sites, sequences encoding 2A peptides and/or polyadenylation signals. In some instances, a transgene encodes a subject anti-GPC3 CAR wherein the transgene is inserted into a safe harbor such that an anti-GPC3 CAR is expressed. In some instances, the transgene is inserted into a PD1 and/or a CTLA-4 locus. In other cases, a transgene is delivered to the cell in a lentivirus for random insertion while the PD1- or CTLA-4 specific nucleases can be supplied as mRNAs. In some instances, the transgene is delivered via a viral vector system such as a retrovirus, AAV or adenovirus along with mRNA encoding nucleases specific for a safe harbor (e.g. AAVS1, CCR5, albumin or HPRT). The cells can also be treated with mRNAs encoding PD1 and/or CTLA-4 specific nucleases. In some cases, the polynucleotide encoding a CAR is supplied via a viral delivery system together with mRNA encoding HPRT specific nucleases and PD 1- or CTLA-4 specific nucleases. CARs that can be used with the methods and compositions disclosed herein can include all types of these chimeric proteins, including first, second and third generation designs. Other agents such as CCR2 or siRNA can be applied to reduce PD-1 expression. In some cases, a retroviral vector (either gamma-retroviral or lentiviral) can be employed for the introduction of the transgene into an immunoresponsive cell. For example, a transgene encoding a CAR (e.g., anti-GPC3 CAR), or any receptor that binds a GPC3 antigen, or a variant, or a fragment thereof, can be cloned into a retroviral vector and expression can be driven from its endogenous promoter, from the retroviral long terminal repeat, or from a promoter specific for a target cell type of interest. Non-viral vectors may be used as well. Non-viral vector delivery systems can include DNA plasmids, naked nucleic acid, and nucleic acid complexed with a delivery vehicle such as a liposome or poloxamer. A number of viral based systems have been developed for gene transfer into mammalian cells. For example, retroviruses provide a convenient platform for gene delivery systems. A selected gene can be inserted into a vector and packaged in retroviral particles using techniques known in the art. Vectors derived from retroviruses such as the lentivirus are suitable tools to achieve long-term gene transfer since they allow long-term, stable integration of a transgene and its propagation in daughter cells. Lentiviral vectors have the added advantage over vectors derived from onco-retroviruses such as murine leukemia viruses in that they can transduce non-proliferating cells. They also have the added advantage of low immunogenicity. Adenoviral vectors have the advantage that they do not integrate into the genome of the target cell thereby bypassing negative integration-related events. A cell can be transfected with a transgene encoding a CAR. A transgene concentration can be from about 100 picograms to about 50 micrograms. In some cases, the amount of nucleic acid (e.g., ssDNA, dsDNA, RNA) that may be introduced into a cell may be varied to optimize transfection efficiency and/or cell viability. For example, 1 microgram of dsDNA may be added to each cell sample for electroporation. In some cases, the amount of nucleic acid (e.g., dsDNA) required for optimal transfection efficiency and/or cell viability may be specific to the cell type. In some cases, the amount of nucleic acid (e.g., dsDNA) used for each sample may directly correspond to the transfection efficiency and/or cell viability. For example, a range of concentrations of transfections. A transgene encoded by a vector can integrate into a cellular genome. In some cases, integration of a transgene encoded by a vector is in the forward direction. In other cases, integration of a transgene encoded by a vector is in the reverse direction. In some cases, the starting cell density for cellular modification, such as viral delivery of a CAR, may be varied to optimize transfection efficiency and/or cell viability. In some cases, the starting cell density for transfection or transduction of cells with a viral vector may be less than about 1×105 cells. In some cases, the starting cell density for cellular modification with a viral vector may be at least about 1×105 cells to at least about 5×107 cells. In some cases, the starting cell density for optimal transfection efficiency and/or cell viability may be specific to the cell type. For example, a starting cell density of 1.5×106 cells may optimal (e.g., provide the highest viability and/or transfection efficiency) for macrophage cells. In another example, a starting cell density of 5×106 cells may optimal (e.g., provide the highest viability and/or transfection efficiency) for human cells. In some cases, a range of starting cell densities may be optimal for a given cell type. For example, a starting cell density between of 5.6×106 and 5×107 cells may optimal (e.g., provide the highest viability and/or transfection efficiency) for human cells such as T cells. The efficiency of integration of a nucleic acid sequence encoding CAR into a genome of a cell with, for example, a viral system, can be or can be about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, or more than 99.9%. In some cases, detection of a CAR on a cellular membrane of an engineered cell can be or can be about 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, or more than 99.9% as measured by flow cytometry. In some cases, the immunoresponsive cell can be a stem memory TSCM cell comprised of CD45RO (−), CCR7(+), CD45RA (+), CD62L+(L-selectin), CD27+, CD28+ and/or IL-7Rα+, said stem memory cells can also express CD95, IL-2Rβ, CXCR3, and/or LFA-1, and show numerous functional attributes distinctive of said stem memory cells. Alternatively, the immunoresponsive cell can also be central memory TCM cells comprising L-selectin and CCR7, where the central memory cells can secrete, for example, IL-2, but not IFNγ or IL-4. The immunoresponsive cells can also be effector memory TEM cells comprising L-selectin or CCR7 and produce, for example, effector cytokines such as IFNγ and IL-4. Vectors can be delivered in vivo by administration to an individual patient, typically by systemic administration (e.g., intravenous, intraperitoneal, intramuscular, subdermal, or intracranial infusion) or topical application, as described below. Alternatively, vectors can be delivered to cells ex vivo, such as cells explanted from an individual patient (e.g., lymphocytes, T cells, bone marrow aspirates, tissue biopsy), followed by reimplantation of the cells into a patient, usually after selection for cells which have incorporated the vector. Prior to or after selection, the cells can be expanded. A suitable immunoresponsive cell for expressing anti-GPC3-CAR can be a cell that may be autologous or non-autologous to a subject in need thereof. A source of suitable immunoresponsive cells can be obtained from a subject. In some cases T cells can be obtained. Said T cells can be obtained from a number of sources, including PBMCs, bone marrow, lymph node tissue, cord blood, thymus tissue, and tissue from a site of infection, ascites, pleural effusion, spleen tissue, and tumors. In certain cases, T cells can be obtained from a unit of blood collected from a subject using any number of techniques known to the skilled artisan, such as Ficoll™ separation. In one embodiment, cells from the circulating blood of an individual are obtained by apheresis. The apheresis product typically contains lymphocytes, including T cells, monocytes, granulocytes, B cells, other nucleated white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. In one embodiment, the cells collected by apheresis may be washed to remove the plasma fraction and to place the cells in an appropriate buffer or media for subsequent processing steps. Alternatively, a cell can be derived from a healthy donor, from a patient diagnosed with cancer, or from a patient diagnosed with an infection. In another embodiment, a cell can be part of a mixed population of cells which present different phenotypic characteristics. A cell line can also be obtained from a transformed T cell according to the method previously described. A cell can also be obtained from a cell therapy bank. Modified cells resistant to an immunosuppressive treatment can be obtained by any of the method described herein. A desirable cell population can also be selected prior to modification. An engineered cell population can also be selected after modification. An engineered cell can be used in autologous transplantation. Alternatively, a cell can be used in allogeneic transplantation. In some instances, a cell is administered to the same patient whose sample was used to identify the cancer-related target sequence. In other instances, a cell is administered to a patient different from the patient whose sample was used to identify the cancer-related target sequence. In some cases, an immune responsive cell can be a primary cell including primary T cell, a stem cell, or a progenitor cell. A progenitor cell can be a hematopoietic progenitor cell. A cell of the present invention can be a human cell. Suitable cells can be expanded ex vivo. A suitable cell can also be CD45RO(−), CCR7(+), CD45RA(+), CD62L(+), CD27(+), CD28(+), IL-7Ra(+), or combinations thereof. In some cases, suitable primary cells include peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), and other blood cell subsets such as, but not limited to, T cell, a natural killer cell, a monocyte, a natural killer T cell, a monocyte-precursor cell, a hematopoietic stem cell or a non-pluripotent stem cell. In some cases, the cell can be any immune cells including any T-cell such as tumor infiltrating cells (TILs), such as CD3+ T-cells, CD4+ T-cells, CD8+ T-cells, or any other type of T-cell. The T cell can also include memory T cells, memory stem T cells, or effector T cells. The T cells can also be selected from a bulk population, for example, selecting T cells from whole blood. The T cells can also be expanded from a bulk population. The T cells can also be skewed towards particular populations and phenotypes. For example, the T cells can be skewed to phenotypically comprise, CD45RO (−), CCR7 (+), CD45RA (+), CD62L (+), CD27 (+), CD28 (+) and/or IL-7Ra (+). Suitable cells can be selected that comprise one of more markers selected from a list comprising: CD45RO (−), CCR7 (+), CD45RA (+), CD62L (+), CD27 (+), CD28 (+) and/or IL-7Rα (+). Suitable cells also include stem cells such as, by way of example, embryonic stem cells, induced pluripotent stem cells, hematopoietic stem cells, neuronal stem cells and mesenchymal stem cells. Suitable cells can comprise any number of primary cells, such as human cells, non-human cells, and/or mouse cells. Suitable cells can be progenitor cells. Suitable cells can be derived from the subject to be treated (e.g., patient). Suitable cells can be derived from a human donor. Suitable cells can be stem memory TSCM cells comprised of CD45RO (−), CCR7(+), CD45RA (+), CD62L+(L-selectin), CD27+, CD28+ and IL-7Rα+, said stem memory cells can also express CD95, IL-2Rβ, CXCR3, and LFA-1, and show numerous functional attributes distinctive of said stem memory cells. Suitable cells can be central memory TCM cells comprising L-selectin and CCR7, said central memory cells can secrete, for example, IL-2, but not IFNγ or IL-4. Suitable cells can also be effector memory TEM cells comprising L-selectin or CCR7 and produce, for example, effector cytokines such as IFNγ and IL-4. In some cases, a method can include enriching cultured T cells for CD8+ T cells prior to rapid expansion of cells. Following culture of T cells in IL-2, the T cells can be depleted of CD4+ cells and enriched for CD8+ cells using, for example, a CD8 microbead separation (e.g., using a CliniMACSplus CD8 microbead system (Miltenyi Biotec)). Without being bound to a particular theory, it can be believed that CD4+, CD25+ regulatory T-cells can impede anti-tumor responses. Accordingly, it can be believed that enriching cultured T cells for CD8+ T cells and reducing or eliminating CD4+ cells may improve the impact of adoptively transferred anti-tumor CD8+ cells, improve the response rates in patients, and/or reduce the toxicities seen by production of cytokines by CD4+ cells. Additionally, enriched CD8+ “young” T cells can be believed to behave more reliably and predictably in clinical scale rapid expansions than the bulk T cells. A cell can be a good manufacturing practices (GMP) compatible reagent. A cell can be part of a combination therapy to treat cancer, infections, autoimmune disorders, or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) in a subject in need thereof. In some cases, a cell of the present invention can be administered of a subject in need thereof as a monotherapy. In some cases, cells expressing a subject CAR include heterogeneous T cell populations. In some cases, cells used can be largely composed of a heterogeneous proportion of CD4 and CD8 T cells. Said CD4 and CD8 cells can have phenotypic characteristics of circulating effector T cells. Said CD4 and CD8 cells can also have a phenotypic characteristic of effector-memory cells. In another embodiment, cells can be central-memory cells. Suitable cells that can be isolated from a donor can be at any stage of development including, but not limited to, fetal, neonatal, young and adult. For example, donor immunoresponsive cells can be isolated from adult human Donor human immunoresponsive cells can be under the age of 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1 year(s). For example, immunoresponsive cells can be isolated from a human under the age of 6 years Immunoresponsive cells can also be isolated from a human under the age of 3 years. A donor can be older than 10 years. A method of attaining suitable cells can comprise selecting based on a given marker. For example, such marker can comprise GFP, a resistance gene, a cell surface marker, or an endogenous tag. Cells can be selected using any endogenous marker. Applicable cell selection techniques include flow cytometry and/or magnetic columns. Selected cells can subsequently be infused into a subject. Selected cells can also be expanded to large numbers. Selected cells can be expanded prior to infusion. The amount of cells that are necessary to be therapeutically effective in a patient may vary depending on the viability of the cells, and the efficiency with which the cells have been genetically modified (e.g., the efficiency with which a transgene has been integrated into one or more cells, or a level of expression of a protein encoded by the transgene). In some cases, the product (e.g., multiplication) of the viability of cells post genetic modification and the efficiency of integration of a transgene may correspond to the therapeutic aliquot of cells available for administration to a subject. In some cases, an increase in the viability of cells post genetic modification may correspond to a decrease in the amount of cells that are necessary for administration to be therapeutically effective in a patient. In some cases, an increase in the efficiency with which a transgene has been integrated into one or more cells may correspond to a decrease in the amount of cells that are necessary for administration to be therapeutically effective in a patient. In some cases, determining an amount of cells that are necessary to be therapeutically effective may comprise determining a function corresponding to a change in the viability of cells over time. In some cases, determining an amount of cells that are necessary to be therapeutically effective may comprise determining a function corresponding to a change in the efficiency with which a transgene may be integrated into one or more cells with respect to time dependent variables (e.g., cell culture time, electroporation time, cell stimulation time). In some cases, therapeutically effective cells can be a population of cells that comprise from about 30% to about 100% expression of an anti-GPC3 CAR on a cellular surface. In some cases, therapeutically effective cells can express an anti-GPC3 CAR on a cellular surface from about 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, 99.5%, 99.9%, to more than about 99.9% as measured by flow cytometry. A variety of cells can be used to express the subject CAR, as described above. Anti-GPC3 CAR can be present in the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell, e.g., a mammalian cell, where suitable mammalian cells include, but are not limited to, a cytotoxic cell, a T lymphocyte, a stem cell, a progeny of a stem cell, a progenitor cell, a progeny of a progenitor cell, and an NK cell. When present in the plasma membrane of a eukaryotic cell, a CAR can be active in the presence of its binding target. For example, an anti-GPC3 CAR can be active in the presence of GPC3. A target, such as GPC3, can be expressed on a membrane. A target can also be soluble (e.g., not bound to a cell). A target can be present on the surface of a cell such as a target cell. A target can be presented on a solid surface such as a lipid bilayer; and the like. A target can be soluble, such as a soluble antigen. A target can be an antigen. An antigen can be present on the surface of a cell such as a target cell. An antigen can be presented on a solid surface such as a lipid bilayer; and the like. In some cases, a target can be an epitope of an antigen. In methods disclosed herein, the antigen is typically GPC3 and the GPC3 expressing target cell is a cancer or tumor cell. In some instances, a CAR, when present on the plasma membrane of a cell, and when activated by binding its target, can result in cytotoxic activity by the cell toward a target that expresses on its cell surface an antigen to which the binding domain of the CAR binds. For example, in some cases a cell can be a cytotoxic cell (e.g., an NK cell or a cytotoxic T lymphocyte), a CAR of the present disclosure, when present in the plasma membrane of a cell, and when activated by binding its target, can increase cytotoxic activity of a cytotoxic cell toward a target cell that expresses on its cell surface an antigen to which the binding domain of a CAR binds. For example, in some cases a cell can be an NK cell or a T lymphocyte, a CAR of the present disclosure, when present in the plasma membrane of a cell, and when activated by binding of its target, can increase cytotoxic activity of a cell by at least 10%, at least 15%, at least 20%, at least 25%, at least 30%, at least 40%, at least 50%, at least 75%, at least 2-fold, at least 2.5-fold, at least 5-fold, at least 10-fold, or more 10-fold, compared to the cytotoxic activity of the cell in the absence of the binding target. In some cases, a CAR, when activated by binding its target, can result in other CAR activation related events such as proliferation and expansion (either due to increased cellular division or anti-apoptotic responses). Cellular proliferation can be visually measured by the observance of cellular clumping as seen under a microscope. Cellular expansion can be measured by a hemocytometer measurement. In some cases, a CAR-T cell can have increased cellular proliferation and expansion when compared to a comparable T cell, a non-CAR T cell. Increased cellular expansion can be from about 1 fold to about 20 hold over that of a comparable cell. Increased cellular expansion can be from about 1 fold, 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 5 fold, 6 fold, 7 fold, 8 fold, 9 fold, 10 fold, 11 fold, 12 fold, 13 fold, 14 fold, 15 fold, 16 fold, 17 fold, 18 fold, 19 fold, or up to 20 fold over that of a comparable cell. Cellular expansion can be measured over a period of time. For example, cellular expansion can take place from cellular acquision to the time of infusion into a subject. In other cases, cellular expansion can take place from about 1 day to up to about 30 days after acquisition. Cellular expansion can take place from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, or up to 30 days after acquisition. In some cases, a rapid expansion protocol (REP) can be utilized to expand cells prior to infusion into a subject. A REP can occur over a period of about 14 days in some cases. In some cases, a CAR, when activated by binding its target, can result in other CAR activation related events such as intracellular signaling modulation, cellular differentiation, or cell death. In some cases, expression of a CAR on a cell may alter intracellular signaling of a cell. In other cases, expression of a CAR may alter cellular differentiation. Subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered to a subject exhibiting a GPC3 expressing cancer or tumor either concurrently or after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some aspects, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells are administered after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. The treatment can reduce the circulating lymphocytes in a treated subject, or substantially deplete the circulating lymphocytes the lymphocyte (i.e., lymphocyte reduction). For example, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered at least 1 hour to at least 1 week after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. For example, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered at least 1 hour, 2 hours, 4, hours, 6, hours, 8 hours, 10 hours, 12, hours, 14 hours, 16 hours, 18 hours, 20 hours, 24 hours, 36 hours, 48 hours, 3 days, 4 days, 5 days, 6 days, or 7 days or longer after lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, CAR-T can be administered about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 weeks, or longer after a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, host lymphopenia can facilitate expansion of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as CAR T cells. On the one hand, lymphopenia can create “space” for oncoming adoptively transferred cells and, on the other, it can induce their homeostatic expansion. The latter effect can be likely mediated through chemotherapeutic ablation of endogenous regulatory T cells, which can normally secrete inhibitory cytokines (e.g. TGF-β and IL-10) that can limit effector cell expansion, such as CAR T cells. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can improve expansion of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in vivo by about 1 fold, 2 fold, 3 fold, 4 fold, 5 fold, 6 fold, 7 fold, 8 fold, 9 fold, 10 fold, 11 fold, 12 fold, 13 fold, 14 fold, 15 fold, 16 fold, 17 fold, 18 fold, 19 fold, or up to 20 fold over treatment with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells without a lymphocyte reduction treatment. Additionally, T-cell growth homeostatic cytokines, such as IL-7 and IL-15, which may ordinarily exist in limiting amounts, may become readily available due to less competition and increased production by lymphopoietic stromal cells. Thus, induction of lymphocyte reduction prior to infusion of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells may be performed to increase efficacy of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in treating a subject. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-tumor efficacy as measured by tumor reduction or control by about 10% to about 100% over treatment without a lymphocyte reduction treatment. For example a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-tumor efficacy from about 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or up to 100% over treatment without a lymphocyte reduction treatment. A lymphocyte reduction can be performed using various means. Lymphocyte reduction before anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells administration can be performed using total body irradiation (TBI) or cytotoxic drugs. Although these modalities may intended to deplete the lymphoid compartment of a recipient, they can also facilitate the presentation of tumor antigens by triggering tumor cell death and antigen release. Subsequently, these antigens can be taken up and presented by antigen presenting cells (APCs) to enhance the activation of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. Irradiation and/or chemotherapy can lead to activation of host cells, resulting in the release of proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-α, IL-1 and IL-4, and upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules, such as CD80. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy by activation of host cells. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy by upregulation of co-stimulatory molecules. In addition to enhanced APC function and availability, a preconditioning regimen can damage the integrity of mucosal barriers through radiation-induced apoptosis of cells lining these organs. Damage inflicted on the intestinal tract might permit the translocation of bacterial products, such as LPS, into the systemic circulation. LPS can in turn activate anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in vivo and might enhance the antitumor response. Thus, proinflammatory cytokines and microbial products provide crucial ‘danger signals’ for the activation and maturation of DCs, thus enhancing anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell-mediated tumor treatment. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can selectively deplete CD25-expressing cells in humans, including humanized anti-Tac (anti-CD25) and ONTAK™ (IL-2 conjugated to diphtheria toxin). In some cases, a chemotherapeutic can be administered to effect lymphocyte reduction in a subject. In some cases, a subject may receive nonmyeloablative lympho-reduction chemotherapy. A nonmyeloablative lympho-reduction chemotherapy can be any suitable such therapy, which can be administered by any suitable route. Chemotherapeutic regimens may include use of single alkylating agents such as cyclophosphamide or chlorambucil, or combinations such as CVP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine and prednisone), CHOP (CVP and doxorubicin), C-MOPP (cyclophosphamide, vincristine, prednisone and procarbazine), CAP-BOP (CHOP plus procarbazine and bleomycin), m-BACOD (CHOP plus methotrexate, bleomycin and leucovorin), ProMACE-MOPP (prednisone, methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide and leucovorin plus standard MOPP), ProMACE-CytaBOM (prednisone, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, cytarabine, bleomycin, vincristine, methotrexate and leucovorin) and MACOP-B (methotrexate, doxorubicin, cyclophosphamide, vincristine, fixed dose prednisone, bleomycin and leucovorin). A nonmyeloablative lympho-reduction chemotherapy can comprise, for example, administration of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine, particularly if a cancer is GPC3 positive, which can be metastatic. A preferred route of administering cyclophosphamide and fludarabine can be intravenously. Likewise, any suitable dose of cyclophosphamide and fludarabine can be administered. Preferably, around 60 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide can be administered for two days after which around 25 mg/m2 fludarabine can be administered for about five days. In some cases, lymphocyte reduction can be performed to minimize immune-mediated anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell rejection. For example, a subject can be treated with cyclophosphamide (Cy) followed by fludarabine (Flu) lymphocyte reduction treatment. A dose of a chemotherapeutic such as Cy can be from about 1 mg/kg to about 200 mg/kg. A dose of Cy can be from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 79 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or up to about 200 mg/kg of a subject. Alternatively, an exemplary dose and regimen for Cy treatment can be from about 0.5˜5 g/m2/day, preferably 0.6˜3 g/m2/d, more preferably 1˜2 g/m2/day, for 1-3 days, preferably 1-2 days; A dose of Flu can be from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 79 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, or up to about 200 mg/m2 of a subject. Alternatively, an exemplary dose and regimen for fludarabine treatment can be from about 20˜80 mg/m2/day, preferably 25˜70 mg/m2/day or 25˜30 mg/m2/day, for 2˜10, 3˜8 or 4, 5, 6 or 7 days; In some cases, combined use of Cy and Flu can be applied. For example, initial dose of Flu in the range of about 10˜60 mg/m2/day or 15˜50 mg/m2/day or 20˜30 mg/m2/day for 2˜8 days or 3˜6 days, is followed by Cy in the amount of about 0.2˜1 mg/m2/day or 0.3˜0.8 mg/m2/day or 0.4˜0.6 g/m2/day for 1-5 or 2-3 days. In some cases, a subject can be treated with Cy and Flu at Cy 60 mg/kg×1 administration and Flu 25 mg/m2×3 to 5 administrations before anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. A subject can receive from about 0 to about 20 administrations of a lymphodepletant before an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. A subject can receive from about 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, up to about 20 administrations of a lymphodepletant, such as Cy or Flu, prior to anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. In other cases, a subject may be co-administered a lymphodepletant, such as Cy and/or Flu, concurrent with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. In other cases, a subject may be administered a lymphodepletant, such as Cy and/or Flu, after an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell administration. In other cases, a subject may be administered a lymphodepletant prior, concurrent, and/or after an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell administration. A subject may not receive a lymphocyte reduction treatment is some cases. In some cases, different doses of lymphodepletants may be used during the course of a regime. For example, a subject may receive 60 mg/kg of Cy prior to anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, followed by a dose of 40 mg/kg of Cy concurrent with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. A complete blood count (CBC) may be performed to determine the extent of lymphocyte reduction and if additional administrations may be required. In some cases, Cy may be administered alone. In other cases, Flu may be administered alone. In some cases, Cy and Flu may be alternated during a regime. Lymphocyte reduction may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell expansion. Lymphocyte reduction may improve anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell persistence in blood. Anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell expansion and persistence may be detected by flow cytometric analysis utilizing an anti-CAR antibody. Anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell persistence may also be measured by evaluating copy number of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell by qPCR. In some cases, a subject may receive a reduction in anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell dose if subject to a lymphocyte reduction treatment compared to a subject that may not receive a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can be administered over a period of time. For example a lymphocyte reduction treatment may be administered over the course of 1 min up to about 24 hours. A lymphocyte reduction treatment may be performed from 1 min, 15 min, 45 min, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, 6 hours, 7 hours, 8 hours, 9 hours, 10 hours, 11 hours, 12 hours, 13 hours, 14 hours, 15 hours, 16 hours, 17 hours, 18 hours, 19 hours, 20 hours, 21 hours, 22 hours, 23 hours, or up to about 24 hours. Lympho-reduction agents may be coadministered with additional agents such as diluents, uroprotectants, excipients, or a combination thereof. For example, sodium 2-mercaptoethanesulfonate (Mesna) may be included in a lymphocyte reduction treatment. In some cases, a subject may be administered cyclophosphamide 60 mg/kg/day for about 2 days IV in 250 ml D5W with Mesna 15 mg/kg/day for 2 days over 1 hr. Mesna may be coadministered with a lymphodepletant at various doses. For example, Mesna may be administered from about 1 mg/kg/day up to about 50 mg/kg/day. Mesna may be administered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, or up to about 50 mg/kg/day. In some cases, for obese or pediatric subjects a drug dosage may be calculated using practical weight. Practical weight may be an average of an actual weight and an ideal body weight. For example, ideal body weight may be calculated for a male=50 kg+2.3 (number of inches over 60 inches). An ideal body weight may be calculated for a female=45.5 kg+2.3 (number of inches over 60 inches). In some cases, a Flu administration can be 25 mg/m2/day IVPB daily over 30 minutes for 5 days. In some cases, a Flu administration can occur before a Cy administration. In some cases, a Flu administration can be performed concurrent with Cy. In some cases, a Flu administration can be performed after a Cy administration. In some cases, fludarabine can be started approximately 1 to 2 hours after the Cy and mesna. Total body irradiation can be a form of radiotherapy. As the name implies, TBI can involve irradiation of the entire body, though in modern practice the lungs can be partially shielded to lower the risk of radiation-induced lung injury. Total body irradiation can be administered at various doses. For example, total body irradiation can be administered from about 10 to about 12 Gy. In some cases, total body irradiation can be fractionated, with smaller doses delivered in several sessions, rather than delivering the entire dose at once. In some cases, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, or up to 10 different doses of irradiation can be administered. The reported D0 value—the amount of ionizing radiation necessary to eradicate a particular cell type—of hematopoietic stem cells can be from about 0.5 to about 1.4 Gy, while those of human leukemia cell lines can be from about 0.8 to about 1.5 Gy, indicating that both cells are radiosensitive. The ideal dosing schedule can depend on patient age, disease and the intended type of treatment. Myeloablative TBI can be from about 12 to about 15 Gy given in about 8 to about 12 fractions over about 4 days, with about 2 to about 3 treatments daily. In some cases, myeloablative TBI can be from about 5 to about 20 Gy. Myeloablative TBI can be from about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, to about 20 Gy. In some cases, myeloablative TBI can be given in about 5 to about 20 fractions. Myeloablative TBI can be given in about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, to about 20 fractions. Myeloablative therapy can be given over about 1 to about 10 days. Myeloablatic therapy can be administered over about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 or up to about 10 days. In some cases, a low-dose TBI can include doses of about 2 to about 8 Gy given in about 1 to about 4 fractions. In some cases, a low-dose TBI can include doses of about 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, or up to about 8 Gy. A low-dose TBI can be administered to a subject who may not tolerate myeloablation due to age or comorbidity. TBI can be administered using parallel opposed pairs of high-energy photon beams from about 4 to about 18 MV for TBI. In some cases, photon beams can be from about 1 to about 25 MV for TBI. Photon beams can be from about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, or up to about 25 MV. TCI can be performed using equipment such as a Varian Clinac iX or a Siemens Artiste. In some cases a rate of administration can be from about 5 cGy/min to about 100 cGy/min. A Rate of administration can be from about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78 79 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 95, or up to 100 cGy/min. In some cases, certain organs can be shielded during radiation. For example, a liver, lung, brain, heart, or a combination thereof may be shielded during total body irradiation. Biological Agents In some cases, a biological agent such as an antibody can be used to deplete immune cells. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that are cytolytic for lymphocytes may be an alternative means of yielding lymphocyte reduction. In some cases, an antibody for T-cell lymphocyte reduction that may be administered before anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion should be effective but short lived in vivo, to permit rapid infusion and repopulation with infused anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. Antibodies used can be directed to markers expressed on a surface of a cell, such as a lymphocyte. In some cases, lympho-reduction antibodies can be anti-CD3, anti-CD4, anti-CD8, anti-CD45, anti-CD25, anti-CD52, and any combination thereof. Antibodies such as Alemtuzumab (Campath-1H), Bortezomib, thymoglobulin (rabbit ATG, Genzyme), ATGAM (equine ATG, Pfizer), and alemtuzumab (Campath-1H) can be used. Rituximab (IDEC-C2B8), GA101, a humanized IgG1 to CD20, XmAb5574, an Fc-engineered antibody to CD19, alefacept (LFA3-Ig), fingolimod (FTY720), antithymocyte globulin (ATG), anti-CD4 antibodies, anti-CD3 antibodies, anti-CD8 antibodies, can also be used as a lymphocyte reduction agent. In some cases, Cladribine (2-CdA, Leustatin®), a purine analog similar to fludarabine, can be used. In some cases, an antibody lymphocyte reduction treatment can include a single antibody such as alemtuzumab (anti-CD52). In other cases, an antibody-based lymphocyte reduction treatment can include at least two antibodies, such as alemtuzumab and anti-CD45. In some cases, a lymphocyte reduction treatment can include multiple lympho-reduction modalities, such as radiation combined with an antibody therapy or a chemotherapy combined with radiation. Chemotherapy and antibody therapy may also be used in combination. Antibiotics, Anti-fungals and Anti-virals can be given to subjects as prophylaxis during a lymphocyte reduction treatment. For example, a prophylaxis may include Altrex 500 mg daily, Bactrium DS one tablet q M W F and Fluconazole 200 mg daily. The duration of medication is until Absolute Lymphocyte count (ALC) and Absolute Neutrophil Count (ANC) count may return to pre medication baseline. A biological agent can also be Adriamycin. One or more cytokines can be introduced with cells. Cytokines can be utilized to boost transferred cells (including adoptively transferred tumor-specific cells) to expand within a tumor microenvironment. In some cases, IL-2 can be used to facilitate expansion of the cells described herein. Cytokines such as IL-15 can also be employed. Other relevant cytokines in the field of immunotherapy can also be utilized, such as IL-2, IL-7, IL-12, and, L-21, or any combination thereof. In some cases, recombinant cytokines are used. In some cases, a T-cell growth factor can be administered. A growth factor can be administered by any suitable route. If more than one T-cell growth factor is administered, they can be administered simultaneously or sequentially, in any order, and by the same route or different routes. A T-cell growth factor, such as Aldesleukin (IL-2), can be administered intravenously as a bolus injection. A dosage of a T-cell growth factor, such as IL-2, is what is considered by those of ordinary skill in the art to be high. Preferably, a dose of about 720,000 IU/kg of IL-2 can be administered three times daily until tolerance. Is come cases, about 5 to about 15 doses of IL-2 are administered, with an average of around 9 doses. A dosage of a T cell growth factor can be from about 0 to about 20. A T cell growth factor can be administered 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, or up to about 20 times. IL-2 can be administered at a dose of 720,000 IU/kg (based on total body weight) as an intravenous bolus. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered over a 15-minute period. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered over a 20-minute period. IL-2 can be administered by immediate injection. In some cases IL-2 can be administered over 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 1 hour, 2 hours, 3 hours, 4 hours, 5 hours, or up to a period of 6 hours. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered beginning within 24 hours of cell infusion and continuing for up to about 4 days (maximum 12 doses). In some cases, IL-2 can be administered for up to about 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40 days after an initial administration. Doses of IL-2 can be administered every eight hours. In some cases, IL-2 can be administered from about every 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24 hours after an initial administration. In some cases, IL-2 dosing can be stopped if toxicities are detected. In some cases, doses can be delayed or stopped if patients reach Grade 3 or 4 toxicity due to aldesleukin except for the reversible Grade 3 toxicities common to Aldesleukin such as diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, hypotension, skin changes, anorexia, mucositis, dysphagia, or constitutional symptoms and laboratory changes. In some cases, if these toxicities can be easily reversed within 24 hours by supportive measures, then additional doses may be given. In addition, dosing may be held or stopped at the discretion of the treating physician. In some cases, an immunoresponsive cell that expresses an anti-GPC3 CAR can have increased anti-tumor efficacy compared to a comparable immunoresponsive cell that does not express the anti-GPC3 CAR. In some cases, anti-tumor efficacy can refer to cytotoxic activity. In other cases, anti-tumor efficacy can refer to persistence. Anti-tumor efficacy can also refer to the ability of a cell to target a tumor. Anti-tumor efficacy can be measured using various in vitro assays. For example, cytotoxic ability can be measured by an ELISA that measures release of interleukin-2 (IL-2) or Interferon-γ (IFNγ). Cytotoxic activity can be measured by a killing assay such as a chromium-51 release assay or a co-culture assay. In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can have increased anti-tumor efficacy and ability when compared to comparable cells. An anti-GPC3 CAR treatment efficacy can be evaluated using multiple modalities. Efficacy can refer to anti-tumor efficacy that is the extent to which a tumor, such as a GPC3-positive tumor, is controlled, reduced, or eliminated. Treatment efficacy can also refer to CAR immunoresponsive cell expansion, persistence, tumor-targeting, and any combination thereof. A subject that can be administered an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy, such as anti-GPC3 CAR T cell therapy, can be evaluated during an infusion, immediately after an infusion, or up to years following an infusion. For example, a treated subject can return to a clinic for evaluation for a period of about 1 day to the length of the subject's life. A treated subject can be evaluated from 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 60, 70, 80, or up to 90 years after an initial administration of the subject CAR immunoresponsive cells. In some cases, an evaluation schedule can include daily monitoring, weekly monitoring, monthly monitoring, or yearly monitoring. In some cases, a subject can be seen more frequently as clinically indicated. An evaluation can include a physical exam, chemistry evaluation, complete blood count, thyroid panel, toxicity assessment, computerized tomography (CT) scan of a bodily area, apheresis, and any combination thereof. In some cases, apheresis may be performed prior to and from about 1 to about 10 weeks following administration of a subject CAR immunoresponsive cell infusion. At other time points, a subject's peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) can be obtained from whole blood by purification using centrifugation on a Ficoll gradiant. Aliquots of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC5) can be cryopreserved for immunological monitoring of cell function. In some cases, a variety of tests can include evaluation of specific lysis and cytokine release, metabolomic and bioenergetic studies (using Seahorse), intracellular FACS of cytokine production, ELISA-spot assays, and lymphocyte subset analysis may be used to evaluate the immunological correlates of a subject CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment. In general, differences of about 2 to about 3 fold in these assays may be indicative of true biologic differences. In some cases, different of about 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, up to about 5 fold of in vitro assays, post anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy, may be indicative of treatment efficacy. In some cases, a subject CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment may reduce tumor size by at least 30% as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scan or an MRI. An anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment may reduce tumor size by at least about 5%, 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, or up to about 100%. A CAR-T treatment may eliminate a tumor as measured by CT scan. In some cases, an anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell treatment may stabilize a tumor size as measured by a less than 10% change in a baseline measurement of a diameter of a tumor lesion as measured by computerized tomography (CT) scan. For example, a tumor may not expand in size after administration of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. In some cases, stabilization may be considered a less than 10%, 9%, 8%, 7%, 6%, 5%, 4%, 3%, 2%, or 1% change in tumor size as compared to a pre-treatment measurement. In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell efficacy can be considered in terms of subject survival time. For example, a subject that is treated with anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as an anti-GPC3 CAR T cells, can survive longer than an untreated subject or a subject treated with a different therapy. In some cases, anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell efficacy can be improved by the addition of a secondary treatment, such as lymphocyte reduction treatment. A secondary treatment can synergize with a anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy. In some cases, a secondary treatment can produce additive effects of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy. A secondary treatment can be lymphocyte reduction as well as additional forms of cellular therapy, antibody therapy, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, surgery, anti-angiogenic therapy, and any combination thereof. Treatment response can be evaluated using the international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (Version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of a tumor lesion and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes can be used in the RECIST criteria. For example, measurable lesions can be those defined as those that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as >20 mm by chest x-ray, as >10 mm with CT scan, or >10 mm with calipers by clinical exam. To be considered pathologically enlarged and measurable, a lymph node can be >15 mm in short axis when assessed by CT scan. All other lesions (or sites of disease), including small lesions (longest diameter <10 mm or pathological lymph nodes with ≥10 to <15 mm short axis), can be considered non-measurable disease. Bone lesions, leptomeningeal disease, ascites, pleural/pericardial effusions, lymphangitis cutis/pulmonitis, inflammatory breast disease, can be considered as non-measurable. All measurable lesions up to a maximum of 2 lesions per organ and 5 lesions in total, representative of all involved organs, can be identified as target lesions and recorded and measured at baseline. Target lesions can be selected on the basis of their size (lesions with the longest diameter), be representative of all involved organs, but in addition should be those that lend themselves to reproducible repeated measurements. It may be the case that, on occasion, the largest lesion does not lend itself to reproducible measurement in which circumstance the next largest lesion which can be measured reproducibly should be selected. A sum of the diameters (longest for non-nodal lesions, short axis for nodal lesions) for all target lesions can be calculated and reported as the baseline sum diameters. If lymph nodes are to be included in the sum, then only the short axis can be added into the sum. A baseline sum diameter will be used as reference to further characterize any objective tumor regression in the measurable dimension of the disease. In some cases, a clinical lesion can be considered measurable when it can be superficial (e.g., skin nodules and palpable lymph nodes) and about 10 mm diameter as assessed using calipers (e.g., skin nodules). In cases, where a caliper cannot be used to measure a lesion, a CT scan or MRI can also be used. In some cases, a CT scan can yield slices of tissue from about 5 mm or less. A CT scan can have 5 mm, 4 mm, 3 mm, 2 mm, 1 mm or 0.5 mm scan thickness in some cases. If a CT scan has a slice thickness greater than 5 mm, a minimum size for a measurable lesion can be twice the slice thickness. In some cases, an MRI can also be performed to evaluate a subject. Ideally, the same type of scanner should be used and the image acquisition protocol should be followed as closely as possible to prior scans when determining treatment efficacy. Body scans should be performed with breath-hold scanning techniques, if possible. In some cases, a fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron emission tomography (PET) can be used to measure treatment efficacy. Once a subject has been evaluated, target lesions can be grouped into stable disease (SD), progressive disease (PD), partial response (PR), and/or a complete response (CR). A SD can be considered neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for PR nor sufficient increase to qualify for PD, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters. A PD can be considered at least a 20% increase in the sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum (this can include the baseline sum if that may be the smallest). In some cases, in addition to a relative increase of about 20%, a sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least about 5 mm. A PR can be at least about 30% decrease in a sum of the diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters. A CR can be elimination of target lesions. In some cases, administration of anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as anti-GPC3 CAR T cells, and a lymphocyte reduction treatment can synergistically increase a subject's median survival time by at least about 6 months as compared to administering the anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cells alone, Table 6. In some cases, a combination of an anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cell therapy and a lymphocyte reduction treatment can synergistically increase a subject's survival time by at least about 1 month, 2 months, 3 months, 4 months, 5 months, 6 months, 7 months, 8 months, 9 months, 10 months, 11 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years, 5 years, 6 years, 7 years, 8 years, 9 years, 10 years, or up to about 25 years as compared to administering the anti-GPC3-CAR immunoresponsive cells alone.

 Subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells can be formulation into a pharmaceutical medicament and be used to treat a human or mammal, in need thereof, diagnosed with a disease, e.g., cancer. These pharmaceutical medicaments can be co-administered to a human or mammal, together with one or more chemotherapeutic agent or chemotherapeutic compound. Populations of subject CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as CAR T cells, may be formulated for administration to a subject using techniques known to the skilled artisan. Formulations comprising populations of CAR immunoresponsive cells may include pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s). Excipients included in the formulations will have different purposes depending, for example, on the subpopulation of T cells used and the mode of administration. Examples of generally used excipients included, without limitation: saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water-for-injection, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof, stabilizing agents, solubilizing agents and surfactants, buffers and preservatives, tonicity agents, bulking agents, and lubricating agents. The formulations comprising populations of CAR immunoresponsive cells will typically have been prepared and cultured in the absence of any non-human components, such as animal serum. A formulation may include one population of CAR immunoresposive cells, or more than one, such as two, three, four, five, six or more populations of CAR immunoresposive cells. For example, a formulation may include one population of CAR T cells, or more than one, such as two, three, four, five, six or more populations of CAR T cells. Formulations comprising population(s) of anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells may be administered to a subject using modes and techniques known to the skilled artisan. Exemplary modes include, but are not limited to, intravenous injection. Other modes include, without limitation, intratumoral, intradermal, subcutaneous (S.C., s.q., sub-Q, Hypo), intramuscular (i.m.), intraperitoneal (i.p.), intra-arterial, intramedullary, intracardiac, intra-articular (joint), intrasynovial (joint fluid area), intracranial, intraspinal, and intrathecal (spinal fluids). Any known device useful for parenteral injection of infusion of the formulations can be used to effect such administration. Formulations comprising population(s) of CAR immunoresponsive cells that are administered to a subject comprise a number of CAR immunoresponsive cells that is effective for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of the specific indication or disease. Thus, therapeutically-effective populations of CAR immunoresponsive cells can be administered to subjects. In general, formulations are administered that comprise between about 1×104 and about 1×1010 CAR immunoresponsive cells. In most cases, the formulation will comprise between about 1×105 and about 1×109 CAR immunoresponsive cells, from about 5×105 to about 5×108 CAR immunoresponsive cells, or from about 1×106 to about 1×107 CAR immunoresponsive cells. However, the number of CAR immunoresponsive cells administered to a subject will vary between wide limits, depending upon the location, source, identity, extent and severity of the cancer, the age and condition of the individual to be treated etc. A physician will ultimately determine appropriate dosages to be used. Tumor-targeting molecules are administered to a subject prior to, or concurrent with, or after administration of the CAR immunoresponsive cells. The tumor-targeting molecules bind to target cells in the subject by association to a tumor-associated antigen or a tumor-specific antigen. The tumor-targeting molecules may be formulated for administration to a subject using techniques known to the skilled artisan. Formulations of the tumor-targeting molecules may include pharmaceutically acceptable excipient(s). Examples of generally used excipients include, without limitation: saline, buffered saline, dextrose, water-for-injection, glycerol, ethanol, and combinations thereof, stabilizing agents, solubilizing agents and surfactants, buffers and preservatives, tonicity agents bulking agents, and lubricating agents. The tumor-targeting molecules may be administered to a subject using modes and techniques known to the skilled artisan. Exemplary modes include, but are not limited to, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and intratumoral injection. Other modes include, without limitation, intradermal, subcutaneous (S.C., s.q., sub-Q, Hypo), intramuscular (i.m.), intra-arterial, intramedullary, intracardiac, intra-articular (joint), intrasynovial (joint fluid area), intracranial, intraspinal, and intrathecal (spinal fluids). In some cases, a CAR-T may be locally administered at a tumor lesion, such as a liver lesion. Any known device useful for parenteral injection or infusion of the formulations can be used to effect such administration. Formulations comprising the tumor-targeting molecules are administered to a subject in an amount that is effective for treating and/or prophylaxis of the specific indication or disease. In general, formulations comprising at least about 0.1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the tumor-targeting molecules are administered to a subject in need of treatment. In most cases, the dosage is from about 1 mg/kg to about 100 mg/kg body weight of the tagged proteins daily, taking into account the routes of administration, symptoms, etc. A physician will determine appropriate dosages to be used. In one embodiment, a chimeric antigen receptor is used for stimulating an immunoresponsive cell-mediated immune response. For example, a T cell-mediated immune response is an immune response that involves the activation of T cells. Activated antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells are able to induce apoptosis in target cells displaying epitopes of foreign antigens on their surface, such as for example cancer cells displaying tumor antigens. In another embodiment, a chimeric antigen receptor is used to provide anti-tumor immunity in the mammal Due to a T cell-mediated immune response the subject will develop an anti-tumor immunity. In certain cases, methods of treating a subject having cancer can involve administering to a subject in need of treatment one or more formulations of tumor-targeting molecules, wherein these molecules bind to a cancer cell, and administering one or more therapeutically-effective populations of subject CAR immunoresponsive cells, wherein the CAR immunoresponsive cells can bind the tumor-targeting molecules and induce cancer cell death. Another embodiment can relate to methods of treating a subject having cancer comprising administering to a subject in need of treatment one or more therapeutically-effective populations of subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, wherein the CAR immunoresponsive cells bind to a cancer cell, thereby inducing cancer cell death. Administration frequencies of both formulations comprising anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells and anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells in combination with tumor-targeting molecules will vary depending on factors that include the disease being treated, the elements comprising the CAR immunoresponsive cells and the tumor-targeting molecules, and the modes of administration. Each formulation may be independently administered 4, 3, 2, or once daily, every other day, every third day, every fourth day, every fifth day, every sixth day, once weekly, every eight days, every nine days, every ten days, bi-weekly, monthly and bi-monthly.

In one embodiment, the anti-cancer drug is 5-fluorouracil, taxol, or leucovorin. In some cases, subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell can be introduced by injection, catheter, or the like. In some cases, immunostimulatory agents can also be included, including, but not limited to, interleukins, e.g. IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, and IL-11, as well as the other interleukins, the colony stimulating factors, such as G-, M- and GM-CSF, interferons, e.g. .gamma.-interferon and erythropoietin. In some cases, a subject can be treated with a CAR-T, immunodepletant, and immunostimulant. A subject can be treated with IL-2 to boost performance of a CAR-T cellular product. In some cases, an immunostimulant can be a recombinant protein. An immunostimulant can also comprise an active portion of a protein. In some cases, an immunostimulant may only comprise a portion of a protein. A portion of a protein can be from about 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or up to about 100% of a protein. Compositions comprising subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, such as CAR T cells, can be conveniently provided as sterile liquid preparations, e.g., isotonic aqueous solutions, suspensions, emulsions, dispersions, or viscous compositions, which may be buffered to a selected pH. Liquid preparations are normally easier to prepare than gels, other viscous compositions, and solid compositions. Additionally, liquid compositions are somewhat more convenient to administer, especially by injection. Viscous compositions, on the other hand, can be formulated within the appropriate viscosity range to provide longer contact periods with specific tissues. Liquid or viscous compositions can comprise carriers, which can be a solvent or dispersing medium containing, for example, water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like) and suitable mixtures thereof. Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating genetically modified CAR immunoresponsive cells utilized in practicing the present invention in a required amount of the appropriate solvent with various amounts of the other ingredients, as desired. Such compositions may be in admixture with a suitable carrier, diluent, or excipient such as sterile water, physiological saline, glucose, dextrose, or the like. The compositions can also be lyophilized. The compositions can contain auxiliary substances such as wetting, dispersing, or emulsifying agents (e.g., methylcellulose), pH buffering agents, gelling or viscosity enhancing additives, preservatives, flavoring agents, colors, and the like, depending upon the route of administration and the preparation desired. Standard texts, such as “REMINGTON'S PHARMACEUTICAL SCIENCE”, 17th edition, 1985, incorporated herein by reference, may be consulted to prepare suitable preparations, without undue experimentation. Various additives which may enhance stability and sterility of the compositions, including antimicrobial preservatives, antioxidants, chelating agents, and buffers, can be added. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. According to the present invention, however, any vehicle, diluent, or additive used would have to be compatible with the genetically modified CAR immunoresponsive cells or their progenitors. In some cases, compositions can be isotonic, i.e., they can have the same osmotic pressure as blood and lacrimal fluid. The desired isotonicity of the compositions of this invention may be accomplished using sodium chloride, or other pharmaceutically acceptable agents such as dextrose, boric acid, sodium tartrate, propylene glycol or other inorganic or organic solutes. Sodium chloride is preferred particularly for buffers containing sodium ions. Viscosity of compositions, if desired, can be maintained at the selected level using a pharmaceutically acceptable thickening agent. Methylcellulose is preferred because it is readily and economically available and is easy to work with. Other suitable thickening agents include, for example, xanthan gum, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, carbomer, and the like. The preferred concentration of the thickener will depend upon the agent selected. The important point is to use an amount that will achieve the selected viscosity. Obviously, the choice of suitable carriers and other additives will depend on the exact route of administration and the nature of the particular dosage form, e.g., liquid dosage form (e.g., whether the composition is to be formulated into a solution, a suspension, gel or another liquid form, such as a time release form or liquid-filled form). In some cases, for example, in the compositions, formulations and methods of treating cancer, the unit dosage of the composition or formulation administered can be 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 or 100 mg. In some cases, the total amount of the composition or formulation administered can be 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 g. In some cases, a pharmaceutical composition comprising a subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cell, such as a CAR T cell, can be administered either alone or together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient, by any routes, and such administration can be carried out in both single and multiple dosages. More particularly, the pharmaceutical composition can be combined with various pharmaceutically acceptable inert carriers in the form of tablets, capsules, lozenges, troches, hand candies, powders, sprays, aqueous suspensions, injectable solutions, elixirs, syrups, and the like. Such carriers include solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous media and various non-toxic organic solvents, etc. Moreover, such oral pharmaceutical formulations can be suitably sweetened and/or flavored by means of various agents of the type commonly employed for such purposes. For example, cells can be administered to a patient in conjunction with (e.g., before, simultaneously, or following) any number of relevant treatment modalities, including but not limited to treatment with agents such as antiviral therapy, cidofovir and interleukin-2, or Cytarabine (also known as ARA-C). In some cases, the engineered cells can be used in combination with chemotherapy, radiation, immunosuppressive agents, such as cyclosporin, azathioprine, methotrexate, mycophenolate, and FK506, antibodies, or other immunoablative agents such as CAMPATH, anti-CD3 antibodies or other antibody therapies, cytoxin, fludaribine, cyclosporin, FK506, rapamycin, mycoplienolic acid, steroids, FR901228, cytokines, and irradiation. The engineered cell composition can also be administered to a patient in conjunction with (e.g., before, simultaneously or following) bone marrow transplantation, T cell ablative therapy using either chemotherapy agents such as, fludarabine, external-beam radiation therapy (XRT), cyclophosphamide, or antibodies such as OKT3 or CAMPATH. In some cases, the engineered cell compositions can be administered following B-cell ablative therapy such as agents that react with CD20, e.g., Rituxan. For example, subjects can undergo standard treatment with high dose chemotherapy followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplantation. In certain embodiments, following the transplant, subjects can receive an infusion of the engineered cells, e.g., expanded engineered cells. Additionally, expanded engineered cells can be administered before or following surgery. The engineered cells obtained by any one of the methods described herein can be used for treating patients in need thereof against Host versus Graft (HvG) rejection and Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD). Therefore, a method of treating patients in need thereof against Host versus Graft (HvG) rejection and Graft versus Host Disease (GvHD) comprising treating said patient by administering to said patient an effective amount of engineered cells comprising inactivated TCR alpha and/or TCR beta genes can be contemplated.

The practice of the invention employs, unless otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of molecular biology (including recombinant techniques), microbiology, cell biology, biochemistry and immunology, which are within the skill of the art. Such techniques are explained fully in the literature, such as, “Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual”, second edition (Sambrook et al., 1989); “Oligonucleotide Synthesis” (Gait, ed., 1984); “Animal Cell Culture” (Freshney, ed., 1987); “Methods in Enzymology” (Academic Press, Inc.); “Handbook of Experimental Immunology” (Wei & Blackwell, eds.); “Gene Transfer Vectors for Mammalian Cells” (Miller & Calos, eds., 1987); “Current Protocols in Molecular Biology” (Ausubel et al., eds., 1987); “PCR: The Polymerase Chain Reaction”, (Mullis et al., eds., 1994); and “Current Protocols in Immunology” (Coligan et al., eds., 1991). These techniques are applicable to the production of the polynucleotides and polypeptides, and, as such, can be considered in making and practicing the invention. Particularly useful techniques for are discussed in the sections that follow. Additional Applications Effective adoptive cell transfer-based immunotherapies (ACT) can be useful to treat cancer (e.g., metastatic cancer) patients. For example, autologous peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) can be modified using non-viral or viral methods disclosed herein to express an anti-GPC3 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) that recognizes GPC3 on cancer or tumor cells and can be used in the disclosed methods and kits. The present invention can be directed to compositions and methods for immunotherapy, including but not limited to cancer, using a human or humanized chimeric antigen receptor following or concurrent with a lymphocyte reduction treatment to a subject. This chimeric antigen receptor makes use of human or humanized chimeric antigen receptor constructs following or concurrent with a lymphocyte reduction treatment to a subject. These compositions and methods can provide a cancer therapy with many advantages. In some cases, a method can include modifying immunoresponsive cells to render the immunoresponsive cells substantially non-dependent upon the presence or activity of a major histocompatibility complex (MHC). In some cases, a polynucleic acid described herein can encode for a chimeric antigen receptor. Also disclosed are methods of making immunoresponsive cells expressing chimeric antigen receptors, such as anti-GPC3 CAR. Disclosed can also be a method of treatment in which patients with a cancer or disease can be administered anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells. Described herein is a method of treating a disease (e.g., cancer) in a recipient comprising transplanting to the recipient one or more subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells following or concurrently with lymphocyte reduction treatment. Autologous lymphocyte infusion can be used in a treatment. Autologous peripheral blood monocytes (PBMCs) can be collected from a patient in need of treatment and T cells can be activated and expanded using methods described herein and known in the art and then infused back into the patient. In other cases, allogenic cells can be used to treat a patient. Populations of subject CAR immunoresponsive cells may be formulated for administration; and wherein the administration to a subject using techniques known to the skilled artisan. Expanded cells can then be grown under conditions similar to those for unmodified cells, whereby the modified ceils can be expanded and used for a variety of purposes. The method disclosed herein can comprise transplanting. Transplantation can refer to adoptive transplantation of a cellular product. Transplanting can be autotransplanting, allotransplanting, xenotransplanting, or any other transplanting. For example, transplanting can be xenotransplanting. Transplanting can also be allotransplanting. In some cases, about 5×1010 subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells are administered to a subject. In some embodiments, about 5×1010 cells represents a median amount of cells administered to a subject. In some embodiments, about 5×1010 cells are necessary to affect a therapeutic response in a subject. In some embodiments, at least about at least about 1×107 cells, at least about 2×107 cells, at least about 3×107 cells, at least about 4×107 cells, at least about 5×107 cells, at least about 6×107 cells, at least about 6×107 cells, at least about 8×107 cells, at least about 9×107 cells, at least about 1×108 cells, at least about 2×108 cells, at least about 3×108 cells, at least about 4×108 cells, at least about 5×108 cells, at least about 6×108 cells, at least about 6×108 cells, at least about 8×108 cells, at least about 9×108 cells, at least about 1×109 cells, at least about 2×109 cells, at least about 3×109 cells, at least about 4×109 cells, at least about 5×109 cells, at least about 6×109 cells, at least about 6×109 cells, at least about 8×109 cells, at least about 9×109 cells, at least about 1×1010 cells, at least about 2×1010 cells, at least about 3×1010 cells, at least about 4×1010 cells, at least about 5×1010 cells, at least about 6×1010 cells, at least about 6×1010 cells, at least about 8×1010 cells, at least about 9×1010 cells, at least about 1×1011 cells, at least about 2×1011 cells, at least about 3×1011 cells, at least about 4×1011 cells, at least about 5×1011 cells, at least about 6×1011 cells, at least about 6×1011 cells, at least about 8×1011 cells, at least about 9×1011 cells, or at least about 1×1012 cells. For example, about 5×1010 cells may be administered to a subject. In another example, starting with 3×106 cells, the cells may be expanded to about 5×1010 cells and administered to a subject. In some cases, cells are expanded to sufficient numbers for therapy. For example, 5×107 cells can undergo rapid expansion to generate sufficient numbers for therapeutic use. In some cases, sufficient numbers for therapeutic use can be 5×1010. Any number of cells can be infused for therapeutic use. For example, a subject may be infused with a number of cells between 1×106 to 5×1012 inclusive. A patient may be infused with as many cells that can be generated for them. In some cases, cells that are infused into a patient are not all engineered. For example, at least 90% of cells that are infused into a patient can be engineered. In other instances, at least 40% of cells that are infused into a patient can be engineered. In some embodiments, a method can comprise calculating and/or administering to a subject an amount of engineered cells necessary to affect a therapeutic response in the subject. In some embodiments, calculating the amount of engineered cells necessary to affect a therapeutic response comprises the viability of the cells and/or the efficiency with which an anti-GPC3 CAR transgene has been integrated into the genome of a cell. In some embodiments, in order to affect a therapeutic response in a subject, the cells administered to the subject may be viable cells. In some embodiments, in order to effect a therapeutic response in a subject, at least about 95%, at least about 90%, at least about 85%, at least about 80%, at least about 75%, at least about 70%, at least about 65%, at least about 60%, at least about 55%, at least about 50%, at least about 45%, at least about 40%, at least about 35%, at least about 30%, at least about 25%, at least about 20%, at least about 15%, at least about 10% of the cells are viable cells. In some embodiments, in order to affect a therapeutic response in a subject, the cells administered to a subject may be cells that have had one or more transgenes successfully integrated into the genome of the cell. In some embodiments, in order to effect a therapeutic response in a subject, at least about 95%, at least about 90%, at least about 85%, at least about 80%, at least about 75%, at least about 70%, at least about 65%, at least about 60%, at least about 55%, at least about 50%, at least about 45%, at least about 40%, at least about 35%, at least about 30%, at least about 25%, at least about 20%, at least about 15%, at least about 10% of the cells have had one or more CAR transgenes successfully integrated into a genome of a cell. In some cases, a subject can be administered subject anti-GPC3 CAR immunoresponsive cells, wherein CAR immunoresponsive cells that can be administered may be about 1 to about 35 days old. For example, administered cells may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, or up to about 40 days old. An age of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be considered from a time of stimulation. An age of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be considered from a time of apheresis. An age of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be considered from a time of transduction. In some embodiments, CAR immunoresponsive cell that can be administered to a subject are about 10 to about 14 or about 20 days old. In some cases, an “age” of a CAR immunoresponsive cell can be determined by a length of a telomere. For example, a “young” CAR immunoresponsive cell can have a longer telomere length than an “exhausted” or “old” CAR immunoresponsive cell. Without being bound to a particular theory, it can be believed that immunoresponsive cells lose an estimated telomere length of about 0.8 kb per week in culture, and that young CAR immunoresponsive cell cultures can have telomeres that are about 1.4 kb longer than immunoresponsive cells that are about 44 days old. Without being bound to a particular theory, it is believed that longer telomere lengths can be associated with positive objective clinical responses in patients and persistence of the cells in vivo. In some cases, cells are isolated from the subject organism, transfected with a nucleic acid (e.g., gene or cDNA), and re-infused back into the subject organism (e.g., patient). Cells (e.g., engineered cells or engineered primary T cells) before, after, and/or during transplantation can be functional. For example, transplanted cells can be functional for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 6, 27, 28, 29, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, or 100 days after transplantation. Transplanted cells can be functional for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, or 12 months after transplantation. Transplanted cells can be functional for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, or 30 years after transplantation. In some cases, transplanted cells can be functional for up to the lifetime of a recipient. Further, transplanted cells can function at 100% of their normal intended function. Transplanted cells can also function 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, or up to about 100% of their normal intended function. Transplanted cells can also function over 100% of their normal intended function. For example, transplanted cells can function 110, 120, 130, 140, 150, 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, 250, 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 800, 900, 1000, or up to about 5000% of their normal intended function. Transplanting can be by any type of transplanting. Sites can include, but not limited to, liver subcapsular space, splenic subcapsular space, renal subcapsular space, omentum, gastric or intestinal submucosa, vascular segment of small intestine, venous sac, testis, brain, spleen, or cornea. For example, transplanting can be subcapsular transplanting. Transplanting can also be intramuscular transplanting. Transplanting can be intraportal transplanting. After treatment (e.g., any of the treatment as disclosed herein), transplant rejection can be improved as compared to when one or more wild-type cells is transplanted into a recipient. For example, transplant rejection can be hyperacute rejection. Transplant rejection can also be acute rejection. Other types of rejection can include chronic rejection. Transplant rejection can also be cell-mediated rejection or T cell-mediated rejection. Transplant rejection can also be natural killer cell-mediated rejection. Improving transplantation can mean lessening hyperacute rejection, which can encompass a decrease, lessening, or diminishing of an undesirable effect or symptom. Transplantation can refer to adoptive transplantation of a cellular product. Another indication of successful transplantation can be the days a recipient does not require immunosuppressive therapy. For example, after treatment (e.g., transplantation) provided herein, a recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least or at least about 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more days. This can indicate that transplantation was successful. This can also indicate that there is no rejection of the transplanted cells, tissues, and/or organs. In some cases, a recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1 day. A recipient can also require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 7 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 14 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 21 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 28 days. A recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 60 days. Furthermore, a recipient can require no immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, or more years. Another indication of successful transplantation can be the days a recipient requires reduced immunosuppressive therapy. For example, after the said treatment provided herein, a recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more days. This can indicate that transplantation was successful. This can also indicate that there is no or minimal rejection of the transplanted cells, tissues, and/or organs. For example, a recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1 day. A recipient can also require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 7 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 14 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 21 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 28 days. A recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 60 days. Furthermore, a recipient can require reduced immunosuppressive therapy for at least 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 or more years. Reduced immunosuppressive therapy can refer to less immunosuppressive therapy compared to a required immunosuppressive therapy when one or more wild-type cells is transplanted into a recipient. Immunosuppressive therapy can comprise any treatment that suppresses the immune system. Immunosuppressive therapy can help to alleviate, minimize, or eliminate transplant rejection in a recipient. For example, immunosuppressive therapy can comprise immuno-suppressive drugs. Immunosuppressive drugs that can be used before, during and/or after transplant, but are not limited to, MMF (mycophenolate mofetil (Cellcept)), ATG (anti-thymocyte globulin), anti-CD154 (CD40L), anti-CD40 (2C10, ASKP1240, CCFZ533X2201), alemtuzumab (Campath), anti-CD20 (rituximab), anti-IL-6R antibody (tocilizumab, Actemra), anti-IL-6 antibody (sarilumab, olokizumab), CTLA4-Ig (Abatacept/Orencia), belatacept (LEA29Y), sirolimus (Rapimune), everolimus, tacrolimus (Prograf), daclizumab (Ze-napax), basiliximab (Simulect), infliximab (Remicade), cyclosporin, deoxyspergualin, soluble complement receptor 1, cobra venom factor, compstatin, anti C5 antibody (eculizumab/Soliris), methylprednisolone, FTY720, everolimus, leflunomide, anti-IL-2R-Ab, rapamycin, anti-CXCR3 antibody, anti-ICOS antibody, anti-OX40 antibody, and anti-CD122 antibody. Furthermore, one or more than one immunosuppressive agents/drugs can be used together or sequentially. One or more than one immunosuppressive agents/drugs can be used for induction therapy or for maintenance therapy. The same or different drugs can be used during induction and maintenance stages. In some cases, daclizumab (Zenapax) can be used for induction therapy and tacrolimus (Prograf) and sirolimus (Rapimune) can be used for maintenance therapy. Daclizumab (Zenapax) can also be used for induction therapy and low dose tacrolimus (Prograf) and low dose sirolimus (Rapimune) can be used for maintenance therapy Immunosuppression can also be achieved using non-drug regimens including, but not limited to, whole body irradiation, thymic irradiation, and full and/or partial splenectomy. These techniques can also be used in combination with one or more immuno-suppressive drugs. EXAMPLES The invention is further described in detail by reference to the following experimental examples. These examples are provided for purposes of illustration only, and are not intended to be limiting unless otherwise specified. Thus, the invention should in no way be construed as being limited to the following examples, but rather, should be construed to encompass any and all variations which become evident as a result of the teaching provided herein. Example 1: Construction of Anti-GPC3-CAR Vector An exemplary lentiviral plasmid vector was constructed using a third-generation of self-inactivating lentiviral vector system. The system contains packaging plasmid pMDLg RRE encoding Gag/Pol (Addgene), packaging plasmid pRSV-REV encoding Rev (Addgene), envelope plasmid pCMV-VSV-G encoding VSV-G (Addgene), and a recombinant expression vector encoding a CAR gene based in an empty vector pRRLSIN-cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE (Addgene). The system can effectively lower the risk of forming replication capable lentivirus (RCL) particles. The empty vector pRRLSIN-cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE contains a promoter of elongation factor-1 α (EF-1α), and insert MluI cleavage site between the promoter and CD8αsp signal peptide. Specifically, the pWPT-EGFP vector (Addgene) was double digested with ClaI/SalI (NEB) to recover DNA fragments of 1.1 Kb, which were then ligated with T4 DNA ligase to pRRLSIN-cPPT.PGK-GFP.WPRE which was double digested with ClaI/SalI. The ligation mixture was then transformed into host cell TOP10. Positive clones were identified by colony PCR and confirmed by sequencing, giving rise to recombinant plasmid pRRLSIN-cPPT.EF-1α-EGFP.WPRE. EF-1α promoter (SEQ ID NO: 33, including Mlu I cleavage site) of the CD8a signal domain (aka Fragment 1, 442 bp) was amplified with upstream primer 5′-gcaggggaaagaatagtagaca-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 31), downstream primer 5′-CGGCCTGGCGGCGTGGAG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 32), and pRRLSIN-cPPT.EF-1α-EGFP.WPRE as template, and the amplification was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 30 s, annealing at 53° C. for 30 s, and extension at 68° C. for 30 s; and after 25 cycles, extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The amplified band was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis to have the expected fragment size. Humanized antibody 35 has been described in Chinese Patent Application No. CN201510481235.1, which is capable of specifically recognizing humanized GPC3 protein. To construct 35-CAR lentiviral plasmid, the following were used in amplification to provide heavy chain variable domain fragment: fragment containing heavy chain variable domain 35 (SEQ ID NO: 80 in CN201510481235.1) as template, upstream primer 5′-ctccacgccgccaggccggaggtgcagctggtgcag-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 34), and downstream primer 5′-GCGGTGTCCTCGCTCCGCAGGCTGCTCAGCTCCATGTAGGCGGTG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 35); the following were used to provide light chain variable domain fragment: fragment containing light chain variable domain of 35 (SEQ ID NO: 79 CN201510481235.1 as template, upstream primer 5′-GCGGAGCGAGGACACCGCCGTGTACTACTGCGCCCGGTTCTACAGCTAC-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 36), and downstream primer 5′-CGGCGCTGGCGTCGTGGTACG TTTGATCTCCAGCTTGGTG-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 37). The heavy chain and light chain variable domain primers were amplified with bridging PCR to provide 35 scFv fragment (SEQ ID NO: 38, aka Fragment 2, 765 bp), which comprises a sequence repetitive to the upstream CD8a signal peptide and the downstream hinge region. PCR amplification was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 40 s, annealing at 58° C. for 40 s; extension at 68° C. for 40 s; and after 25 cycles, an extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The amplified band was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis to have the expected fragment size. The upstream primer 5′-accacgacgccagcgccg-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 39) and downstream primer 5′-aatccagaggttgattgtcgacctagcgagggggcagggcctgc-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 40) were used, with pWPT-eGFP-F2A-GPC3-28Z as a template (See Chinese Patent Application CN 104140974 A), to amplify Hinge-28Z (SEQ ID NO: 41, Fragment 3, 703 bp) (with internal Sal I cleavage site). PCR amplification was conducted under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 30 s; annealing at 60° C. for 30 s; extension at 68° C. for 30 s; and after 25 cycles, final extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The amplified band was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis to have the expected fragment size. An equimolar amount (about 50 ng) of Fragment 1, Fragment 2 and Fragment 3 were amplified by overlap PCR under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 40 s; annealing at 60° C. for 40 s; extension at 68° C. for 140 s; and after 5 cycles, final extension at 68° C. for 10 min. DNA polymerase, upstream primer 5′-gcaggggaaagaatagtagaca-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 31) and downstream primer 5′-aatccagaggttgattgtcgacctagcgagggggcagggcctgc-3′ (SEQ ID NO: 40) were then supplemented to the mixture, and amplified for 25 cycles under the following conditions: initial denaturation at 94° C. for 4 min; denaturation at 94° C. for 40 s; annealing at 60° C. for 40 s; extension at 68° C. for 140 s; and final extension at 68° C. for 10 min. The theoretical size of the resulting 35-28Z (SEQ ID NO: 41) was 1874 bp. The amplified product was confirmed by agarose gel electrophoresis and had the expected fragment size, and sequence as shown as SEQ ID NO: 23. The vector pRRLSIN-cPPT.EF-1α-EGFP.WPRE vector and 35-28Z were digested with MluI and SalI, and then ligated with T4 ligase, and transformed into TOP10. Positive clones were identified with colony PCR and sequenced by Invitrogen to confirm that pRRL-EF-1α-35-28Z was obtained. Example 2: Packaging of Anti-GPC3-CAR Lentivirus Anti-GPC3-CAR lentivirus stock solution (0.75 L) was prepared using Embryonic Kidney Cells 293 T (ATCC: CRL-11268). Specifically, 293T cells were seeded at 1.17×104/cm2 onto a 5-layer cellstack (Corning). Solution A was prepared at the day of transfection to comprise 133.2 μg of packaging plasmid pRSV-Rev, 133.2 μg of pMDLg/pRRE, 51.56 μg of pCMV-VSV-G and 111.7 μg of pRRL-EF-1α-35-28Z, by dissolving 966 μg of all the plasmid into 17 ml DMEM basal medium and gently mixing it. Solution B was prepared by dissolving 2.9 mg PEI (Polysciences) into 17 ml DMEM basal medium, and the solution was gently mixed and incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Solution A was then introduced into Solution B, homogenously mixed, and allowed to stand still at room temperature for 20 min to 25 min. The 293 T culture solution was then transferred from a Cellstack into a 1 L flask. The combined solution comprising plasmid and PEI was then introduced into the culture solution and mixed gently. The resulting solution was then transferred into a Cellstack, and incubated for 5 h at 37° C., 5% CO2 before the medium was changed to fresh growth medium DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Life Technology). The culture was then incubated at 37° C., 5% CO2 for 48 h. The lentiviral stock solution was then recovered, filtered with a 0.45 μm (Millipore) filter, concentrated and purified with KrosFlo® IIi Tangential Flow Filtration System (Spectrum), and washed with AIM-V(Life technology) and stored. Titration of virus was conducted according to the method described in CN104140974A. Virus titer was calculated to be about 1×108/ml. The virus was packaged at 1×108/vial, and stored at −80° C. for later use. Example 3: Preparation of Anti-GPC3-CAR T Cells and In Vitro Anti-Tumor Assay Against Liver Cancer Cells CAR T cells were prepared in an immune cell preparatory lab following cGMP standards. Specifically, peripheral blood of subjects or white blood cell enriched blood obtained using a COBE Spectra blood component separator were separated by density gradient centrifugation to obtain human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). PBMCs were mixed with magnetic beads coated with both anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies (Life technology) at a ratio of PMBC to magnetic beads of 1:3, stimulated with recombinant human IL-2 at a final concentration of 300 U/mL (Shanghai Hua Xin High Biotechnology Co., Ltd.) and cultivated for 48 h. Subsequently, the aforementioned lentivirus was used to transduce the activated T cells at MOI of approximately 5, with efficiency of transduction enhanced by RetroNectin (Takara). 24 h and 48 h following transduction, free viruses were removed by medium change through low-speed centrifugation (100 g×10 min). 72 h following transduction, the magnetic beads were removed. The aforementioned centrifugation was repeated, and a sub-culture was obtained at a density of 5×105/mL. Subsequently, the cells were sub-cultured every other day at a density of about 3×105/mL while recombinant human IL-2 was added into the lymphocyte culture medium at a final concentration of 300 U/mL. The transduced CAR T cells were assayed for their expression of CAR by flow cytometry following in vitro cultivation for 10 to 12 days. That is, positive transduction rates of the CAR T cells were assayed and are shown in Table 7. Moreover, an in vitro anti-tumor assay was conducted by co-incubation with high GPC3 expressing liver cancer cells Huh-7, low GPC3 expressing PLC/PRF/5, and GPC3 negative SK-HEP-1 for 18 h at an effector to target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. For a detailed procedure, refer to CN104140974A. In vitro anti-tumor activity results at the effector to target ratio of 1:1 are presented in Table 8. Results show that anti-GPC3-CAR T cells expressed a CAR ranging from about 40% to about 80%. Furthermore, the anti-GPC3-CAR T cells had specific killing of GPC3 positive Huh-3 and PLC/PRF/5 with a dose dependent effect on the effector-to-target ratio, whereas they did not have killing effect on GPC3 negative SK-HEP-1 (Table 8), indicating that anti-GPC3-CAR T cells prepared from the subjects in the present disclosure have excellent targeted killing effects.

 Example 4: Change of Lymphocytes after Lymphocyte Reduction After confirmation that no abnormality occurred during anti-GPC3-CAR T cell preparation from treated subjects, the subjects were subjected to a comprehensive assessment of various physical conditions to determine whether the subjects were suitable for in vivo lymphocyte reduction. A primary lymphocyte reduction protocol was designed for administration to suitable subjects. The following two lymphocyte reduction protocols were designed: Protocol 1: cyclophosphamide (CTX) single agent lymphocyte reduction protocol, at a dose of 1 g/m2/day×1 day. Protocol 2: combined fludarabine (FLU)+cyclophosphamide lymphocyte reduction protocol, at a dose of 20˜30 mg fludarabine/m2/day×4 days+500 mg cyclophosphamide/m2/day×2 days. The protocol was implemented with adjustment to include the following conditions: calculation of human surface area was conducted according to Stevenson's formula (Chinese Journal of Physiology, 12:327, 1937). That is, surface area (m2)=0.0061×height (cm)+0.0128×weight (kg)−0.1529. For example, an adult having a height of 170 cm and a weight of 60 kg has a surface area of 1.6521 m2. Subjects not suitable for lymphocyte reduction due to existing physical conditions or on their own volition were assigned to a second queue. Different lymphocyte reduction treatments were performed on a total of three subjects (H01, H02, and H03). One subject (H04) was not subjected to ablation due to physical conditions and their volition. Protocols are presented in Table 9.

 H01′ indicates an initial administration of anti-GPC3-CAR T cell therapy to subject H01; H012 indicates a second administration of anti-GPC3-CAR T cell therapy to subject H01; and D0 was defined as the day when anti-GPC3-CAR T cell administration was conducted. Following implementation of the aforementioned lymphocyte reduction protocols, various changes occurred in the absolute values of lymphocytes in the subjects. As a result of the lymphocyte reduction treatment of cyclophosphamide as a single agent, lymphocytes decreased by about 40% to about 72%. The combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphocyte reduction yielded a more significant difference in lymphocyte reduction, at about 82% to about 96.5%, as compared to the cyclophosphamide single agent administration Specifically, FIG. 2 demonstrates the change of the ratio of the absolute number of lymphocytes to the baseline at each monitored time point before and after lymphocyte reduction treatment administration. The aforementioned results demonstrate that the combination of fludarabine and cyclophosphamide results in superior lymphocyte reduction as compared to the cyclophosphamide single agent reduction protocol. Example 5: Clinical Response of Subjects Following Ablation About 2 days after the implementation of lymphocyte reduction, subjects were administered anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment by intravenous administration. The doses of the administered anti-GPC3-CAR T cells are presented in Table 7. The clinical responses of the subjects following the treatment are summarized in Table 10. The results demonstrate that the three subjects that underwent lymphocyte reduction have stable disease (SD) or partial disease (PR) following the anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment up to now. In contrast, the subject H04, that did not receive the lymphocyte reduction treatment, shows progressive disease by MRI 4 weeks following the anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment. As to AFP results, the subject H02 could not be assessed for prognosis from the tumor marker due to AFP insensitivity. For two other subjects, their AFP levels somewhat decreased, as in Table 10. It should be noted that the subject H03, after lymphocyte reduction using combined fludarabine and cyclophosphamide, showed an 87% reduction of AFP as compared to the baseline before the treatment. Meanwhile, imaging shows that the target site has partial clinical response. FIG. 3 shows MRI results from subject H03 before treatment vs. 10 weeks post-treatment.

Safety data and clinical observation showed that following treatment with anti-GPC3-CAR T cells, no subjects develop intolerable toxic or side effect. All subjects had some extent of fever and GRP increase. Subjects H01 and H04 had a shiver following administration. Subject H03 had decreased albumin caused by fever. By taking exogenous nutrient and albumin, the subject had normal albumin after the fever was gone (Table 11).

 Moreover, cytokine release syndrome, which often occurs during treatment of blood cancers using CAR T cells, was not observed in this clinical study, indicating that anti-GPC3-CAR T cells are safe. In sum, the results of the clinical studies using CAR-GPC T cells to treat GPC3 positive hepatocellular cancer demonstrate that subjects with effective lymphocyte reduction were conferred with certain clinical benefits by anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment, whereas the subjects without lymphocyte reduction therapy were not conferred any clinical benefit. Further, neither of the subjects with and without lymphocyte reduction exhibited intolerable toxic or side effect, with both of them having certain adverse responses such as fever and increased CRP, indicating that the lymphocyte reduction might not have worsened the adverse response of the subjects. Further, as regards to the effect of lymphocyte reduction therapy and benefit to the subjects, the combined fludarabine and cyclophosphamide lymphocyte reduction protocol may be superior to the cyclophosphamide single agent lymphocyte reduction protocol. In sum, anti-GPC3-CAR T cell treatment following implementation of effective lymphocyte reduction may provide an effective therapeutic solution to clinical treatment of GPC3 positive hepatocellular carcinoma. Example 6: Phenotypic Analysis Expression of cell surface molecules is determined by flow cytometry using standard methodology. The following monoclonal antibodies conjugated with phycoerythrin, fluorescein isothiocyanate, and/or peridinin chlorophyll protein are used: CD3, CD4, CD8, CD30, CCR4, CD45RA, CD45RO, CCR7, CD62L, CD56, αβT-cell receptor (BD Biosciences PharMingen). Expression of CAR by T cells is detected using an anti-CAR antibody. Samples are analyzed using a FACSCalibur (BD Biosciences PharMingen), and data is analyzed by CellQuest Pro software (BD Biosciences, San Jose, Calif.). At least 10,000 positive events are measured for each sample. Example 7: Cytotoxicity Assay: Liver Cancer To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effect of the second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells, a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was performed. Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 33-28BBZ, 92-28BBZ, and 4-28BBZ, were co-cultured with control cells, SK-HEP-1 (FIG. 4A) and CHO-K1 (FIG. 4B), at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. To evaluate anti-tumor cytotoxicity CAR-T cells, 33-28BBZ, 92-28BBZ, and 4-28BBZ, were co-cultured with GPC3-positive liver cancer cells, Huh-7, or control cells transduced to express GPC3, CHO-K1-GPC3+, at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C., FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B respectively. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. For all effector: target ratios, the cytotoxicity was obtained as the average value of 5 repetitive wells. Results Cytotoxicity data show that 33-28BBZ, 92-28BBZ, and 4-28BBZ CAR-T constructs had cytotoxicity against tumor cell lines expressing GPC3 while having no cytotoxicity to non-GPC3 expressing control lines at 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. Example 8: Cytotoxicity Assay: Liver Cancer Panel To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effect of the second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells, a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was performed. Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 92-28Z, 92-BBZ, 92-28BBZ, or mock were co-cultured with HepG2 (HCC)(FIG. 6A), Hep3B (HCC)(FIG. 6B), or PLC/PRF/5 (Hepatoma)(FIG. 6C) at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. To evaluate the cytotoxic effect of the second and third generation CAR-T a similar CytoTox 96® assay was performed using 92-28Z, 92-BBZ, 92-28BBZ, or mock co-cultured with high GPC3 expressing liver cancer cells, Huh-7, FIG. 7A. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. Results Cytotoxicity data show that both second and third generation constructs had comparable cytotoxicity across all liver cancer panels including HCC and hepatoma tumor cell lines at 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3. The second and third generation contruts were able to target tumor cells of varying levels of GPC3 expression, revealing a broad range of tumor targeting potential. Example 9: Cytotoxicity Assay: Gastric Carcinoma To evaluate the potential cytotoxic effect of the second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells in a gastric carcinoma tumor setting, a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) was performed. Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 92-28Z, 92-28BBZ, or mock were co-cultured with KATO-III at effector-to-target ratios of 1:3, 1:1, and 3:1 at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. Results Cytotoxicity data shows that both second and third generation constructs had comparable cytotoxicity against the gastric carcinoma tumor line, KATO-III, FIG. 7B, which mock transduced cells had no activity. Data suggests that CAR-T cells are specific to their tumor target and show no reacticity to tissues that does not express the GPC3 antigen. Example 10: Comparison of scFv 33 Versus scFv 92 To compare CAR-T with different scFv's to GPC3, second generation or third generation CAR-T transduced T cells were used in a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 33-28Z, 92-28Z, 92-BBZ, 92-28BBZ, or mock were co-cultured with Huh-7 cells or control cells, A431 (GPC3 neg), at effector: target ratio of 3:1, 1:1, or 1:3 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C.Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. Results Cytotoxicity data shows that constructs with the scFv 92 had increased cytotoxicy as compared to constructs with scFv 33 at 3:1, 1:1, and 1:3 effector to target ratios, FIG. 10B. Cytotoxicity was antigen specific as there was no cytotoxicity detected in the cocultured with the GPC3 neg tumor cell line A431, FIG. 10A. Example 11: Comparison of Second and Third Generation CAR-T To compare second and third generation CAR-T CAR-T transduced T cells were used in a CytoTox 96® Non-Radioactive Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega). Briefly, anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells, 4-28Z, 4-28BBZ, 4-4-28BBZ, 4-14-28BBZ, 4-20-28BBZ, 4-35-28BBZ, 4-42-28BBZ or mock-transduced were co-cultured with Huh7 (HCC) cells at effector: target ratio of 3:1, or 1:1 with target cells at 10,000/well, and incubated for 18 hours at 37° C. Visible wavelength absorbance data was collected using a standard 96-well plate reader post incubation. Results Cytotoxicity data show that both second and third generation constructs had cytotoxicity with 4-20-28BBZ, 4-35-28BBZ, and 4-42-28BBZ having higher cycotoxicity as measured by increased lysis, FIG. 9. Example 12: Proliferation Assay Proliferation of anti-GPC3 CAR-T after exposure to target cells (Huh-7, GPC3+) or control cells (SK-HEP-1, GPC3-) is determined by carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester dilution assays. One week post-transduction, control T lymphocytes and anti-GPC3 CAR-T cells are labeled with 1.5 μmol/L carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE; Invitrogen) and plated with irradiated tumor targets (GPC3 positive and GPC3 negative lines) at an effector-to-target (E: T) ratio of 5:1. CFSE dilution is measured on CD4+ and CD8+ T cells by flow cytometry on day 4 of co-culture. Example 13: Patient Derived Tumor Graft Murine Model and Lymphocyte Reduction NOD/SCID mice were each implanted with 2×2×2 mm lung cancer tumors. On approximately day 27 post implantation or when tumor size, reached 220 mm3, mice were administered cyclophosphamide intravenously and either 1×107 mock, hu92-28Z, or hu92-28BBZ CAR-T cells intraperitonealy. A second administration followed on day 34. Tumor volume was measured using caliper measurement approximately every 3-7 days until day 52 post tumor inoculation. Results On day 51 post tumor inoculation, mice treated with 92-28Z, second generation CAR-T, had significantly reduced tumor size as compared to mice treated with 92-28BBZ, third generation CAR-T, or saline, FIG. 8A and FIG. 8B. Mice treated with 92-28Z, second generation CAR-T, also had significantly reduced tumor weight as compared to mice treated with 92-28BBZ, third generation CAR-T, or saline, FIG. 8C. Mice treated with 92-28Z, second generation CAR-T, also had significantly reduced inhibition as compared to mice treated with 92-28BBZ, third generation CAR-T, or saline, FIG. 8D. Example 14: Xenograft HCC Murine Model 8- to 12-week old NOD.Cg-PrkdcscidIl2rgtmlWjl/SzJ (NSG) mice (Bar Harbor, Me.) were implanted with 0.5×106 Huh-7 tumor cells on their left flank. 7 days post tumor inoculation mice were treated with 1×107 mock-transduced T cells, hu92-28Z, or hu92-28BBZ by tail vein injection. Following treatment mice were monitored by caliper measurement at least once a week for 35 days post tumor cell inoculation. Results Treatment with hu92-28Z and hu92-28BBZ had significant anti-tumor activity as compared to mice treated with mock-transduced T cells. FIG. 11A shows that mice treated with hu92-28Z or hu92-28BBZ had significantly reduced tumor volume on day 35 post tumor cell inoculation. FIG. 11B shows that mice treated with hu92-28Z or hu92-28BBZ had significantly smaller tumors as evidenced by their reduced weight measurements as compared to mice treated with mock transduced cells. FIG. 11C shows images of the xenograft tumors. Example 15: Clinical Expansion of Anti-GPC3 CAR T Cells In order to generate a large number of transduced T cells, the cells are induced to proliferate using a rapid expansion protocol (REP). Prior to being used in REPs, T cells are started in culture with anti-CD3, anti-CD28 and IL-2 and transduced on the second day after the initiation of culture as detailed above. The cells are cultured in a 75 cm2 flask at 37° C. and 5% CO2. The cells are counted and suspended at a concentration of 0.5×106 cells/mL in fresh T cell medium with 300 IU/mL of IL-2 every two days for the remainder of the time they will be kept in culture. Example 16: Clinical Trial Patients with evaluable liver cancer undergo apheresis to isolate peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Lymphocytes are isolated, virally transduced with an anti-GPC3 CAR, expanded, and aliquots taken for immunologic testing. On days −7 and −6 before CAR-T administration, patients undergo a preparative regime of cyclophosphamide at 60 mg/kg/day×2 days IV over 1 hr. On days −7 and −3 before CAR-T administration, patients undergo a preparative regime of fludarabine 25 mg/m2/day IVPB daily over 30 minutes for 5 days. During the preparative regimen, patients undergo daily complete blood count (CBC) testing. In the first part of a phase I study a dose escalation is initiated utilizing one patient per group starting at 109 anti-GPC3 CAR-T per patient. Individual patients are treated at half log increments. Thus the following doses will be utilized: 109, 3×109 cells, 1010 cells, 3×1010 cells, and up to 1×1011 cells. Autologous anti-GPC3 CAR-T are administered intravenously over 20 to 30 minutes via non-filtered tubing. All patients return to the clinic for evaluation 6 weeks following administration of the CAR-T cell product.

","CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/583,818 filed Nov. 9, 2017, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by this reference. BACKGROUND The rates of obesity and overweight have increased drastically over recent decades, and the prevalence of obesity and overweight tends to increase with age. Obesity and overweight are correlated with numerous pathologies, including sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and general deterioration of patients' feelings of wellness. Overweight and obese patients can also suffer from multiple symptoms aside from the aforementioned pathologies, including fatigue, drowsiness, lack of motivation, anhedonia, and depression. Inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, have been shown to be exacerbated by excess weight, which may be an effect of increased adipocyte proliferation and the concomitant increased activity of adipose tissue specific cytokines known as adipokines. As such, ongoing research and study continue in efforts to find alternative solutions for fat accumulation and obesity SUMMARY The present disclosure relates generally to ketogenic diets and nutrient blends. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to methods and compositions directed to ketogenic diets and nutrient blends for minimizing fat accumulation in a growing animal without limiting caloric intake or preventing or treating obesity in an animal. Accordingly, in a general embodiment, a method of minimizing fat accumulation in a growing animal without limiting caloric intake or preventing or treating obesity in an animal can comprise orally administering a ketogenic diet and a nutrient blend to the animal. The nutrient blend can include at least four nutrients selected from the group consisting of walnut, maitake mushroom extract, EGCG, turmeric root powder, lycopene, taurine, EPA, and DHA to the animal.

Non-limiting examples of suitable preservatives include potassium sorbate, sorbic acid, sodium methyl para-hydroxybenzoate, calcium propionate, propionic acid, and combinations thereof. Specific amounts for each additional ingredient in the pet food compositions disclosed herein will depend on a variety of factors such as the ingredient included in the first edible material and any second edible material; the species of animal; the animal's age, body weight, general health, sex, and diet; the animal's consumption rate; the purpose for which the food product is administered to the animal; and the like. Therefore, the components and their amounts may vary widely. EXAMPLE By way of example and not limitation, the following non-limiting study is illustrative of compositions and methods using nutrient blends and ketogenic compositions and diets, in one or more embodiments provided by the present disclosure. Example 1—Weight Gain for Growing Animal Female nude mice with 3-4 weeks age (n=40) were randomized into 4 groups based on the baseline body weight (n=10/group, n=5/cage). After one-week transition from original diet to experimental diets, each group was assigned to one of the four diets randomly. The initial body weight was recorded and was followed up weekly for 14 weeks. All the diets and food are freely accessed to the mice. Every week fresh diet was weighted and provided three times to mice. The consumption of food was calculated by subtracting the residual food. The following four diets were used in the study. Control: AIN-93G (available from Research diets, Inc.) (18% protein, 7.2% fat, 63% carbohydrate, 5% fiber). Ketogenic diet (18% protein, 0% carbohydrate, 63% fat, 8.6% fiber). Ketogenic diet+nutrient blend (20.9% protein, 0% carbohydrate, 54.5% fat, 9.1% fiber). AIN-93G+nutrient blend (19.9% protein, 9.7% fat, 53.2% carbohydrate, 6.1% fiber). Nutrient blend (NB) composition: 11.3% whole walnut meal, 0.005% maitake mushroom extract, 0.05% EGCG, 3% turmeric root powder, 0.005% lycopene, 0.1% taurine, and 2% fish oil. Nutrient blend (NB) composition: 11.3% whole walnut meal, 0.005% maitake mushroom extract, 0.05% EGCG, 3% turmeric root powder, 0.005% lycopene, 0.1% taurine, and 2% fish oil. The results of the 14 weeks of feeding show that only the ketogenic diet with the nutrient blend slowed down the body weight gain without limiting caloric intake (Table 1), indicating that the mice grew at normal rate without accumulating excessive body fat. Since excessive body fat accumulation in young animals are correlated with higher risk of obesity in adult animals, the present blend can optimize growth and minimize the risk of obesity in growing animals and prevent obesity in adult animals.

Obesity and overweight are correlated with numerous pathologies, including sleep apnea, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, cancer, and general deterioration of patients' feelings of wellness. Overweight and obese patients can also suffer from multiple symptoms aside from the aforementioned pathologies, including fatigue, drowsiness, lack of motivation, anhedonia, and depression. Inflammatory diseases, such as arthritis, have been shown to be exacerbated by excess weight, which may be an effect of increased adipocyte proliferation and the concomitant increased activity of adipose tissue specific cytokines known as adipokines. As such, ongoing research and study continue in efforts to find alternative solutions for fat accumulation and obesity ",,"The present disclosure relates generally to ketogenic diets and nutrient blends. More specifically, the present disclosure relates to methods and compositions directed to ketogenic diets and nutrient blends for minimizing fat accumulation in a growing animal without limiting caloric intake or preventing or treating obesity in an animal.

Therefore, the components and their amounts may vary widely. EXAMPLE By way of example and not limitation, the following non-limiting study is illustrative of compositions and methods using nutrient blends and ketogenic compositions and diets, in one or more embodiments provided by the present disclosure. Example 1—Weight Gain for Growing Animal Female nude mice with 3-4 weeks age (n=40) were randomized into 4 groups based on the baseline body weight (n=10/group, n=5/cage). After one-week transition from original diet to experimental diets, each group was assigned to one of the four diets randomly. The initial body weight was recorded and was followed up weekly for 14 weeks. All the diets and food are freely accessed to the mice. Every week fresh diet was weighted and provided three times to mice. The consumption of food was calculated by subtracting the residual food. The following four diets were used in the study. Control: AIN-93G (available from Research diets, Inc.) (18% protein, 7.2% fat, 63% carbohydrate, 5% fiber). Ketogenic diet (18% protein, 0% carbohydrate, 63% fat, 8.6% fiber). Ketogenic diet+nutrient blend (20.9% protein, 0% carbohydrate, 54.5% fat, 9.1% fiber). AIN-93G+nutrient blend (19.9% protein, 9.7% fat, 53.2% carbohydrate, 6.1% fiber). Nutrient blend (NB) composition: 11.3% whole walnut meal, 0.005% maitake mushroom extract, 0.05% EGCG, 3% turmeric root powder, 0.005% lycopene, 0.1% taurine, and 2% fish oil. Nutrient blend (NB) composition: 11.3% whole walnut meal, 0.005% maitake mushroom extract, 0.05% EGCG, 3% turmeric root powder, 0.005% lycopene, 0.1% taurine, and 2% fish oil. The results of the 14 weeks of feeding show that only the ketogenic diet with the nutrient blend slowed down the body weight gain without limiting caloric intake (Table 1), indicating that the mice grew at normal rate without accumulating excessive body fat. Since excessive body fat accumulation in young animals are correlated with higher risk of obesity in adult animals, the present blend can optimize growth and minimize the risk of obesity in growing animals and prevent obesity in adult animals.

","Subject of the present invention is the in vitro diagnosis, prognosis and risk stratification of a patient having a primary, non-infectious disease, whereby the level of Procalcitonin (PCT) in a sample of a body fluid of the patient is indicative for the risk of the patient to contract a further disease or medical condition. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Procalcitonin (PCT) has become a well-established biomarker for sepsis diagnosis: PCT reflects the severity of bacterial infection and is in particular used to monitor progression of infection into sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. PCT concentrations in sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock are typically above 1 ng/mL. It is possible to use PCT to measure the activity of the infection-associated systemic inflammatory response, to control success of therapy, and to estimate prognosis (Assicot M et al.: High serum procalcitonin concentrations in patients with sepsis and infection. Lancet 1993, 341:515-8; Clec'h C et al.: Diagnostic and prognostic value of procalcitonin in patients with septic shock. Crit Care Med 2004; 32:1166-9; Lee Y J et al.: Predictive comparisons of procalcitonin (PCT) level, arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR), APACHE III score and multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS) in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), Yonsei Med J 2004, 45, 29-37; Meisner M.: Biomarkers of sepsis: clinically useful? Curr Opin Crit Care 2005, 11, 473-480; Wunder C et al.: Are IL-6, IL-10 and PCT plasma concentrations reliable for outcome prediction in severe sepsis? A comparison with APACHE III and SAPS II. Inflamm Res 2004, 53, 158-163). The increase of PCT levels in patients with sepsis correlates with mortality (Oberhoffer M et al.: Outcome prediction by traditional and new biomarkers of inflammation in patients with sepsis. Clin Chem Lab Med 1999; 37:363-368). An increasing number of studies discusses the potential role of PCT in non-septic infectious diseases like pneumonia, bacterial meningitis and malaria (Bugden S A et al.: The potential role of procalcitonin in the emergency department management of febrile young adults during a sustained meningococcal epidemic. Emerg Med Australas 2004, 16, 114-119; Chiwakata C B et al.: Procalcitonin as a parameter of disease severity and risk of mortality in patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. J Infect Dis 2001, 183, 1161-1164; Schwarz S et al.: Serum procalcitonin levels in bacterial and abacterial meningitis, Crit Care Med 2000, 28, 1828-1832). In vitro-studies showed that PCT plays an important role during monocyte adhesion and migration and further has an effect on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression (Linscheid P et al.: Expression and secretion of procalcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide by adherent monocytes and by macrophage-activated adipocytes, Crit Care Med 2004, 32, 1715-1721; Wiedermann F J et al.: Migration of human monocytes in response to procalcitonin, Crit Care Med, 2002, 30, 1112-1117; Hoffmann G et al.: Procalcitonin amplifies inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression and nitric oxide production in vascular smooth muscle cells, Crit Care Med, 2002, 30, 2091-2095.). PCT has been used to guide antibiotic therapy (Christ-Crain M et al.: Effect of procalcitonin-guided treatment on antibiotic use and outcome in lower respiratory tract infections: cluster-randomised, single-blinded intervention trial, Lancet. 2004 Feb. 21; 363(9409):600-7.): In patients with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections presenting at the emergency department PCT was measured, and only patients with PCT concentrations >0.25 ng/mL or >0.5 ng/mL were treated with antibiotics. Apparently, this regimen led to a clinical outcome undistinguishable from the control group, in which also many patients with PCT concentrations <0.25 ng/mL received antibiotics. Of note, in this study, patients with relevant comorbidities as for instance heart failure were excluded. Thus, it is unclear so far, whether the presence of a primary disease in addition to an infection should influence the interpretation of PCT concentrations below 0.25 ng/mL. A relevant primary disease might put an additional burden on the immune system, and biomarkers of infection, such as PCT, in such situation might be indicative of an infection in a different, i.e. lower, concentration range than in the absence of a relevant primary disease. In healthy individuals, the PCT concentration is well below 0.25 ng/mL: The median concentration has been determined to be 0.014 ng/mL (Morgenthaler N G et al.: Sensitive immunoluminometric assay for the detection of procalcitonin. Clin Chem. 2002 May; 48(5):788-90.) A method for diagnosis of infections or inflammatory diseases of the airways and lungs with associated heart failure, wherein the biomarker procalcitonin is determined in a patient, is described in WO 2008/040328 A2. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The present invention is based on the surprising finding that in samples of patients with a primary, non-infectious disease, slightly elevated procalcitonin (PCT) levels (concentrations) have been detected at a large frequency and are of diagnostic relevance. Remarkably, the inventors have identified a large number of samples having serum levels above 0.03 ng/mL (26.0%) and 0.05 ng/mL (14.7%), respectively, from a total of 4997 samples of patients having a primary, non-infectious disease. Slightly elevated PCT levels relate to PCT levels in the range of from about 0.02 to 0.25 ng/mL, preferably between about 0.02 and 0.1 ng/mL. The presence of slightly elevated PCT levels may be indicative for the risk of a patient having a non-infectious primary disease to acquire a yet clinically unmanifested and/or yet asymptomatic further disease or medical condition. Such a further disease or medical condition may be related to a local infection or the local infection may facilitate, accelerate and/or enhance the risk of contracting or acquiring the further disease or medical condition. The present invention provides a method for the prognosis of a patient's risk to acquire a further disease or medical condition in addition to an non-infectious primary disease. This also allows for adaption of the treatment of these patients, e.g. by an additional antibiotics therapy which the patient would not have necessarily received if the elevated PCT level had not been detected. It has to be noted that so far, patients with non-infectious primary diseases are not routinely screened for their PCT levels during diagnosis. It is taught by the present invention that patients with a primary disease not being an infection should be assayed for their PCT level to allow for the prognosis of the risk to acquire a further disease or medical condition and ultimately to allow for the adaption of therapy. Hence, the present invention provides an in vitro method for prognosis for a patient having a primary disease not being an infection, the method comprising: determining the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, preferably more than 50 amino acids in length, more preferably more than 110 amino acids in length, in a sample obtained from said patient; and correlating said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof to a risk of the patient to contract a further disease or medical condition which has not yet been manifested and/or is not yet symptomatic.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an in vitro method for prognosis for a patient having a primary disease not being an infection, the method comprising: determining the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, preferably more than 50 amino acids in length, more preferably more than 110 amino acids in length, in a sample obtained from said patient; and correlating said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof to a risk of the patient to contract a further disease or medical condition which has not yet been manifested and/or is not yet symptomatic. “Patients” in the meaning of the invention are understood to be all persons or animals, irrespective whether or not they exhibit pathological changes, unless stated otherwise. In a preferred embodiment the patient according to the invention is a human. Preferably, the patient in the context of the present invention has a primary disease not being an infection and the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, in serum or plasma samples of said patient is below 0.25 ng/mL. In the present invention, the term “prognosis” denotes a prediction of how a subject's (e.g. a patient's) medical condition will progress. This may include an estimation of the chance of recovery or the chance of an adverse outcome for said subject. As mentioned herein in the context of proteins or peptides, the term “fragment” refers to smaller proteins or peptides derivable from larger proteins or peptides, which hence comprise a partial sequence of the larger protein or peptide. Said fragments are derivable from the larger proteins or peptides by saponification of one or more of its peptide bonds. Procalcitonin is a 116 amino acids comprising peptide. Smaller variants, such as for instance PCT 3-116 and others, exist as well. Thus the length of procalcitonin fragments is at least 12 amino acids, preferably more than 50 amino acids, more preferably more than 110 amino acids. Preferably herein, said risk of contracting a further disease or medical condition is related to an existing bacterial infection, particularly a local infection. A local infection may facilitate, accelerate and/or enhance the risk of contracting or acquiring a further disease or medical condition in a patient having a non-infectious primary disease. In particularly preferred embodiments of the in vitro method, said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof is indicative for a bacterial infection in the patient. It is further preferred that said infection is a local infection. A local infection herein relates to all infections being less severe than a sepsis. A sepsis is defined as an infection being associated with the “Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome” (“SIRS”) (Levy M M et al. 2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference. Crit Care Med. 2003 April; 31(4):1250-6). The local infection may for example be an infection in the oral cavity, at the teeth or the root of the teeth, infection in wounds, infection in the respiratory tract, or haemorrhoids, or others. Said local infection herein may be treated by administration of an antibiotic. Treatment of the local infection leads to a decreased risk of the patient for acquiring the further disease or medical condition. Hence, in a preferred embodiment of the in vitro method, said bacterial infection is treatable with an antibiotic. In this case it is preferred, that the risk of contracting a further disease or medical condition decreases when the patient is treated with an antibiotic. The correlating step of the in vitro method of the present invention preferably comprises comparing said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof to a threshold level, whereby, when said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof exceeds said threshold level, said patient is predisposed to said risk. Said threshold level is preferably between 0.02 and 0.25 ng/mL, more preferably between 0.02 and 0.1 ng/mL, even more preferably at about 0.05 (+/−0.01) ng/mL, and most preferably at about 0.03 (+/−0.01) ng/mL. Definition of these threshold levels comes from the analysis of the frequency distribution of PCT level ranges shown in the histogram of appended FIG. 1 and Example 1. In a particular embodiment said primary disease is not arteriosclerosis. In another embodiment said primary disease is not heart failure. It is in some embodiments of the invention said primary disease is not an acute coronary syndrome. Furthermore, it is in a particular embodiment preferred that said primary disease is not a coronary disease. In a particular embodiment the further disease or medical condition is not selected from the group comprising acute coronary syndrome, heart failure or myocardial infarction. In one embodiment said further disease or medical condition is not an infection, particularly not an infection of the airways and lungs. In another embodiment of the in vitro method according to the invention, said primary disease is selected from but not restricted to the group comprising cancer, diabetes, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, chronic renal diseases, hypertension, orthopaedic diseases including osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, in another embodiment said further disease or medical condition is selected from the group comprising cardiological diseases selected from but not restricted to the group comprising atherosclerosis, acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. The primary disease herein relates to a disease which is already manifested and/or is already symptomatic. The further disease or medical condition relates to a disease which is not yet manifested and/or is not yet symptomatic. The sample from the patient may for example be selected from the group comprising a blood sample, a serum sample, a plasma sample, and an urine sample or an extract of any of the aforementioned samples. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the in vitro method further comprises mathematically combining said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof with the level of one or more additional prognostic biomarkers, whereby the combination of said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof with said level of additional prognostic biomarker(s) increases the predictive value of said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof or the level of said related biomarker for said risk of contracting a further disease or medical condition. In the context of the present invention, an “algorithm” or “mathematical algorithm” refers to the use of a mathematical or statistical method or model used to compare a certain measured value with values of a reference population in order to stratify said measured value. This may for instance be the median of the level of a certain entity in an ensemble of pre-determined samples, which means that the measured level of said entity is compared with the mathematical median of the level of said entity in a given number of samples. The number of samples used to determine the median is not particularly limited, but should be sufficient in order to ensure statistical significance of the median. The number of samples used to determine the median may even increase over the course of time, as the results of further measurement values from clinical samples are added in order to increase the statistic significance of the median. Preferably, the sample number is chosen such that statistical significance of the median is ensured. Thus, said median is used as a reference value, whereby the measured level of the aforementioned entity can be statistically correlated with a certain physiological state, e.g. the propensity of an adverse outcome for a patient, depending on the relative level above or below the median and the extent of deviation of the measured value from said median. In place of the median, other statistical methods, such as the determination of quantiles (e.g. quartiles or percentiles) or mathematical models, preferably Cox Regression may be used analogously to the above description in order to obtain the above-mentioned reference value and/or otherwise determine the significance of a measured value with respect to the physiological status of a given subject from which the sample has been obtained. Said mathematical or statistical methods or models are well known to the person skilled in the art and the use thereof in the context of medicinal applications is well established. The “term” biomarker (biological marker) relates to measurable and quantifiable biological parameters (e.g., specific enzyme concentration, specific hormone concentration, specific gene phenotype distribution in a population, presence of biological substances) which serve as indices for health- and physiology-related assessments, such as disease risk, psychiatric disorders, environmental exposure and its effects, disease diagnosis, metabolic processes, substance abuse, pregnancy, cell line development, epidemiologic studies, etc. Furthermore, a biomarker is defined as a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. A biomarker may be measured on a biosample (as a blood, urine, or tissue test), it may be a recording obtained from a person (blood pressure, ECO, or Holter), or it may be an imaging test (echocardiogram or CT scan) (Vasan et al. 2006, Circulation 113:2335-2362). Biomarkers can indicate a variety of health or disease characteristics, including the level or type of exposure to an environmental factor, genetic susceptibility, genetic responses to exposures, biomarkers of subclinical or clinical disease, or indicators of response to therapy. Thus, a simplistic way to think of biomarkers is as indicators of disease trait (risk factor or risk biomarker), disease state (preclinical or clinical), or disease rate (progression). Accordingly, biomarkers can be classified as antecedent biomarkers (identifying the risk of developing an illness), screening biomarkers (screening for subclinical disease), diagnostic biomarkers (recognizing overt disease), staging biomarkers (categorizing disease severity), or prognostic biomarkers (predicting future disease course, including recurrence and response to therapy, and monitoring efficacy of therapy). Biomarkers may also serve as surrogate end points. A surrogate end point is one that can be used as an outcome in clinical trials to evaluate safety and effectiveness of therapies in lieu of measurement of the true outcome of interest. The underlying principle is that alterations in the surrogate end point track closely with changes in the outcome of interest. Surrogate end points have the advantage that they may be gathered in a shorter time frame and with less expense than end points such as morbidity and mortality, which require large clinical trials for evaluation. Additional values of surrogate end points include the fact that they are closer to the exposure/intervention of interest and may be easier to relate causally than more distant clinical events. An important disadvantage of surrogate end points is that if clinical outcome of interest is influenced by numerous factors (in addition to the surrogate end point), residual confounding may reduce the validity of the surrogate end point. It has been suggested that the validity of a surrogate end point is greater if it can explain at least 50% of the effect of an exposure or intervention on the outcome of interest. For instance, a biomarker may be a protein, peptide or a nucleic acid molecule. One of said prognostic biomarker(s) is preferably proBNP or fragments thereof in a sample obtained from said patient. More preferably, said fragment of proBNP is NT pro-BNP or BNP. In a particular embodiment, the in vitro method further comprises determining the level of one or more additional prognostic biomarkers in a sample obtained from said patient, and correlating both said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof and said level of one or more additional prognostic biomarkers to said predisposition to a risk, whereby the combination of said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof with said level of one or more additional prognostic biomarkers increases the predictive value of said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof for said risk. The additional prognostic biomarker may for example be selected from a group comprising troponin, myeloperoxidase, CRP, neopterin, GDF-15, ST2, cystatin-C, as well as the following peptides in form of their mature peptides, prohormones (precursors) and associated prohormone fragments: natriuretic peptides, adrenomedullin, endothelins, vasopressin. Preferably, the correlation between said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof and said level of one or more additional prognostic biomarkers is conducted with a mathematical algorithm. In a further aspect the present invention relates to the use of an ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay having a lower limit of detection of below about 0.05 ng/mL, preferably below about 0.04 ng/mL, more preferably below about 0.03 ng/mL, most preferably below about 0.02 ng/mL for determining in a patient having a primary disease not being an infection the risk of the patient to contract a further disease or medical condition which has not yet been manifested and/or is not yet symptomatic. In a preferred embodiment of the use of the ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay, the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length or a mixture of procalicitonin and/or fragments thereof, is determined in a sample from said patient. In one embodiment the level of only one fragment is determined. In another embodiment the level of a mixture of procalicitonin and/or fragments thereof is determined. As mentioned herein, an “assay” or “diagnostic assay” can be of any type applied in the field of diagnostics, including but not restricted to assays methods based on enzymatic reactions, luminescence, fluorescence or radiochemicals. The preferred detection methods comprise rapid tests (point-of-care tests), radioimmunoassays, chemiluminescence- and fluorescence-immunoassays, Immunoblot assays, Enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA), Luminex-based bead arrays, and protein microarray assays. The assay types can further be microtitre plate-based, chip-based, bead-based, wherein the biomarkers can be attached to the surface or in solution. The assays can be homogenous or heterogeneous assays, sandwich assays, competitive and non-competitive assays. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the assay is in the form of a sandwich assay, which is a noncompetitive immunoassay, wherein the molecule to be detected and/or quantified is bound to a first antibody and to a second antibody. The first antibody may be bound to a solid phase, e.g. a bead, a surface of a well or other container, a chip or a strip, and the second antibody is an antibody which is labeled, e.g. with a dye, with a radioisotope, or a reactive or catalytically active moiety. The amount of labeled antibody on the site is then measured by an appropriate method. The general composition and procedures involved with “sandwich assays” are well-established and known to the skilled person (The Immunoassay Handbook, Ed. David Wild, Elsevier LTD, Oxford; 3rd ed. (May 2005), ISBN-13: 978-0080445267; Hultschig C et al., Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2006 February; 10(1):4-10. PMID: 16376134), incorporated herein by reference. In a particularly preferred embodiment the assay comprises two capture molecules (capture probes), preferably antibodies which are both present as dispersions in a liquid reaction mixture, wherein a first marking component is attached to the first capture molecule, wherein said first marking component is part of a marking system based on fluorescence- or chemiluminescence-quenching or amplification, and a second marking component of said marking system is attached to the second capture molecule, so that upon binding of both capture molecules to the analyte to be detected, a measurable signal is generated that allows for the detection of the formed sandwich complexes in the solution comprising the sample. In the context of the present invention, a capture probe may be selected from the group comprising a nucleic acid molecule, particularly an aptamer, a carbohydrate molecule, a PNA molecule, a protein, an antibody, a peptide, particularly a cyclic peptide or a glycoprotein. Even more preferred, said marking system comprises rare earth cryptates or rare earth chelates in combination with a fluorescence dye or chemiluminescence dye, in particular a dye of the cyanine type. In the context of the present invention, fluorescence based assays comprise the use of dyes, which may for instance be selected from the group comprising FAM (5- or 6-carboxyfluorescein), VIC, NED, Fluorescein, Fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC), IRD-700/800, Cyanine dyes, such as CY3, CY5, CY3.5, CY5.5, Cy7, Xanthen, 6-Carboxy-2′,4′,7′,4,7-hexachlorofluorescein (HEX), TET, 6-Carboxy-4′,5′-dichloro-2′,7′-dimethodyfluorescein (JOE), N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA), 6-Carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX), 5-Carboxyrhodamine-6G (R6G5), 6-carboxyrhodamine-6G (RG6), Rhodamine, Rhodamine Green, Rhodamine Red, Rhodamine 110, BODIPY dyes, such as BODIPY TMR, Oregon Green, Coumarines such as Umbelliferone, Benzimides, such as Hoechst 33258; Phenanthridines, such as Texas Red, Yakima Yellow, Alexa Fluor, PET, Ethidiumbromide, Acridinium dyes, Carbazol dyes, Phenoxazine dyes, Porphyrine dyes, Polymethin dyes, and the like. In the context of the present invention, chemiluminescence based assays comprise the use of dyes, based on the physical principles described for chemiluminescent materials in Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of chemical technology, 4th ed., executive editor, J. I. Kroschwitz; editor, M. Howe-Grant, John Wiley & Sons, 1993, vol. 15, p. 518-562, incorporated herein by reference, including citations on pages 551-562. Preferred chemiluminescent dyes are acridinium esters. In the context of the present invention, the term “ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay” means that the assay for the detection of procalcitonin or fragments thereof and/or quantification of the level thereof has a lower limit of detection of below about 0.05 ng/mL, preferably below about 0.04 ng/mL, more preferably below about 0.03 ng/mL, most preferably below about 0.02 ng/mL. An ultrasensitive PCT assay is for example the PCT sensitive LIA (Luminescence Immuno Assay) Kit (B.R.A.H.M.S AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany, Product No. 109.050). PCT levels in the context of the present invention may for example be determined with an assay as described above, preferably with the PCT sensitive LIA (Luminescence Immuno Assay) Kit (B.R.A.H.M.S AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany, Product No. 109.050) as in example 1 or following the general procedure described in example 2. The use of an ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay is preferably for stratifying the risk for contracting a further disease or medical in a patient having a primary disease. The ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay may be used for the control of the treatment or prevention of said further disease or medical condition. Preferably said treatment or prevention comprises administration of an antibiotic to the patient. The ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay may for example be a sandwich assay comprising two antibodies against different moieties of procalcitonin. In a particular embodiment of the use of the ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay, one antibody is against the calcitonin moiety of procalcitonin, and the other antibody is a monoclonal antibody against the katacalcin moiety of procalcitonin. In the context of the present invention, the term “calcitonin moiety of procalcitonin” refers to a polypeptide comprising the amino acids 85-116 of pre-procalcitonin. In the context of the present invention, the “katacalcin moiety of procalcitonin” refers to a polypeptide comprising the amino acids 121-141 of pre-procalcitonin. The above amino acid numbers refer to the sequence of human pre-procalcitonin as listed in Protein data bank entry http://www.expasy.ch/uniprot/P01258. Also encompassed are amino acid sequences of analogous origin analogous in other species, as well as polypeptides with preferably, at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, most preferably at least 98% sequence homology to the above-mentioned human polypeptides. In yet another aspect the present invention relates to an antibiotic for the use in the treatment of a local infection for the prevention of a further disease or medical condition which has not yet been manifested in a patient having a primary disease, wherein said primary disease is not an infection and wherein the antibiotic is administered when the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, in a sample of the patient selected from the group comprising a blood sample, a serum sample and a plasma sample, is between 0.02 and 0.25 ng/mL, preferably between 0.02 and 0.1 ng/mL. Preferably, the risk of contracting a further disease or medical condition decreases when the said patient is treated with an antibiotic. In a further aspect the invention relates to an in vitro method for diagnosis of the presence of a bacterial infection in a patient, the method comprising: determining the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, in a sample obtained from said patient: (i) at least once before the start of said antibiotic treatment or within six hours after the start of the treatment, and (ii) at least once after 12 hours to 1 week after the start of an antibiotic treatment of the patient; and correlating said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof to the presence of a bacterial infection, wherein a decrease of said level of at least 20% per 24 h ng/mL is indicative for the presence of a bacterial infection in the patient. Preferably, the patient has a primary disease not being an infection and the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, in serum or plasma samples of said patient is below 0.25 ng/mL. The term “antibiotic” in the context of the present invention refers to a chemical substance, which has the capacity to inhibit the growth of or to kill microorganisms. Different antibiotics may have various mechanism of action, e.g. by binding to bacterial ribosomal subunits, thereby inhibiting protein biosynthesis, inhibiting cell wall synthesis, e.g. by inhibiting peptidoglycan synthesis, interacting with the bacterial cytoplasmic membrane, thereby e.g. changing its permeability, inhibit bacterial DNA gyrase or topoisomerase IV enzyme, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription, inhibiting folate synthesis, or inhibiting transcription by binding to RNA polymerase. The antibiotic in the context of the present invention may for example be selected from the group comprising β-Lactames, glykopeptides, polyketides, aminoglycoside antibiotics, polypeptide antibiotics, chinolones and sulfonamides. Preferably, the term refers to beta-lactam compounds like penicillines, cephalosporins or carbapenems; tetracyclines; macrolides; fluoroquinolones; sulphonamides; aminoglycosides; imidazoles; peptide-antibiotics and lincosamides. More preferably, the term relates to amoxicillin, flucloxacillin, penicillin G, ampicillin, methicillin, oxacillin, cefoxitin, ceftriaxone, ceftrizoxime, imipenem, erythromacin, tylosin, tilmicosin, spiramycin, josamycin, azithromycin, clarithromycin, tetracycline, minocycline, doxycycline, lymecycline, norfloxacin, enoxacin, ofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim, gentamicin, amikacin, metronidazole, bactiracin, clindamycin or lincomycin. Most preferably, the term relates to ampicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, gentamicin, metronidazole, bacitracin or clindomycin. EXAMPLES Example 1: Determination of Procalcitonin Levels in Samples of Patients with Various Primary Diseases 4997 consecutive blood sera samples of patients of a clinical lab have been analyzed to determine the level of procalcitonin (PCT) using the B R.A.H.M.S PCT sensitive LIA (Luminescence Immuno Assay) Kit (B.R.A.H.M.S AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany, Product No. 109.050). The patients sera have been sent for analysis to the lab by different consulting specialist physicians from various medical fields, such as nephrology, urology, oncology, pediatrics, internal medicine, general medicine and others. The assay has been performed according to the manual shipped with the kit, except that the sample volume has been increased form 50 μL to 100 μL to increase the functional assay sensitivity (FAS) and to reliably determine the PCT concentrations in the lower concentration range (0.05 to 0.25 ng/mL). The frequencies of the determined PCT levels have been plotted in a histogram (see appended FIG. 1). 66.7% of the sera samples showed PCT levels above 0.017 ng/mL, 26.0% of the sera samples showed PCT concentrations of above 0.03 ng/mL and 14.0% of the sera samples showed PCT levels of above 0.05 ng/mL. The samples having PCT concentrations above 0.05 ng/mL (i.e. 702 samples out of 4997 samples) have been classified according to the medical field of the consulting specialist physician from which the respective sample originated. This correlation is plotted in appended FIG. 2. The high number of patients having a primary disease not being an infection but nevertheless having PCT levels above 0.03 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively, is a surprising finding. Example 2: General Procedure for the Determination of Procalcitonin Levels in Samples of Patients Procalcitonin (PCT) can be measured as described (Morgenthaler N G et al.: Clin Chem, 2002 May, 48(5), 788-790). Sheep antibodies were raised against the calcitonin moiety of PCT, and a mouse monoclonal antibody was raised against the katacalcin moiety of PCT. Tubes were coated with the anti-katacalcin antibody. The anti-Calcitonin antibody was labelled with MACN Acridiniumester (InVent GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany) and served as tracer. Dilutions of recombinant PCT in normal horse serum served as standards. 100 μl sample or standard were incubated in the coated tubes for 30 minutes, 200 μl tracer were added. After incubation for 2 h the tubes were washed 4 times with 1 ml of LIA wash solution (B.R.A.H.M.S AG), and bound. Chemiluminescence was measured using a LB952T luminometer (Berthold, Germany). ","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows a histogram plot of the frequency of procalcitonin level ranges in patients' samples. These were 4997 unselected samples consecutively sent by physicians of various specialties to a private laboratory for various types of analysis, but not PCT. FIG. 2 shows the distribution of PCT levels above 0.05 ng/mL in relation the medical field of the consulting specialist physician who provided the respective sample. Medians in all groups are indicated. ","['US20190224135A1-20190725-D00001.TIF', 'US20190224135A1-20190725-D00002.TIF']","Procalcitonin (PCT) has become a well-established biomarker for sepsis diagnosis: PCT reflects the severity of bacterial infection and is in particular used to monitor progression of infection into sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock. PCT concentrations in sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock are typically above 1 ng/mL. It is possible to use PCT to measure the activity of the infection-associated systemic inflammatory response, to control success of therapy, and to estimate prognosis (Assicot M et al.: High serum procalcitonin concentrations in patients with sepsis and infection. Lancet 1993, 341:515-8; Clec'h C et al.: Diagnostic and prognostic value of procalcitonin in patients with septic shock. Crit Care Med 2004; 32:1166-9; Lee Y J et al.: Predictive comparisons of procalcitonin (PCT) level, arterial ketone body ratio (AKBR), APACHE III score and multiple organ dysfunction score (MODS) in systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), Yonsei Med J 2004, 45, 29-37; Meisner M.: Biomarkers of sepsis: clinically useful? Curr Opin Crit Care 2005, 11, 473-480; Wunder C et al.: Are IL-6, IL-10 and PCT plasma concentrations reliable for outcome prediction in severe sepsis? A comparison with APACHE III and SAPS II. Inflamm Res 2004, 53, 158-163). The increase of PCT levels in patients with sepsis correlates with mortality (Oberhoffer M et al.: Outcome prediction by traditional and new biomarkers of inflammation in patients with sepsis. Clin Chem Lab Med 1999; 37:363-368). An increasing number of studies discusses the potential role of PCT in non-septic infectious diseases like pneumonia, bacterial meningitis and malaria (Bugden S A et al.: The potential role of procalcitonin in the emergency department management of febrile young adults during a sustained meningococcal epidemic. Emerg Med Australas 2004, 16, 114-119; Chiwakata C B et al.: Procalcitonin as a parameter of disease severity and risk of mortality in patients with Plasmodium falciparum malaria. J Infect Dis 2001, 183, 1161-1164; Schwarz S et al.: Serum procalcitonin levels in bacterial and abacterial meningitis, Crit Care Med 2000, 28, 1828-1832). In vitro-studies showed that PCT plays an important role during monocyte adhesion and migration and further has an effect on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) gene expression (Linscheid P et al.: Expression and secretion of procalcitonin and calcitonin gene-related peptide by adherent monocytes and by macrophage-activated adipocytes, Crit Care Med 2004, 32, 1715-1721; Wiedermann F J et al.: Migration of human monocytes in response to procalcitonin, Crit Care Med, 2002, 30, 1112-1117; Hoffmann G et al.: Procalcitonin amplifies inducible nitric oxide synthase gene expression and nitric oxide production in vascular smooth muscle cells, Crit Care Med, 2002, 30, 2091-2095.). PCT has been used to guide antibiotic therapy (Christ-Crain M et al.: Effect of procalcitonin-guided treatment on antibiotic use and outcome in lower respiratory tract infections: cluster-randomised, single-blinded intervention trial, Lancet. 2004 Feb. 21; 363(9409):600-7.): In patients with symptoms of lower respiratory tract infections presenting at the emergency department PCT was measured, and only patients with PCT concentrations >0.25 ng/mL or >0.5 ng/mL were treated with antibiotics. Apparently, this regimen led to a clinical outcome undistinguishable from the control group, in which also many patients with PCT concentrations <0.25 ng/mL received antibiotics. Of note, in this study, patients with relevant comorbidities as for instance heart failure were excluded. Thus, it is unclear so far, whether the presence of a primary disease in addition to an infection should influence the interpretation of PCT concentrations below 0.25 ng/mL. A relevant primary disease might put an additional burden on the immune system, and biomarkers of infection, such as PCT, in such situation might be indicative of an infection in a different, i.e. lower, concentration range than in the absence of a relevant primary disease. In healthy individuals, the PCT concentration is well below 0.25 ng/mL: The median concentration has been determined to be 0.014 ng/mL (Morgenthaler N G et al.: Sensitive immunoluminometric assay for the detection of procalcitonin. Clin Chem. 2002 May; 48(5):788-90.) A method for diagnosis of infections or inflammatory diseases of the airways and lungs with associated heart failure, wherein the biomarker procalcitonin is determined in a patient, is described in WO 2008/040328 A2. ",,"The present invention is based on the surprising finding that in samples of patients with a primary, non-infectious disease, slightly elevated procalcitonin (PCT) levels (concentrations) have been detected at a large frequency and are of diagnostic relevance. Remarkably, the inventors have identified a large number of samples having serum levels above 0.03 ng/mL (26.0%) and 0.05 ng/mL (14.7%), respectively, from a total of 4997 samples of patients having a primary, non-infectious disease. Slightly elevated PCT levels relate to PCT levels in the range of from about 0.02 to 0.25 ng/mL, preferably between about 0.02 and 0.1 ng/mL. The presence of slightly elevated PCT levels may be indicative for the risk of a patient having a non-infectious primary disease to acquire a yet clinically unmanifested and/or yet asymptomatic further disease or medical condition. Such a further disease or medical condition may be related to a local infection or the local infection may facilitate, accelerate and/or enhance the risk of contracting or acquiring the further disease or medical condition. The present invention provides a method for the prognosis of a patient's risk to acquire a further disease or medical condition in addition to an non-infectious primary disease. This also allows for adaption of the treatment of these patients, e.g. by an additional antibiotics therapy which the patient would not have necessarily received if the elevated PCT level had not been detected. It has to be noted that so far, patients with non-infectious primary diseases are not routinely screened for their PCT levels during diagnosis. It is taught by the present invention that patients with a primary disease not being an infection should be assayed for their PCT level to allow for the prognosis of the risk to acquire a further disease or medical condition and ultimately to allow for the adaption of therapy. Hence, the present invention provides an in vitro method for prognosis for a patient having a primary disease not being an infection, the method comprising: determining the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, preferably more than 50 amino acids in length, more preferably more than 110 amino acids in length, in a sample obtained from said patient; and correlating said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof to a risk of the patient to contract a further disease or medical condition which has not yet been manifested and/or is not yet symptomatic. 
BRIEF ","The present invention relates to an in vitro method for prognosis for a patient having a primary disease not being an infection, the method comprising: determining the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, preferably more than 50 amino acids in length, more preferably more than 110 amino acids in length, in a sample obtained from said patient; and correlating said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof to a risk of the patient to contract a further disease or medical condition which has not yet been manifested and/or is not yet symptomatic. “Patients” in the meaning of the invention are understood to be all persons or animals, irrespective whether or not they exhibit pathological changes, unless stated otherwise. In a preferred embodiment the patient according to the invention is a human. Preferably, the patient in the context of the present invention has a primary disease not being an infection and the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, in serum or plasma samples of said patient is below 0.25 ng/mL. In the present invention, the term “prognosis” denotes a prediction of how a subject's (e.g. a patient's) medical condition will progress. This may include an estimation of the chance of recovery or the chance of an adverse outcome for said subject. As mentioned herein in the context of proteins or peptides, the term “fragment” refers to smaller proteins or peptides derivable from larger proteins or peptides, which hence comprise a partial sequence of the larger protein or peptide. Said fragments are derivable from the larger proteins or peptides by saponification of one or more of its peptide bonds. Procalcitonin is a 116 amino acids comprising peptide. Smaller variants, such as for instance PCT 3-116 and others, exist as well. Thus the length of procalcitonin fragments is at least 12 amino acids, preferably more than 50 amino acids, more preferably more than 110 amino acids. Preferably herein, said risk of contracting a further disease or medical condition is related to an existing bacterial infection, particularly a local infection. A local infection may facilitate, accelerate and/or enhance the risk of contracting or acquiring a further disease or medical condition in a patient having a non-infectious primary disease. In particularly preferred embodiments of the in vitro method, said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof is indicative for a bacterial infection in the patient. It is further preferred that said infection is a local infection. A local infection herein relates to all infections being less severe than a sepsis. A sepsis is defined as an infection being associated with the “Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome” (“SIRS”) (Levy M M et al. 2001 SCCM/ESICM/ACCP/ATS/SIS International Sepsis Definitions Conference. Crit Care Med. 2003 April; 31(4):1250-6). The local infection may for example be an infection in the oral cavity, at the teeth or the root of the teeth, infection in wounds, infection in the respiratory tract, or haemorrhoids, or others. Said local infection herein may be treated by administration of an antibiotic. Treatment of the local infection leads to a decreased risk of the patient for acquiring the further disease or medical condition. Hence, in a preferred embodiment of the in vitro method, said bacterial infection is treatable with an antibiotic. In this case it is preferred, that the risk of contracting a further disease or medical condition decreases when the patient is treated with an antibiotic. The correlating step of the in vitro method of the present invention preferably comprises comparing said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof to a threshold level, whereby, when said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof exceeds said threshold level, said patient is predisposed to said risk. Said threshold level is preferably between 0.02 and 0.25 ng/mL, more preferably between 0.02 and 0.1 ng/mL, even more preferably at about 0.05 (+/−0.01) ng/mL, and most preferably at about 0.03 (+/−0.01) ng/mL. Definition of these threshold levels comes from the analysis of the frequency distribution of PCT level ranges shown in the histogram of appended FIG. 1 and Example 1. In a particular embodiment said primary disease is not arteriosclerosis. In another embodiment said primary disease is not heart failure. It is in some embodiments of the invention said primary disease is not an acute coronary syndrome. Furthermore, it is in a particular embodiment preferred that said primary disease is not a coronary disease. In a particular embodiment the further disease or medical condition is not selected from the group comprising acute coronary syndrome, heart failure or myocardial infarction. In one embodiment said further disease or medical condition is not an infection, particularly not an infection of the airways and lungs. In another embodiment of the in vitro method according to the invention, said primary disease is selected from but not restricted to the group comprising cancer, diabetes, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, chronic renal diseases, hypertension, orthopaedic diseases including osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative diseases including Alzheimer's disease. Furthermore, in another embodiment said further disease or medical condition is selected from the group comprising cardiological diseases selected from but not restricted to the group comprising atherosclerosis, acute coronary syndromes and heart failure. The primary disease herein relates to a disease which is already manifested and/or is already symptomatic. The further disease or medical condition relates to a disease which is not yet manifested and/or is not yet symptomatic. The sample from the patient may for example be selected from the group comprising a blood sample, a serum sample, a plasma sample, and an urine sample or an extract of any of the aforementioned samples. In a particular embodiment of the invention, the in vitro method further comprises mathematically combining said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof with the level of one or more additional prognostic biomarkers, whereby the combination of said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof with said level of additional prognostic biomarker(s) increases the predictive value of said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof or the level of said related biomarker for said risk of contracting a further disease or medical condition. In the context of the present invention, an “algorithm” or “mathematical algorithm” refers to the use of a mathematical or statistical method or model used to compare a certain measured value with values of a reference population in order to stratify said measured value. This may for instance be the median of the level of a certain entity in an ensemble of pre-determined samples, which means that the measured level of said entity is compared with the mathematical median of the level of said entity in a given number of samples. The number of samples used to determine the median is not particularly limited, but should be sufficient in order to ensure statistical significance of the median. The number of samples used to determine the median may even increase over the course of time, as the results of further measurement values from clinical samples are added in order to increase the statistic significance of the median. Preferably, the sample number is chosen such that statistical significance of the median is ensured. Thus, said median is used as a reference value, whereby the measured level of the aforementioned entity can be statistically correlated with a certain physiological state, e.g. the propensity of an adverse outcome for a patient, depending on the relative level above or below the median and the extent of deviation of the measured value from said median. In place of the median, other statistical methods, such as the determination of quantiles (e.g. quartiles or percentiles) or mathematical models, preferably Cox Regression may be used analogously to the above description in order to obtain the above-mentioned reference value and/or otherwise determine the significance of a measured value with respect to the physiological status of a given subject from which the sample has been obtained. Said mathematical or statistical methods or models are well known to the person skilled in the art and the use thereof in the context of medicinal applications is well established. The “term” biomarker (biological marker) relates to measurable and quantifiable biological parameters (e.g., specific enzyme concentration, specific hormone concentration, specific gene phenotype distribution in a population, presence of biological substances) which serve as indices for health- and physiology-related assessments, such as disease risk, psychiatric disorders, environmental exposure and its effects, disease diagnosis, metabolic processes, substance abuse, pregnancy, cell line development, epidemiologic studies, etc. Furthermore, a biomarker is defined as a characteristic that is objectively measured and evaluated as an indicator of normal biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic intervention. A biomarker may be measured on a biosample (as a blood, urine, or tissue test), it may be a recording obtained from a person (blood pressure, ECO, or Holter), or it may be an imaging test (echocardiogram or CT scan) (Vasan et al. 2006, Circulation 113:2335-2362). Biomarkers can indicate a variety of health or disease characteristics, including the level or type of exposure to an environmental factor, genetic susceptibility, genetic responses to exposures, biomarkers of subclinical or clinical disease, or indicators of response to therapy. Thus, a simplistic way to think of biomarkers is as indicators of disease trait (risk factor or risk biomarker), disease state (preclinical or clinical), or disease rate (progression). Accordingly, biomarkers can be classified as antecedent biomarkers (identifying the risk of developing an illness), screening biomarkers (screening for subclinical disease), diagnostic biomarkers (recognizing overt disease), staging biomarkers (categorizing disease severity), or prognostic biomarkers (predicting future disease course, including recurrence and response to therapy, and monitoring efficacy of therapy). Biomarkers may also serve as surrogate end points. A surrogate end point is one that can be used as an outcome in clinical trials to evaluate safety and effectiveness of therapies in lieu of measurement of the true outcome of interest. The underlying principle is that alterations in the surrogate end point track closely with changes in the outcome of interest. Surrogate end points have the advantage that they may be gathered in a shorter time frame and with less expense than end points such as morbidity and mortality, which require large clinical trials for evaluation. Additional values of surrogate end points include the fact that they are closer to the exposure/intervention of interest and may be easier to relate causally than more distant clinical events. An important disadvantage of surrogate end points is that if clinical outcome of interest is influenced by numerous factors (in addition to the surrogate end point), residual confounding may reduce the validity of the surrogate end point. It has been suggested that the validity of a surrogate end point is greater if it can explain at least 50% of the effect of an exposure or intervention on the outcome of interest. For instance, a biomarker may be a protein, peptide or a nucleic acid molecule. One of said prognostic biomarker(s) is preferably proBNP or fragments thereof in a sample obtained from said patient. More preferably, said fragment of proBNP is NT pro-BNP or BNP. In a particular embodiment, the in vitro method further comprises determining the level of one or more additional prognostic biomarkers in a sample obtained from said patient, and correlating both said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof and said level of one or more additional prognostic biomarkers to said predisposition to a risk, whereby the combination of said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof with said level of one or more additional prognostic biomarkers increases the predictive value of said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof for said risk. The additional prognostic biomarker may for example be selected from a group comprising troponin, myeloperoxidase, CRP, neopterin, GDF-15, ST2, cystatin-C, as well as the following peptides in form of their mature peptides, prohormones (precursors) and associated prohormone fragments: natriuretic peptides, adrenomedullin, endothelins, vasopressin. Preferably, the correlation between said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof and said level of one or more additional prognostic biomarkers is conducted with a mathematical algorithm. In a further aspect the present invention relates to the use of an ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay having a lower limit of detection of below about 0.05 ng/mL, preferably below about 0.04 ng/mL, more preferably below about 0.03 ng/mL, most preferably below about 0.02 ng/mL for determining in a patient having a primary disease not being an infection the risk of the patient to contract a further disease or medical condition which has not yet been manifested and/or is not yet symptomatic. In a preferred embodiment of the use of the ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay, the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length or a mixture of procalicitonin and/or fragments thereof, is determined in a sample from said patient. In one embodiment the level of only one fragment is determined. In another embodiment the level of a mixture of procalicitonin and/or fragments thereof is determined. As mentioned herein, an “assay” or “diagnostic assay” can be of any type applied in the field of diagnostics, including but not restricted to assays methods based on enzymatic reactions, luminescence, fluorescence or radiochemicals. The preferred detection methods comprise rapid tests (point-of-care tests), radioimmunoassays, chemiluminescence- and fluorescence-immunoassays, Immunoblot assays, Enzyme-linked immunoassays (ELISA), Luminex-based bead arrays, and protein microarray assays. The assay types can further be microtitre plate-based, chip-based, bead-based, wherein the biomarkers can be attached to the surface or in solution. The assays can be homogenous or heterogeneous assays, sandwich assays, competitive and non-competitive assays. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the assay is in the form of a sandwich assay, which is a noncompetitive immunoassay, wherein the molecule to be detected and/or quantified is bound to a first antibody and to a second antibody. The first antibody may be bound to a solid phase, e.g. a bead, a surface of a well or other container, a chip or a strip, and the second antibody is an antibody which is labeled, e.g. with a dye, with a radioisotope, or a reactive or catalytically active moiety. The amount of labeled antibody on the site is then measured by an appropriate method. The general composition and procedures involved with “sandwich assays” are well-established and known to the skilled person (The Immunoassay Handbook, Ed. David Wild, Elsevier LTD, Oxford; 3rd ed. (May 2005), ISBN-13: 978-0080445267; Hultschig C et al., Curr Opin Chem Biol. 2006 February; 10(1):4-10. PMID: 16376134), incorporated herein by reference. In a particularly preferred embodiment the assay comprises two capture molecules (capture probes), preferably antibodies which are both present as dispersions in a liquid reaction mixture, wherein a first marking component is attached to the first capture molecule, wherein said first marking component is part of a marking system based on fluorescence- or chemiluminescence-quenching or amplification, and a second marking component of said marking system is attached to the second capture molecule, so that upon binding of both capture molecules to the analyte to be detected, a measurable signal is generated that allows for the detection of the formed sandwich complexes in the solution comprising the sample. In the context of the present invention, a capture probe may be selected from the group comprising a nucleic acid molecule, particularly an aptamer, a carbohydrate molecule, a PNA molecule, a protein, an antibody, a peptide, particularly a cyclic peptide or a glycoprotein. Even more preferred, said marking system comprises rare earth cryptates or rare earth chelates in combination with a fluorescence dye or chemiluminescence dye, in particular a dye of the cyanine type. In the context of the present invention, fluorescence based assays comprise the use of dyes, which may for instance be selected from the group comprising FAM (5- or 6-carboxyfluorescein), VIC, NED, Fluorescein, Fluoresceinisothiocyanate (FITC), IRD-700/800, Cyanine dyes, such as CY3, CY5, CY3.5, CY5.5, Cy7, Xanthen, 6-Carboxy-2′,4′,7′,4,7-hexachlorofluorescein (HEX), TET, 6-Carboxy-4′,5′-dichloro-2′,7′-dimethodyfluorescein (JOE), N,N,N′,N′-Tetramethyl-6-carboxyrhodamine (TAMRA), 6-Carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX), 5-Carboxyrhodamine-6G (R6G5), 6-carboxyrhodamine-6G (RG6), Rhodamine, Rhodamine Green, Rhodamine Red, Rhodamine 110, BODIPY dyes, such as BODIPY TMR, Oregon Green, Coumarines such as Umbelliferone, Benzimides, such as Hoechst 33258; Phenanthridines, such as Texas Red, Yakima Yellow, Alexa Fluor, PET, Ethidiumbromide, Acridinium dyes, Carbazol dyes, Phenoxazine dyes, Porphyrine dyes, Polymethin dyes, and the like. In the context of the present invention, chemiluminescence based assays comprise the use of dyes, based on the physical principles described for chemiluminescent materials in Kirk-Othmer, Encyclopedia of chemical technology, 4th ed., executive editor, J. I. Kroschwitz; editor, M. Howe-Grant, John Wiley & Sons, 1993, vol. 15, p. 518-562, incorporated herein by reference, including citations on pages 551-562. Preferred chemiluminescent dyes are acridinium esters. In the context of the present invention, the term “ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay” means that the assay for the detection of procalcitonin or fragments thereof and/or quantification of the level thereof has a lower limit of detection of below about 0.05 ng/mL, preferably below about 0.04 ng/mL, more preferably below about 0.03 ng/mL, most preferably below about 0.02 ng/mL. An ultrasensitive PCT assay is for example the PCT sensitive LIA (Luminescence Immuno Assay) Kit (B.R.A.H.M.S AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany, Product No. 109.050). PCT levels in the context of the present invention may for example be determined with an assay as described above, preferably with the PCT sensitive LIA (Luminescence Immuno Assay) Kit (B.R.A.H.M.S AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany, Product No. 109.050) as in example 1 or following the general procedure described in example 2. The use of an ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay is preferably for stratifying the risk for contracting a further disease or medical in a patient having a primary disease. The ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay may be used for the control of the treatment or prevention of said further disease or medical condition. Preferably said treatment or prevention comprises administration of an antibiotic to the patient. The ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay may for example be a sandwich assay comprising two antibodies against different moieties of procalcitonin. In a particular embodiment of the use of the ultrasensitive procalcitonin assay, one antibody is against the calcitonin moiety of procalcitonin, and the other antibody is a monoclonal antibody against the katacalcin moiety of procalcitonin. In the context of the present invention, the term “calcitonin moiety of procalcitonin” refers to a polypeptide comprising the amino acids 85-116 of pre-procalcitonin. In the context of the present invention, the “katacalcin moiety of procalcitonin” refers to a polypeptide comprising the amino acids 121-141 of pre-procalcitonin. The above amino acid numbers refer to the sequence of human pre-procalcitonin as listed in Protein data bank entry http://www.expasy.ch/uniprot/P01258. Also encompassed are amino acid sequences of analogous origin analogous in other species, as well as polypeptides with preferably, at least 90%, more preferably at least 95%, most preferably at least 98% sequence homology to the above-mentioned human polypeptides. In yet another aspect the present invention relates to an antibiotic for the use in the treatment of a local infection for the prevention of a further disease or medical condition which has not yet been manifested in a patient having a primary disease, wherein said primary disease is not an infection and wherein the antibiotic is administered when the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, in a sample of the patient selected from the group comprising a blood sample, a serum sample and a plasma sample, is between 0.02 and 0.25 ng/mL, preferably between 0.02 and 0.1 ng/mL. Preferably, the risk of contracting a further disease or medical condition decreases when the said patient is treated with an antibiotic. In a further aspect the invention relates to an in vitro method for diagnosis of the presence of a bacterial infection in a patient, the method comprising: determining the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, in a sample obtained from said patient: (i) at least once before the start of said antibiotic treatment or within six hours after the start of the treatment, and (ii) at least once after 12 hours to 1 week after the start of an antibiotic treatment of the patient; and correlating said level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof to the presence of a bacterial infection, wherein a decrease of said level of at least 20% per 24 h ng/mL is indicative for the presence of a bacterial infection in the patient. Preferably, the patient has a primary disease not being an infection and the level of procalcitonin or fragments thereof of at least 12 amino acids in length, in serum or plasma samples of said patient is below 0.25 ng/mL. The term “antibiotic” in the context of the present invention refers to a chemical substance, which has the capacity to inhibit the growth of or to kill microorganisms.

Most preferably, the term relates to ampicillin, cefotaxime, erythromycin, tetracycline, ciprofloxacin, co-trimoxazole, gentamicin, metronidazole, bacitracin or clindomycin. EXAMPLES Example 1: Determination of Procalcitonin Levels in Samples of Patients with Various Primary Diseases 4997 consecutive blood sera samples of patients of a clinical lab have been analyzed to determine the level of procalcitonin (PCT) using the B R.A.H.M.S PCT sensitive LIA (Luminescence Immuno Assay) Kit (B.R.A.H.M.S AG, Hennigsdorf, Germany, Product No. 109.050). The patients sera have been sent for analysis to the lab by different consulting specialist physicians from various medical fields, such as nephrology, urology, oncology, pediatrics, internal medicine, general medicine and others. The assay has been performed according to the manual shipped with the kit, except that the sample volume has been increased form 50 μL to 100 μL to increase the functional assay sensitivity (FAS) and to reliably determine the PCT concentrations in the lower concentration range (0.05 to 0.25 ng/mL). The frequencies of the determined PCT levels have been plotted in a histogram (see appended FIG. 1). 66.7% of the sera samples showed PCT levels above 0.017 ng/mL, 26.0% of the sera samples showed PCT concentrations of above 0.03 ng/mL and 14.0% of the sera samples showed PCT levels of above 0.05 ng/mL. The samples having PCT concentrations above 0.05 ng/mL (i.e. 702 samples out of 4997 samples) have been classified according to the medical field of the consulting specialist physician from which the respective sample originated. This correlation is plotted in appended FIG. 2. The high number of patients having a primary disease not being an infection but nevertheless having PCT levels above 0.03 ng/mL and 0.05 ng/mL, respectively, is a surprising finding. Example 2: General Procedure for the Determination of Procalcitonin Levels in Samples of Patients Procalcitonin (PCT) can be measured as described (Morgenthaler N G et al.: Clin Chem, 2002 May, 48(5), 788-790). Sheep antibodies were raised against the calcitonin moiety of PCT, and a mouse monoclonal antibody was raised against the katacalcin moiety of PCT. Tubes were coated with the anti-katacalcin antibody. The anti-Calcitonin antibody was labelled with MACN Acridiniumester (InVent GmbH, Hennigsdorf, Germany) and served as tracer. Dilutions of recombinant PCT in normal horse serum served as standards. 100 μl sample or standard were incubated in the coated tubes for 30 minutes, 200 μl tracer were added. After incubation for 2 h the tubes were washed 4 times with 1 ml of LIA wash solution (B.R.A.H.M.S AG), and bound. Chemiluminescence was measured using a LB952T luminometer (Berthold, Germany).

This Sequence Listing consists of SEQ ID NOs:1-25. BACKGROUND OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure relates generally to compositions and methods for regulating the blood coagulation pathway. More particularly, the present disclosure relates to the use of thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins as blood anticoagulants. Also disclosed is the use of thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins to treat sepsis. Thrombin (coagulation factor II, EC 3.4.21.5) is a serine protease involved in the coagulation cascade. Thrombin is formed by the proteolytic cleavage of prothrombin. Thrombin promotes coagulation by converting factor XI to factor XIa, factor VIII to factor VIIIa, factor V to factor Va, factor XIII to factor XIIIa, and soluble fibrinogen into insoluble strands of fibrin. The production of thrombin in vivo occurs through a series of intermediate forms, including prothrombin, prethrombin-1, and prethrombin-2. Each step involves a highly regulated cleavage of the precursor form of thrombin, until mature thrombin is produced. Mature thrombin is formed of two polypeptide chains, the A chain and the B chain, with a disulfide bond between the A and the B chain, and can be produced by cleavage of prethrombin-2 at a specific site. Thrombin also functions as one of the key components in the homeostasis of the coagulation cascade. The specific binding of fibrinogen and PAR-1 to the exosite-1 of thrombin leads to the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, platelet activation and clot formation. The pro-coagulant activity of thrombin can be switched to an anticoagulant activity when the very same exosite-1 is bound to the cofactor thrombomodulin (TM). Thrombomodulin is an integral membrane protein expressed on the surface of endothelial cells and serves as a cofactor for thrombin. The binding of thrombin and thrombomodulin results in the activation of protein C by 1500-fold and activation of protein C promotes the inactivation of the coagulation cascade. Specifically, activated protein C then degrades clotting factors Va and VIIIa. Once in circulation, activated protein C shuts down the coagulation cascade by degrading factor Va and VIIIa and, in turn, ends thrombin generation and prevents further clotting. Thus, the formation of the thrombin-thrombomodulin complex enables the most powerful enzymatic anticoagulant system that exists in vivo. Congenital or acquired protein C and thrombin mutations/deficiencies are established risk factors of thrombosis. Formation of thrombus in a blood vessel can reduce blood flow to a tissue, resulting in hypoxia and accumulation of metabolic products. A larger thrombus causing a much greater obstruction to the blood flow may result in anoxia, the complete deprivation of oxygen and infarction, tissue death. A clot that forms to prevent bleeding can break free and travel around the body, which can result in reduced blood flow to a tissue or tissue death. The current list of anticoagulant drugs available to treat coagulation disorders targets different key factors of the coagulation cascade, mostly inhibiting procoagulant factors. None of those has successfully achieved a stimulation of the anticoagulant pathway through activation of protein C, however. Accordingly, there exists a need to develop anticoagulant/antithrombotic agents and uses of anticoagulant/antithrombotic agents as blood anticoagulants. BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE The present disclosure is generally directed to compositions and methods for regulating the blood coagulation pathway. More particularly, particularly, the present disclosure relates to the use of thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins as blood anticoagulants. Also disclosed are uses of thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins to treat sepsis. In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein comprising a thrombin domain and a thrombomodulin domain. In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to composition comprising a thrombin domain, a linker domain, wherein the linker domain ranges from about 20 amino acid residues to about 50 amino acid residues; and a thrombomodulin domain. In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for treating thrombosis in an individual in need thereof. The method comprises: administering to an individual in need thereof a composition comprising a thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein, wherein the individual has or is suspected of having a blood clot. In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for treating sepsis in an individual in need thereof. The method comprises administering to an individual in need thereof a composition comprising a thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein, wherein the individual has or is suspected of having sepsis. In accordance with the present disclosure, uses of thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins have been discovered that allow for use as blood anticoagulants. The compositions and methods of the present disclosure have a broad and significant impact, as they provide new agents that function as powerful anticoagulants and treatments for sepsis.

It should be understood, however, that the description of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the disclosure to cover all modifications, equivalents and alternatives falling within the spirit and scope of the disclosure as defined by the appended claims. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DISCLOSURE Unless defined otherwise, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which the disclosure belongs. Although any methods and materials similar to or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, the preferred methods and materials are described below. Disclosed herein are thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins useful to treat thrombosis and sepsis. The thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins of the present disclosure exploit the exclusive role of thrombomodulin to convert thrombin into a potent anticoagulant. Administration of the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins of the present disclosure enables on-demand generation of activated protein C (aPC) in the body by taking advantage of the natural pool of protein C to generate, in the body, aPC. The thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins of the present disclosure also enable the activation of protein C without the need for endogenous or co-administration of thrombomodulin. Activating protein C in vivo has been demonstrated in animal models of stroke using other protein C activating compounds. Thrombin-Thrombomodulin Fusion Proteins In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins. The thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein includes a thrombin domain and a thrombomodulin domain. The thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins can further include a linker domain The thrombin domain can be a full-length thrombin polypeptide, a preprothrombin polypeptide, a prothrombin polypeptide, a prethrombin 1 polypeptide, a prethrombin 2 polypeptide, a thrombin A chain, a thrombin B chain, and combinations thereof. A particularly suitable thrombin domain is prethrombin 1. The preprothrombin amino acid sequence (from UniProtKB database accession number P00734) represents the full thrombin polypeptide as it is initially expressed. Amino acids 1-24 of SEQ ID NO:1 are the signal peptide, and amino acids 25-43 of SEQ ID NO:1 are a propeptide that is removed to form prothrombin (amino acids 44-622 of SEQ ID NO:1). Amino acids 44-198 of SEQ ID NO:1 are removed when prothrombin is cleaved by thrombin to form prethrombin-1 (amino acids 199-622 of SEQ ID NO:1). Amino acids 199-327 of SEQ ID NO: 1 are removed when prethrombin-1 is cleaved by activated factor X (Xa) (or other enzymes) to form prethrombin-2 (amino acids 328-622 of SEQ ID NO:1). Finally, prethrombin-2 is cleaved by Xa to form the A chain (also called the light chain) (amino acids 328-363 of SEQ ID NO:1), and the B chain (also called the heavy chain) (amino acids 364-622 of SEQ ID NO:1) of mature thrombin. A suitable thrombin domain can have a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. A suitable thrombin domain can have a nucleotide sequence at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:2. Another suitable thrombin domain can have a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:4. A suitable thrombin domain can have a nucleotide sequence at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:4. SEQ ID NO:4 includes an ecarin cleavage site encoded by the nucleotides located at positions 493-501 of SEQ ID NO:4. Percent identity of two sequences can be determined by aligning the sequences for optimal comparison. For example, gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with the second nucleic acid sequence. The same can be done for optimal alignment of amino acid sequences. The nucleotides or amino acid residues at corresponding positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same nucleotide or amino acid as at the corresponding position in the second sequence, the nucleic acids or amino acids are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical nucleotides or amino acids shared by the sequences. Hence, percent identity=[number of identical nucleotides/total number of overlapping positions]×100 or percent identity=[number of identical amino acids/total number of overlapping positions]×100. The percentage of sequence identity can be calculated according to this formula by comparing two optimally aligned sequences being compared, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid or amino acid occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions (the “number of identical positions” in the formula above), dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions being compared (the “total number of overlapping positions” in the formula above), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percent sequence identity. In this comparison, the sequences can be the same length or may be different in length. Optimal alignment of sequences for determining a comparison window can be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsh (1972), by the search for similarity via the method of Pearson and Lipman (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetic Computer Group, 575, Science Drive, Madison, Wis.), or by inspection. A suitable thrombin domain can have an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3. A suitable thrombin domain can have an amino acid sequence at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:3. Another suitable thrombin domain can have an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5. A suitable thrombin domain can have an amino acid sequence at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:5. SEQ ID NO:5 includes an ecarin cleavage site located at amino acid residues 165-167 of SEQ ID NO:5. The thrombin domain can further include a thrombin variant. The double thrombin mutant referred to as W215A/E217A thrombin (or “WE-thrombin variant”) is constructed by combining the two single mutations W215A and E217A in the human thrombin molecule (as described in Cantwell and Di Cera, J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275:39827-39830, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety). W215A and E217A refer to amino acid residue positions in the thrombin amino acid residue sequence using the position numbers as described in Bode et al. (EMBO J 1989; 8(11):3467-3475, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety) that corresponds to amino acids 590 and 592 of SEQ ID NO: 1, respectively. Another suitable thrombin variant can be a WE thrombin variant of SEQ ID NO:3 in which the tryptophan (single amino acid letter code W) residue at 430 of SEQ ID NO:3 is substituted with an alanine (W430→A430) and the glutamic acid (single amino acid letter code E) residue at 432 is substituted with an alanine (E432→A432). Another suitable thrombin variant can be a WE thrombin variant of SEQ ID NO:5 in which the tryptophan (single amino acid letter code W) residue at 430 of SEQ ID NO:5 is substituted with an alanine (W430→A430) and the glutamic acid (single amino acid letter code E) residue at 432 is substituted with an alanine (E432→A432). The human thrombin referred to as the E-WE-thrombin variant is a WE-thrombin variant that has been produced in E. coli (US Patent Application Publication 2012/0164129 A1). WE thrombin variants have enhanced protein C activating properties, and reduced fibrinogen-cleaving activity, making them highly anticoagulant thrombins. Other suitable thrombin variants are described in a large number of thrombin polypeptide variants have been characterized in Marino et al., (J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285(25):19145-19152), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The activity of thrombin variants can be analyzed using variety of in vitro assays including, for example, cleavage of prothrombin, cleavage of fibrinogen, and cleavage of fibrin; the activation of protein C, and the interaction with PAR-1 (Cantwell and Di Cera, J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275(51): 39827-39830). Anticoagulant effects of thrombin variants can also be determined using in vivo assays in experimental animals.

Methods for Treating Thrombosis in an Individual in Need Thereof using Thrombin-Thrombomodulin Fusion Proteins In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of treating thrombosis in an individual in need thereof. The method includes administering a composition comprising a thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein to an individual in need thereof, wherein the individual has or is suspected of having a blood clot. Particularly suitable thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins are described herein. As used herein, “individual in need thereof” refers to an individual susceptible to or at risk of a specified disease, disorder, or condition. More particularly, in the present disclosure the methods of treating thrombosis can be used with an individual or subset of individuals who have, are susceptible to, and at elevated risk for experiencing thrombosis (blood clots). Particularly suitable individuals in need thereof include those having or suspected of having deep vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, jugular vein thrombosis, Budd-Chiari Syndrome, Paget-Schoetter disease, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, abnormal blood flow due to venous stasis following heart failure, abnormal blood flow due to sedentary behavior, atrial fibrillation, cancer, surgery, and embolism. The method can further include administering an antidote to the individual in need thereof. An antidote can be administered to the individual to reduce or block the activity of the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein. Methods for Treating Sepsis in an Individual in Need Thereof using Thrombin-Thrombomodulin Fusion Proteins In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for treating sepsis in an individual in need thereof. The method includes administering a composition comprising a thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein to an individual in need thereof. As used herein, “individual in need thereof” refers to an individual susceptible to or at risk of a specified disease, disorder, or condition. More particularly, in the present disclosure the methods of treating thrombosis can be used with an individual or subset of individuals who have, are susceptible to, and at elevated risk for experiencing sepsis, including severe sepsis and septic shock. As known to those skilled in the art, a diagnosis of sepsis is made when an individual exhibits at least two sepsis symptoms, plus a probable or confirmed infection. Sepsis symptoms include: body temperature above 101° F. (38.3° C.) or below 96.8° F. (36° C.); heart rate higher than 90 beats per minute; and respiratory rate higher than 20 breaths per minute. A sepsis diagnosis can be upgraded to severe sepsis when an individual also exhibits at least one sign or symptom including: significantly decreased urine output; abrupt change in mental status; decreased platelet count; difficulty breathing; abnormal heart pumping function; and abdominal pain. A diagnosis of septic shock can be made when an individual has the signs and symptoms of severe sepsis and an extremely low blood pressure that does not adequately respond to simple fluid replacement as determined by those skilled in the art such as medical professionals. Thrombomodulin is an endothelial transmembrane protein and its highest concentration in the circulation is detected in the capillary bed or microcirculation. The role of endothelial thrombomodulin recruiting thrombin from the turbulent blood flow and converting it to an anticoagulant enzyme is disrupted under pathological conditions such as sepsis. This leads to scarce activation of protein C, localized coagulation and thrombosis. In sepsis, endothelial cell expression of thrombomodulin is strongly downregulated, causing an impaired activation of protein C that is central in the modulation of coagulation activation and inflammatory processes. In addition, thrombomodulin itself has marked immunomodulatory effects, targeting neutrophil adhesion, complement activation and cytokine generation. The method can further include administering an antidote to the individual in need thereof. An antidote can be administered to the individual to reduce or block the activity of the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein. The disclosure will be more fully understood upon consideration of the following non-limiting Examples. EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of Thrombin-Thrombomodulin Fusion Proteins In this Example, the preparation of a DNA construct encoding thrombin-linker-thrombomodulin fusion proteins is described. A plasmid-encoding prethrombin-1 cDNA containing a factor V secretion peptide and a HPC4 purification epitope at the N-terminus served as starting genetic material. Using PCR, cDNA encoding soluble Epidermal Grown Factors or EGF domains of thrombomodulin (known as TM456) was fused before the ending codon of the prethrombin 1 sequence. At the junction between prethrombin-1 and TM456 different linkers containing repetitive sequences of glycine, serine and alanine residues were introduced. An additional restriction site for ecarin venom cleavage-activation was inserted into the prethrombin-1 cDNA for activation and purification purposes. DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. A total of 7 fusion proteins with linkers spanning 7-69 residues were expressed in mammalian cells and purified to homogeneity. Example 2 In this Example, kinetic experiments of thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins were performed. Kinetic experiments were performed to compare the activity of thrombin and the fusion proteins towards procoagulant substrates (fibrinogen and PAR-1) and the anticoagulant substrate protein C. The specificity of cleavage (kcat/Km) for each fusion protein towards each substrate is reported in table 1. When compared with thrombin, the fusion proteins displayed a significant reduction of fibrinogen and PAR-1 cleavage.

 As shown in FIG. 1, the clotting time was also prolonged up to 50 fold (FIG. 1B). On the other hand, even in the absence of exogenous thrombomodulin, protein C activation was retained (FIG. 1A). The best performing fusion proteins had a peptide linker ranging from about 20 amino acid residues to about 50 amino acid residues. Unexpectedly, Short (less than about 20 amino acid residues) and long peptide linkers (exceeding about 50 amino acid residues) impaired optimal docking to exosite-1. As shown in FIG. 1C, 400 nM of a thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein using a WE thrombin domain and a 31 amino acid residue linker had a decreased aPTT ratio protein C deficient (PC Def) plasma as compared to normal plasma. As demonstrated herein, the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins of the present disclosure exhibit selective reduction towards procoagulant substrates. Results presented herein demonstrated that fibrinogen and PAR-1 cleavage were compromised by 50000-fold. Unexpectedly, while protein C activation was also reduced, the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins worked well as anticoagulants and prolonged the aPTT time in a dose-dependent manner. Example 3 In this Example, pharmacodynamics effects of the thrombin-linker-thrombomodulin fusion proteins are described. Approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee will be obtained. The pharmacodynamic effects of the thrombin-linker-thrombomodulin fusion proteins will be studied in a primate model of hemostasis and thrombosis. Baboons will be administered the thrombin-linker-thrombomodulin fusion proteins via high-flow exteriorized arteriovenous shunts. Following administration, bleeding time measurements and blood sampling will be obtained from restrained, conscious seated animals. Anxiety, if noted, will be managed with low-dose ketamine (maximum: 2 mg/kg per hour) with or without diazepam (0.5 mg/kg per hour). All pharmacological agents will be injected into, and blood samples will be collected from, the shunts. Blood sampling will be restricted to less than 2% of the blood volume on any experimental day. Treatments will be administered by intravenous infusion. The effects of intravenous thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins will be systematically evaluated in and around the reported clinically relevant dose range of interventional indications. Studies with higher doses are expected to increase bleeding risk in the animals. The equiefficacious doses of the fusion proteins will be determined by administering a dosage range of from 2 μg/kg per hour to 2 mg/kg per hour. The test dosage range will be expanded to dosages lower than 2 μg/kg per hour and higher than 2 mg/kg per hour to identify the lowest dosage resulting in the anticoagulant effect and the highest dosage resulting in increased bleeding risk. The hemostatic safety of the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein administration will be assessed as prolongation of the standard template skin bleeding time in comparison with the pretreatment baseline. The measurements will be performed using an FDA-approved incision device (Surgicutt; International Technidyne, Edison, N.J.). Sequential cuts will be performed as instructed immediately before and approximately 40 minutes after the start of treatments. Any prolongation will be considered to be an antihemostatic effect. Unlike several other bleeding time tests, this test has been shown to be sensitive for the detection of changes in hemostasis during the treatment of patients with antithrombotic or hemostatic products. The test has also been shown to be sensitive to the hemorrhagic effects of virtually all tested antithrombotic agents at antithrombotic doses, including direct thrombin inhibitors, activated protein C preparations, or glycoprotein αIIbβ3 inhibitors under experimental conditions in the baboon. Other safety observations will include hemoglobin and hematocrit measurements, as well as thorough clinical monitoring of the study subjects. In brief, every animal will receive 125I-labeled purified baboon fibrinogen and 111In-tropolone-labeled autologous platelets for quantitative assessment of thrombus formation. Thrombus-forming conduit segments will be deployed into the arteriovenous shunts during the last 60 minutes of anticoagulation. The device will consist of a 0.25-mL volume prosthetic vascular graft (4-mm ID), followed distally by a 20-mm long connector tubing and a 1.27-mL volume 9-mm ID silicone rubber extension segment (“thrombus chamber”). The flow rate will be restricted to 100 mL/min during the experiment. Thrombosis will be quantified as the total amount of deposited fibrin in the thrombus chamber. Inhibition of fibrin deposition in the thrombus chamber will be quantified to establish the equiefficacious doses of the fusion proteins. Real-time assessment of platelet deposition in the thrombus chamber will provide additional information about thrombogenesis. Fibrin and platelet deposition will also be determined in the graft segments. Blood samples (0.9 mL) will be collected into 0.1 mL 3.2% citrate and 0.1 mL citrate/benzamidine to monitor select coagulation parameters immediately before and several times during thrombogenic device placements. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test will be used for monitoring the systemic effect of each injected fusion protein. The APTT will be determined in citrated plasma using a commercial point-of-care test (Rapid Point Coag; Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, N.Y.) between 5 and 7 minutes after blood drawing. To investigate the association between circulating APC levels and hemostatic safety or antithrombotic efficacy of the fusion proteins, APC levels will also be determined in treated animals using frozen citrate/benzamidine plasma samples. The protein C zymogen levels will be measured as described to assess potential substrate depletion during treatment. Additional EDTA-anticoagulated samples will be used for thrombus size calculations as described and for monitoring potential adverse events, such as platelet and fibrinogen consumption, or bleeding. It is expected that the fusion proteins will be antithrombotic and prolong the template bleeding time.

Although any methods and materials similar to or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the present disclosure, the preferred methods and materials are described below. Disclosed herein are thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins useful to treat thrombosis and sepsis. The thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins of the present disclosure exploit the exclusive role of thrombomodulin to convert thrombin into a potent anticoagulant. Administration of the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins of the present disclosure enables on-demand generation of activated protein C (aPC) in the body by taking advantage of the natural pool of protein C to generate, in the body, aPC. The thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins of the present disclosure also enable the activation of protein C without the need for endogenous or co-administration of thrombomodulin. Activating protein C in vivo has been demonstrated in animal models of stroke using other protein C activating compounds. Thrombin-Thrombomodulin Fusion Proteins In one aspect, the present disclosure is directed to thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins. The thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein includes a thrombin domain and a thrombomodulin domain. The thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins can further include a linker domain The thrombin domain can be a full-length thrombin polypeptide, a preprothrombin polypeptide, a prothrombin polypeptide, a prethrombin 1 polypeptide, a prethrombin 2 polypeptide, a thrombin A chain, a thrombin B chain, and combinations thereof. A particularly suitable thrombin domain is prethrombin 1. The preprothrombin amino acid sequence (from UniProtKB database accession number P00734) represents the full thrombin polypeptide as it is initially expressed. Amino acids 1-24 of SEQ ID NO:1 are the signal peptide, and amino acids 25-43 of SEQ ID NO:1 are a propeptide that is removed to form prothrombin (amino acids 44-622 of SEQ ID NO:1). Amino acids 44-198 of SEQ ID NO:1 are removed when prothrombin is cleaved by thrombin to form prethrombin-1 (amino acids 199-622 of SEQ ID NO:1). Amino acids 199-327 of SEQ ID NO: 1 are removed when prethrombin-1 is cleaved by activated factor X (Xa) (or other enzymes) to form prethrombin-2 (amino acids 328-622 of SEQ ID NO:1). Finally, prethrombin-2 is cleaved by Xa to form the A chain (also called the light chain) (amino acids 328-363 of SEQ ID NO:1), and the B chain (also called the heavy chain) (amino acids 364-622 of SEQ ID NO:1) of mature thrombin. A suitable thrombin domain can have a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:2. A suitable thrombin domain can have a nucleotide sequence at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:2. Another suitable thrombin domain can have a nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:4. A suitable thrombin domain can have a nucleotide sequence at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:4. SEQ ID NO:4 includes an ecarin cleavage site encoded by the nucleotides located at positions 493-501 of SEQ ID NO:4. Percent identity of two sequences can be determined by aligning the sequences for optimal comparison. For example, gaps can be introduced in the sequence of a first nucleic acid sequence for optimal alignment with the second nucleic acid sequence. The same can be done for optimal alignment of amino acid sequences. The nucleotides or amino acid residues at corresponding positions are then compared. When a position in the first sequence is occupied by the same nucleotide or amino acid as at the corresponding position in the second sequence, the nucleic acids or amino acids are identical at that position. The percent identity between the two sequences is a function of the number of identical nucleotides or amino acids shared by the sequences. Hence, percent identity=[number of identical nucleotides/total number of overlapping positions]×100 or percent identity=[number of identical amino acids/total number of overlapping positions]×100. The percentage of sequence identity can be calculated according to this formula by comparing two optimally aligned sequences being compared, determining the number of positions at which the identical nucleic acid or amino acid occurs in both sequences to yield the number of matched positions (the “number of identical positions” in the formula above), dividing the number of matched positions by the total number of positions being compared (the “total number of overlapping positions” in the formula above), and multiplying the result by 100 to yield the percent sequence identity. In this comparison, the sequences can be the same length or may be different in length. Optimal alignment of sequences for determining a comparison window can be conducted by the local homology algorithm of Smith and Waterman (1981), by the homology alignment algorithm of Needleman and Wunsh (1972), by the search for similarity via the method of Pearson and Lipman (1988), by computerized implementations of these algorithms (GAP, BESTFIT, FASTA and TFASTA in the Wisconsin Genetics Software Package Release 7.0, Genetic Computer Group, 575, Science Drive, Madison, Wis.), or by inspection. A suitable thrombin domain can have an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:3. A suitable thrombin domain can have an amino acid sequence at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:3. Another suitable thrombin domain can have an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:5. A suitable thrombin domain can have an amino acid sequence at least 80%, at least 85%, at least 90%, at least 91%, at least 92%, at least 93%, at least 94%, at least 95%, at least 96%, at least 97%, at least 98%, or at least 99% identical to SEQ ID NO:5. SEQ ID NO:5 includes an ecarin cleavage site located at amino acid residues 165-167 of SEQ ID NO:5. The thrombin domain can further include a thrombin variant. The double thrombin mutant referred to as W215A/E217A thrombin (or “WE-thrombin variant”) is constructed by combining the two single mutations W215A and E217A in the human thrombin molecule (as described in Cantwell and Di Cera, J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275:39827-39830, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety). W215A and E217A refer to amino acid residue positions in the thrombin amino acid residue sequence using the position numbers as described in Bode et al. (EMBO J 1989; 8(11):3467-3475, which is incorporated by reference in its entirety) that corresponds to amino acids 590 and 592 of SEQ ID NO: 1, respectively. Another suitable thrombin variant can be a WE thrombin variant of SEQ ID NO:3 in which the tryptophan (single amino acid letter code W) residue at 430 of SEQ ID NO:3 is substituted with an alanine (W430→A430) and the glutamic acid (single amino acid letter code E) residue at 432 is substituted with an alanine (E432→A432). Another suitable thrombin variant can be a WE thrombin variant of SEQ ID NO:5 in which the tryptophan (single amino acid letter code W) residue at 430 of SEQ ID NO:5 is substituted with an alanine (W430→A430) and the glutamic acid (single amino acid letter code E) residue at 432 is substituted with an alanine (E432→A432). The human thrombin referred to as the E-WE-thrombin variant is a WE-thrombin variant that has been produced in E. coli (US Patent Application Publication 2012/0164129 A1). WE thrombin variants have enhanced protein C activating properties, and reduced fibrinogen-cleaving activity, making them highly anticoagulant thrombins. Other suitable thrombin variants are described in a large number of thrombin polypeptide variants have been characterized in Marino et al., (J. Biol. Chem. 2010; 285(25):19145-19152), which is incorporated by reference in its entirety. The activity of thrombin variants can be analyzed using variety of in vitro assays including, for example, cleavage of prothrombin, cleavage of fibrinogen, and cleavage of fibrin; the activation of protein C, and the interaction with PAR-1 (Cantwell and Di Cera, J. Biol. Chem. 2000; 275(51): 39827-39830). Anticoagulant effects of thrombin variants can also be determined using in vivo assays in experimental animals. The thrombomodulin domain can be a full-length thrombomodulin protein. A particularly suitable thrombomodulin domain can be thrombomodulin's epidermal growth factor-like domains 456 (TM456).

Suitable peptide linkers can range from about 20 amino acid residues to about 50 amino acid residues. Particularly suitable linker domains can range from about 30 amino acid residues to about 41 amino acid residues. Particularly suitable linkers are flexible linkers enriched in small amino acids and polar amino acids such as, for example, glycine and serine. Exemplary peptide linkers are shown in Table 1.

For example, the glycine amino acid at position 362 of SEQ ID NO:1 can be replaced with a proline. The isoleucine at position 364 of SEQ ID NO:1 can be replaced with a glycine. A particularly suitable protease cleavage site can be at least one ecarin cleavage site. A second ecarin cleavage site is not necessary, but slows down processing to alpha thrombin. Ecarin is a snake venom-derived protease isolated from Echis carinate. The cleavage site specifically recognized by ecarin is arginine-isoleucine.

Suitable phosphatide reagents can be, for example, ACTIN® and DADE® ACTIN® (commercially available from Siemens Healthcare Diagnostics, Inc., Tarrytown, N.Y.). The thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins can also be analyzed in kinetic experiments toward procoagulant substrates such as, for example, fibrinogen and PAR-1. Particularly suitable thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins have a protein C activation ranging from about 80 mM−1sec−1 to about 110 mM−1sec−1.

Methods for Treating Thrombosis in an Individual in Need Thereof using Thrombin-Thrombomodulin Fusion Proteins In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method of treating thrombosis in an individual in need thereof. The method includes administering a composition comprising a thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein to an individual in need thereof, wherein the individual has or is suspected of having a blood clot. Particularly suitable thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins are described herein. As used herein, “individual in need thereof” refers to an individual susceptible to or at risk of a specified disease, disorder, or condition. More particularly, in the present disclosure the methods of treating thrombosis can be used with an individual or subset of individuals who have, are susceptible to, and at elevated risk for experiencing thrombosis (blood clots). Particularly suitable individuals in need thereof include those having or suspected of having deep vein thrombosis, portal vein thrombosis, renal vein thrombosis, jugular vein thrombosis, Budd-Chiari Syndrome, Paget-Schoetter disease, cerebral venous sinus thrombosis, arterial thrombosis, stroke, myocardial infarction, abnormal blood flow due to venous stasis following heart failure, abnormal blood flow due to sedentary behavior, atrial fibrillation, cancer, surgery, and embolism. The method can further include administering an antidote to the individual in need thereof. An antidote can be administered to the individual to reduce or block the activity of the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein. Methods for Treating Sepsis in an Individual in Need Thereof using Thrombin-Thrombomodulin Fusion Proteins In another aspect, the present disclosure is directed to a method for treating sepsis in an individual in need thereof. The method includes administering a composition comprising a thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein to an individual in need thereof. As used herein, “individual in need thereof” refers to an individual susceptible to or at risk of a specified disease, disorder, or condition. More particularly, in the present disclosure the methods of treating thrombosis can be used with an individual or subset of individuals who have, are susceptible to, and at elevated risk for experiencing sepsis, including severe sepsis and septic shock. As known to those skilled in the art, a diagnosis of sepsis is made when an individual exhibits at least two sepsis symptoms, plus a probable or confirmed infection. Sepsis symptoms include: body temperature above 101° F. (38.3° C.) or below 96.8° F. (36° C.); heart rate higher than 90 beats per minute; and respiratory rate higher than 20 breaths per minute. A sepsis diagnosis can be upgraded to severe sepsis when an individual also exhibits at least one sign or symptom including: significantly decreased urine output; abrupt change in mental status; decreased platelet count; difficulty breathing; abnormal heart pumping function; and abdominal pain. A diagnosis of septic shock can be made when an individual has the signs and symptoms of severe sepsis and an extremely low blood pressure that does not adequately respond to simple fluid replacement as determined by those skilled in the art such as medical professionals. Thrombomodulin is an endothelial transmembrane protein and its highest concentration in the circulation is detected in the capillary bed or microcirculation. The role of endothelial thrombomodulin recruiting thrombin from the turbulent blood flow and converting it to an anticoagulant enzyme is disrupted under pathological conditions such as sepsis. This leads to scarce activation of protein C, localized coagulation and thrombosis. In sepsis, endothelial cell expression of thrombomodulin is strongly downregulated, causing an impaired activation of protein C that is central in the modulation of coagulation activation and inflammatory processes. In addition, thrombomodulin itself has marked immunomodulatory effects, targeting neutrophil adhesion, complement activation and cytokine generation. The method can further include administering an antidote to the individual in need thereof. An antidote can be administered to the individual to reduce or block the activity of the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein. The disclosure will be more fully understood upon consideration of the following non-limiting Examples. EXAMPLES Example 1 Preparation of Thrombin-Thrombomodulin Fusion Proteins In this Example, the preparation of a DNA construct encoding thrombin-linker-thrombomodulin fusion proteins is described. A plasmid-encoding prethrombin-1 cDNA containing a factor V secretion peptide and a HPC4 purification epitope at the N-terminus served as starting genetic material. Using PCR, cDNA encoding soluble Epidermal Grown Factors or EGF domains of thrombomodulin (known as TM456) was fused before the ending codon of the prethrombin 1 sequence. At the junction between prethrombin-1 and TM456 different linkers containing repetitive sequences of glycine, serine and alanine residues were introduced. An additional restriction site for ecarin venom cleavage-activation was inserted into the prethrombin-1 cDNA for activation and purification purposes. DNA constructs were verified by DNA sequencing. A total of 7 fusion proteins with linkers spanning 7-69 residues were expressed in mammalian cells and purified to homogeneity. Example 2 In this Example, kinetic experiments of thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins were performed. Kinetic experiments were performed to compare the activity of thrombin and the fusion proteins towards procoagulant substrates (fibrinogen and PAR-1) and the anticoagulant substrate protein C. The specificity of cleavage (kcat/Km) for each fusion protein towards each substrate is reported in table 1. When compared with thrombin, the fusion proteins displayed a significant reduction of fibrinogen and PAR-1 cleavage.

 As shown in FIG. 1, the clotting time was also prolonged up to 50 fold (FIG. 1B). On the other hand, even in the absence of exogenous thrombomodulin, protein C activation was retained (FIG. 1A). The best performing fusion proteins had a peptide linker ranging from about 20 amino acid residues to about 50 amino acid residues. Unexpectedly, Short (less than about 20 amino acid residues) and long peptide linkers (exceeding about 50 amino acid residues) impaired optimal docking to exosite-1. As shown in FIG. 1C, 400 nM of a thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein using a WE thrombin domain and a 31 amino acid residue linker had a decreased aPTT ratio protein C deficient (PC Def) plasma as compared to normal plasma. As demonstrated herein, the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins of the present disclosure exhibit selective reduction towards procoagulant substrates. Results presented herein demonstrated that fibrinogen and PAR-1 cleavage were compromised by 50000-fold. Unexpectedly, while protein C activation was also reduced, the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins worked well as anticoagulants and prolonged the aPTT time in a dose-dependent manner. Example 3 In this Example, pharmacodynamics effects of the thrombin-linker-thrombomodulin fusion proteins are described. Approval of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee will be obtained. The pharmacodynamic effects of the thrombin-linker-thrombomodulin fusion proteins will be studied in a primate model of hemostasis and thrombosis. Baboons will be administered the thrombin-linker-thrombomodulin fusion proteins via high-flow exteriorized arteriovenous shunts. Following administration, bleeding time measurements and blood sampling will be obtained from restrained, conscious seated animals. Anxiety, if noted, will be managed with low-dose ketamine (maximum: 2 mg/kg per hour) with or without diazepam (0.5 mg/kg per hour). All pharmacological agents will be injected into, and blood samples will be collected from, the shunts. Blood sampling will be restricted to less than 2% of the blood volume on any experimental day. Treatments will be administered by intravenous infusion. The effects of intravenous thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion proteins will be systematically evaluated in and around the reported clinically relevant dose range of interventional indications. Studies with higher doses are expected to increase bleeding risk in the animals. The equiefficacious doses of the fusion proteins will be determined by administering a dosage range of from 2 μg/kg per hour to 2 mg/kg per hour. The test dosage range will be expanded to dosages lower than 2 μg/kg per hour and higher than 2 mg/kg per hour to identify the lowest dosage resulting in the anticoagulant effect and the highest dosage resulting in increased bleeding risk. The hemostatic safety of the thrombin-thrombomodulin fusion protein administration will be assessed as prolongation of the standard template skin bleeding time in comparison with the pretreatment baseline. The measurements will be performed using an FDA-approved incision device (Surgicutt; International Technidyne, Edison, N.J.). Sequential cuts will be performed as instructed immediately before and approximately 40 minutes after the start of treatments. Any prolongation will be considered to be an antihemostatic effect. Unlike several other bleeding time tests, this test has been shown to be sensitive for the detection of changes in hemostasis during the treatment of patients with antithrombotic or hemostatic products. The test has also been shown to be sensitive to the hemorrhagic effects of virtually all tested antithrombotic agents at antithrombotic doses, including direct thrombin inhibitors, activated protein C preparations, or glycoprotein αIIbβ3 inhibitors under experimental conditions in the baboon. Other safety observations will include hemoglobin and hematocrit measurements, as well as thorough clinical monitoring of the study subjects. In brief, every animal will receive 125I-labeled purified baboon fibrinogen and 111In-tropolone-labeled autologous platelets for quantitative assessment of thrombus formation. Thrombus-forming conduit segments will be deployed into the arteriovenous shunts during the last 60 minutes of anticoagulation. The device will consist of a 0.25-mL volume prosthetic vascular graft (4-mm ID), followed distally by a 20-mm long connector tubing and a 1.27-mL volume 9-mm ID silicone rubber extension segment (“thrombus chamber”). The flow rate will be restricted to 100 mL/min during the experiment. Thrombosis will be quantified as the total amount of deposited fibrin in the thrombus chamber. Inhibition of fibrin deposition in the thrombus chamber will be quantified to establish the equiefficacious doses of the fusion proteins. Real-time assessment of platelet deposition in the thrombus chamber will provide additional information about thrombogenesis. Fibrin and platelet deposition will also be determined in the graft segments. Blood samples (0.9 mL) will be collected into 0.1 mL 3.2% citrate and 0.1 mL citrate/benzamidine to monitor select coagulation parameters immediately before and several times during thrombogenic device placements. The activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) test will be used for monitoring the systemic effect of each injected fusion protein. The APTT will be determined in citrated plasma using a commercial point-of-care test (Rapid Point Coag; Bayer Diagnostics, Tarrytown, N.Y.) between 5 and 7 minutes after blood drawing. To investigate the association between circulating APC levels and hemostatic safety or antithrombotic efficacy of the fusion proteins, APC levels will also be determined in treated animals using frozen citrate/benzamidine plasma samples. The protein C zymogen levels will be measured as described to assess potential substrate depletion during treatment. Additional EDTA-anticoagulated samples will be used for thrombus size calculations as described and for monitoring potential adverse events, such as platelet and fibrinogen consumption, or bleeding. It is expected that the fusion proteins will be antithrombotic and prolong the template bleeding time.

","TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a conjugate comprising a hANP peptide loaded on a Fc-containing molecule serving as a carrier, whereby the hANP peptide gradually migrates into blood after subcutaneous administration and the duration time of the pharmacological effect of hANP is drastically prolonged, a medicament containing the same as an active ingredient, a method for producing the conjugate, etc. BACKGROUND ART Human atrial natriuretic peptides (hANPs) are biologically active peptides having a vasodilatory effect, a diuretic effect, a cell growth inhibitory effect, a venous return lowering effect, and a sympathetic activity inhibitory effect. Native hANP rapidly loses its activity in blood, for example, through cleavage by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the blood. In Japan, hANP is clinically applied as a therapeutic drug for acute heart failure, but needs to be continuously administered via intravenous infusion or the like, under blood pressure monitoring, for the purpose of avoiding a sharp drop in blood pressure after administration. Endogenous biologically active peptides such as hANP have very high selectivity for their specific receptors and can therefore be expected to have high efficacy and safety. On the other hand, such biologically active peptides are known to have a very short half-life in blood because the biologically active peptide are rapidly metabolized by various metabolic enzymes during systemic circulation or rapidly excreted by glomerular filtration in the kidney. Hence, attempts have been made to prolong the half-lives in blood of such peptides by imparting metabolic enzyme resistance thereto or circumventing renal excretion. Examples thereof include various methods such as a glycosylated peptide (Patent Literature 1), a fusion polypeptide (Patent Literature 2), an albumin fusion peptide (Patent Literature 3 and Non Patent Literature 1), an immunoglobulin Fc fusion peptide (Patent Literature 4 and Non Patent Literature 2), and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified peptide (Non Patent Literatures 3 and 4). Antibody drugs have a very long half-life in blood as compared with peptide drugs or protein drugs, through a recycling mechanism mediated by a neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) (Non Patent Literature 5). Hence, fusion peptides expected to produce a similar recycling effect have also been considered as a means of prolonging the half-life of hANP (Patent Literatures 3 and 4 and Non Patent Literatures 1 and 2). However, it has been suggested that when hANP, which is rapidly metabolized in blood, is directly loaded onto a carrier protein, the hANP moiety on the carrier undergoes metabolism during circulation. Thus, “hANP-protein fusions” are difficult to retain in the blood at a level equivalent to the retention, in the blood, of the carrier protein moiety (Non Patent Literature 2). In recent years, the technical development of antibody-drug conjugates has been actively performed, and various synthesis methods have been reported (Non Patent Literatures 6, 7, and 8). However, if a conjugation method that diminishes the compatibility of a carrier protein with a drug moiety to be loaded thereon is adopted, the carrier moiety or the drug moiety might be destabilized so that the half-life in blood is not prolonged or agglutination is increased. Therefore, it is very important to select the optimum conjugation method or linker. In general, biopharmaceuticals are known to migrate gradually into the blood by subcutaneous administration rather than intravenous administration (Non Patent Literature 9). However, it is difficult to predict the pharmacokinetics of chemically-modified antibodies. Thus, there is a demand for the development of hANP formulations that possess all of the following: gradual migration into the blood, a sufficient retention time in the blood, and maintenance of activity necessary for pharmacological effects.

Solution to Problem The present inventors have conducted diligent studies on an improved form of hANP that possesses both drug efficacy and safety in subcutaneous administration, and consequently found that: a conjugate comprising a hANP peptide linked via a particular PEG linker to a glycan attached to an Asn residue corresponding to position 297 of an IgG heavy chain elevated the intracellular cGMP concentration in GC-A receptor-expressing cells, prolonged the duration time in the blood of the hANP peptide when administered to rats, and sustainably elevated the cGMP concentration in the blood even 168 hours or later after administration of the conjugate; a conjugate employing glycosylated hANP as the hANP peptide has particularly favorable physical properties; etc. The present inventors have conducted further studies, thereby reaching the completion of the present invention.

 DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, the present invention will be described in detail. The present invention provides a conjugate comprising a hANP peptide linked via a PEG linker to a N-linked glycan attached to asparagine (Asn297) conserved in a Fc-containing molecule (N297 glycan), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The conjugate of the present invention is a large molecule in which a plurality of structural units such as the hANP peptide, the PEG linker, the Fc-containing molecule, and partial structures constituting them are linked. A schematic diagram of this structure is shown in FIG. 1. In the present invention, the term “linked”, when describing a plurality of structural units means that these structural units are bonded directly through a covalent bond or indirectly via a linker so that the structural units exist in one molecule. The chemical structure that links the structural units is not particularly limited. The structural units constituting the conjugate of the present invention have a very large molecular weight and a complicated structure and therefore, may also be described in a simplified form through the use of symbols for the sake of convenience. In such symbolic description, the hANP peptide is referred to as “hANP”, the PEG linker is referred to as “L(PEG)” or “PEG(n)” (“n” being the number of consecutive ethylene glycol units (structural units (—CH2—CH2—O—)) contained therein), the N297 glycan contained in the Fc-containing molecule is referred to as “N297 GLY”, and the Fc-containing molecule is referred to as “mAb”, “CLCH”, or “Fc”. The glycan is also indicated by “SG”, etc., as mentioned later. Each bond between the structural units may be omitted from a symbolic description for a general binding pattern, whereas a characteristic structure or functional group may be indicated by an expression usually used in the field of organic synthetic chemistry. In the notation of the conjugate of the present invention or a partial structure thereof, the N terminus (amino group) and the C terminus (carboxyl group) of an amino acid or a peptide are indicated on the left and on the right, respectively, unless otherwise specified. An amino acid or a peptide with the symbol “*” on the right (e.g., Gln*) represents that contrary to this rule, the C terminus and the N terminus are indicated on the left and on the right, respectively. In the notation of an amino acid, an amino group and a carboxyl group, which are structures essential to an amino acid, directly bonded to the central carbon atom (a carbon) are referred to as an “a amino group” and an “a carboxyl group”, respectively. In the notation of the conjugate or a partial structure thereof in the present specification, when an amino acid or a peptide is linked at its N terminal amino group to another linker, a symbol representing the structural unit to be linked is indicated with a hyphen and without parentheses on the left side of a symbol representing this peptide or amino acid. In this case, the hyphen represents the amide bond formed between the amino group of the peptide or the amino acid and the carboxyl group carried by the linker structure. For example, a structure where SG is linked to the amino group of Asn is referred to as “SG-Asn”. By contrast, when an amino acid or a peptide is linked at its C terminal carboxyl group to another structural unit in the present specification, a symbol representing the structural unit to be linked is indicated with a hyphen and without parentheses on the right side of a symbol representing this amino acid or peptide. In this case, the hyphen represents the amide bond formed between the C terminal carboxyl group of the peptide or the amino acid and the amino group (or azide group) carried by the linker structure. For example, a structure where SG is linked to the carboxyl group of Tyr is referred to as “Tyr-SG”. When an amino acid is linked at its side chain to a glycan in the present specification, the partial structure is referred to as, for example, “(SG-)Asn” with the side chain moiety included in the parentheses. In the present invention, the “glycan” means a structural unit of two or more monosaccharides bonded to each other through a glycosidic bond. A specific monosaccharide or glycan is also indicated by an abbreviation, for example, “GlcNAc-” or “SG-”. When the glycan is represented by a structural formula with these abbreviations, an oxygen atom or a nitrogen atom belonging to the glycosidic bond at the reducing end with another structural unit is excluded from the abbreviations representing the glycan, unless otherwise defined. In the present specification, the monosaccharide serving as the basic unit of the glycan is indicated in its ring structure where a carbon atom bonded to an oxygen atom constituting the ring and directly bonded to the hydroxy group (or the oxygen atom belonging to the glycosidic bond) is defined as the 1-position (2-position only for sialic acid) for the sake of convenience, unless otherwise specified. The compounds of Examples are named in the light of their whole chemical structures, so that this rule is not necessarily applicable thereto. The monosaccharide contained in the glycan is not particularly limited as long as the monosaccharide has the basic structure of a sugar. Various monosaccharides such as 6-membered and 5-membered sugars can be used. The monosaccharide may be a naturally occurring sugar or may be an artificially synthesized sugar. A naturally occurring sugar is preferred. Examples of the monosaccharide can include glucose (Glu), fructose (Fru), mannose (Man), galactose (Gal), glucosamine (Glc), N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc), glucuronic acid (GlucA), neuraminic acid (Neu), sialic acid/N-acetylneuraminic acid (Sia/NeuNAc/Neu5Ac), galactosamine, N-acetylgalactosamine (GalNAc), xylose (Xyl), iduronic acid (IdoA), fucose (Fuc), aldotriose, glyceraldehyde, aldotetrose, erythrose, threose, aldopentose, ribose, lyxose, arabinose, aldohexose, allose, talose, gulose, aldose, idose, ketotriose, dihydroxyacetone, ketotetrose, erythrulose, ketopentose, xylulose, ribulose, ketohexose, psicose, sorbose, and tagatose. When the glycan is indicated by a symbol (e.g., GLY, SG, or GlcNAc) in the present specification, this symbol also includes carbon at the reducing end and excludes N or O belonging to the N- or O-glycosidic bond, unless otherwise defined. Likewise, when the hANP peptide is indicated by a symbol (e.g., hANP or hANP(1-28)), the symbol also includes N terminal —NH and C terminal C═O as a rule. The N terminus and the C terminus are indicated on the left and on the right, respectively, unless otherwise specified. Specifically, an unmodified hANP peptide is referred to as H-hANP-OH. <hANP Peptide> In the present invention, the “hANP peptide” means a peptide consisting of an amino acid sequence comprising at least amino acids at the 7- to 27-positions in the amino acid sequence of human atrial natriuretic peptide (SEQ ID NO: 1; hereinafter, referred to as native hANP or hANP(1-28)), which is a biologically active peptide consisting of 28 amino acids. The native hANP exerts its biological activity by binding to a GC-A receptor (Chinkers M, et al., Nature 338; 78-83, 1989)) expressed on the cell surface, activating guanylate cyclase present in the intracellular domain of the receptor, and elevating the intracellular cGMP concentration. As for the native hANP, α-hANP described in Biochem. Biophys. Res. Commun., vol. 118, p. 131, 1984, has been approved for manufacture and sale under the generic name of “carperitide” in Japan and is commercially available (trade name: HANP). α-hANP is also generally known as Human pro-ANP[99-126]. Native hANP has an intramolecular ring structure formed by Cys residues at the 7- and 23-positions of SEQ ID NO: 1 through a disulfide bond. It is known that this ring structure and the C terminal amino acids up to the Arg residue at the 27-position are important for the activation of the GC-A receptor by hANP (Silver, M A, Curr. Opin. Nephrol. Hypertens. (2006), 15, p. 14-21; and A. Calderone, Minerva Endocrinol. (2004), 29, p. 113-127). hANP(7-27) consisting of this ring structure is therefore considered as the minimum unit for activating GC-A. The hANP peptide of the present invention is a peptide consisting of an amino acid sequence that may lack 1 to 6 amino acids consecutively from the N terminus and/or an amino acid at the 28-position in SEQ ID NO: 1), and is preferably a peptide that may lack at least one of the amino acid sites of the 1-position, the 1- and 2-positions, and the 28-position of SEQ ID NO: 1, more preferably a peptide consisting of an amino acid sequence that may lack an amino acid at the 1-position or amino acids at the 1- and 2-positions of SEQ ID NO: 1 (hANP(2-28), hANP(3-28), etc.), most preferably a peptide consisting of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 (hANP(1-28)). In the present invention, the peptide shown in SEQ ID NO: 1 is referred to as “hANP(1-28)”, the peptide lacking an amino acid at the 1-position of SEQ ID NO: 1 is referred to as “hANP(2-28)”, and the peptide lacking amino acids at the 1- and 2-positions of SEQ ID NO: 1 is referred to as “hANP(3-28)”, for example. Other peptides lacking a portion of amino acids are also referred to in a manner corresponding to that shown above. The number of hANP molecules in one molecule of the conjugate of the present invention varies depending on the structure of the N297 glycan bonded to the Fc-containing molecule or the PEG linker and is usually 2 or 4. In the conjugate of the present invention, the PEG linker can be bonded to the hANP peptide through, for example, an amide bond with the N terminal α-amino group or the C terminal α-carboxyl group. Preferably, the PEG linker is bonded to the N terminus of the hANP peptide. In the conjugate of the present invention, the hANP peptide may be glycosylated. Various forms of the glycosylation of the hANP peptide are described in Patent Literature 1. Diverse glycosylated peptides can be applied to the present invention through the use of these forms of glycosylation. A glycan structurally similar to a glycan present in the bodies of humans is appropriately adopted as the glycan for use in the modification of the hANP peptide. Glycans contained in natural glycoproteins are broadly classified into N-linked glycans attached to asparagine of a glycoprotein and O-linked glycans attached to serine or threonine thereof, both of which have their characteristic basic structures. Naturally, the N-linked glycan is bonded through a N-glycosidic bond to the amino acid side chain of a protein, while the 0-linked glycan is bonded through an O-glycosidic bond thereto. Artificial glycans can be bonded to other compounds through any glycosidic bond. Thus, the type of glycosidic bond is not limited by the structure of such a glycan. For example, the glycan is azidated at its reducing end, and this azidated glycan can be reacted with a compound having a carboxyl group in the presence of triphenylphosphine to bond the compound having the desired structure to the glycan through a N-glycosidic bond. Alternatively, the glycan can be reacted with a compound having a hydroxy group, such as an alcohol, to bond the glycan to the desired compound through an O-glycosidic bond. The basic structure of the N-linked glycan is represented by the following structural formula and sequence. A glycan having this glycan structure is designated as AG5. 


 wherein “-(N/Q)” represents binding to the side chain of Asn or Gln through a N-glycosidic bond. Most of the N-linked glycans have this basic structure. Its non-reducing end or branched sugar may be further bonded to another sugar. Human glycans or human-compatible glycans are glycans known to exhibit no antigenicity in the bodies of humans. For example, high-mannose, complex, and composite forms of N-linked glycans are known. The high-mannose form is a glycan having a mannose-rich structure composed of a plurality of consecutive mannose residues at the non-reducing end of the N-linked basic structure. The complex form is a glycan having a Galβ1-4GlcNAc motif structure at the non-reducing end of the N-linked basic structure. The composite glycan is a glycan having a Galβ1-4GlcNAc motif structure at the non-reducing end of the N-linked basic structure and also having a mannose-rich structure composed of a plurality of mannose residues. The N-linked complex glycan is typically a glycan contained in sialyl glycopeptide (hereinafter, referred to as “SGP”) contained in chicken egg yolk. Examples thereof can include sialyl glycan (hereinafter, referred to as “SG”) having a structure represented by the following structural formula and sequence: 


 wherein “-(N/Q)” represents binding to the side chain of Asn or Gln through a N-glycosidic bond. SGP can be isolated and purified from chicken egg yolk according to common methods, for example, a method described in WO2011/0278681. Alternatively, a purified product of SGP is commercially available (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd. or Fushimi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) and can be purchased. Also, for example, disialooctasaccharide (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) consisting only of a glycan lacking one GlcNAc at the reducing end of the glycan moiety of SG (hereinafter, this glycan is referred to as “SG(10)”) is commercially available. In the present specification, a glycan structure lacking sialic acid at the non-reducing end of only any one of the two branched chains of SG(10) β-Man is referred to as MSG(9), a glycan structure having sialic acid only in the 1-3 branched chain of the glycan is referred to as MSG1(9), and a glycan structure having sialic acid only in the 1-6 branched chain of the glycan is referred to as MSG2(9). The glycan engineered at the reducing end by the replacement of GlcNAc at the reducing end of SG with another sugar can be prepared using the disialosaccharide through the use of a known transglycosylation reaction. The glycan engineered at the reducing end by the replacement of GlcNAc at the reducing end of SG with Glc is referred to as SG(Glc). The glycan engineered at the reducing end by the replacement of GlcNAc at the reducing end of SG with Man is referred to as SG(Man). Specific examples of the engineered glycan that may be used as the glycan of the present invention can include AG9 (a structural formula and a sequence of AG9 are given below) which lacks Neu5Ac residues at the two non-reducing ends as a result of the neuraminidase treatment of SG, AG(7) (a structural formula and a sequence of AG7 are given below) which lacks Gal residues at the two non-reducing ends as a result of the galactosidase treatment of AG9, and AG5 (glycan having the N-linked basic structure, described above) which lacks GlcNAc residues at the two non-reducing ends as a result of the further treatment of AG7 with N-acetylglucosaminidase. Also, glycans engineered at the reducing ends of AG(9), AG(7) and AG(5) (e.g. AG(9-Glc) with GlcNAc at the reducing end of AG(9) replaced with Glc, and AG(9-Man) with GlcNAc at the reducing end of AG(9) replaced with Man) can be obtained by the same treatment as above using the glycan engineered at the reducing end of SG (e.g., SG(Glc) or SG(Man)) instead of SG and can be adopted for the glycosylation of the present invention. 


 wherein “-(N/Q)” represents binding to the side chain of Asn or Gln through a N-glycosidic bond. 


 wherein “-(N/Q)” represents binding to the side chain of Asn or Gln through a N-glycosidic bond. In the conjugate of the present invention, there is no upper limit on the number of glycans bonded to the hANP peptide. The number of glycans is, for example, 3 or fewer, preferably 2 or 1. The glycans attached to the hANP peptide may have the same structure or may be a mixture of glycans differing in structure. Preferably, all of these glycans have the same glycan structure. One example of the glycosylated hANP peptide of the present invention can include a hANP peptide comprising a N-linked glycan, as mentioned above, attached to the side chain of Asn or Gln through a N-glycosidic bond (“(GLY-)Asn” or “(GLY-)Gln”. In such a peptide, any one or a plurality of amino acids at the 1- to 5- and 28-positions of the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 may be replaced with (GLY-)Asn or (GLY-)Gln. Alternatively, (GLY-)Asn or (GLY-)Gln may be bonded through a peptide bond to any one or both of the N-terminus and C-terminus of a peptide consisting of a consecutive amino acid sequence comprising the 6- to 27-positions of SEQ ID NO: 1. Such a peptide is preferably a peptide with (GLY-)Asn or (GLY-)Gln bonded through a peptide bond to the N terminus and/or C terminus of hANP(1-28), hANP(2-28), hANP(3-28), hANP(4-28), hANP(5-28), or hANP(6-28), more preferably a peptide with (SG-)Asn or (SG-)Gln bonded through a peptide bond to the N terminus of hANP(1-28), hANP(2-28) or hANP(3-28), even more preferably (SG-)Asn-hANP(1-28). In the present invention, in the case of using a naturally occurring glycoprotein- or glycolipid-derived glycan as the glycan for use in the modification of the hANP peptide, this glycan can be used after being cleaved or isolated by use of hydrolase or transferred to the desired compound (acceptor compound) through transglycosylation using glycosyltransferase, in accordance with a method described in, for example, Patent Literature 1. For example, SG can be isolated by the hydrolytic cleavage of SGP through reaction with hydrolase (EndoM, etc.), or by transfer to the desired compound by use of endoglycosidase(EndoM N175Q mutant, etc.), according to a known method. Also, SGP treated with peptidase such as actinase and thereby degraded into (SG-)Asn or a peptide fragment containing (SG-)Asn, and the glycan-bonded fraction can be purified by a known separation method to obtain a glycan-attached amino acid. (SG-)Asn, (SG-)Gln or the peptide fragment containing the same, thus obtained can be bonded to the N terminus and/or C terminus of the hANP peptide through a peptide bond by the usual reactions using a protective group to produce the glycosylated hANP peptide. <Fc-Containing Molecule> In the conjugate of the present invention, the “Fc-containing molecule” is linked to the hANP peptide via a glycan attached to the side chain of asparagine (referred to as “Asn297”; which undergoes modification by a N-linked glycan) well conserved in the IgG heavy chain Fc region (this glycan is referred to as a “N297 glycan”), and functions as a carrier protein for sustaining the hANP peptide for a long period in the blood. Therefore, the Fc-containing molecule needs to have an amino acid sequence corresponding to a human IgG Fc region and to have no ability to bind specifically to a human biomolecule. Examples of the amino acid sequence corresponding to an IgG Fc region can include an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 128 to 349 of SEQ ID NO: 7, an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 128 to 349 of SEQ ID NO: 11, an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 22 to 243 of SEQ ID NO: 15, an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 26 to 247 of SEQ ID NO: 17, and amino acid sequences engineered from these sequences. IgG consists of heavy and light chains. The heavy and light chains are linked through a disulfide bond, and the heavy chains are further linked at a hinge region to each other through a disulfide bond to form a homodimer. IgG also has a domain structure where Fab domains comprising variable regions and having the ability to bind to an antigen are linked via a hinge region to Fc domains binding to a Fc receptor. The Fc-containing molecule of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as the Fc-containing molecule comprises a Fc region. For example, a full-length IgG heavy chain, an antibody fragment containing a Fc region, or an engineered form derived from any of their amino acid sequences by partial engineering can be used. The Fc-containing molecule of the present invention may consist only of a heavy chain or may further have a light chain appropriate for the structure of the heavy chain. The subclass of IgG serving as an origin of the Fc-containing molecule is not particularly limited, and any subclass may be selected. The subclass is preferably IgG1, IgG2, IgG3 or IgG4, more preferably IgG1. The amino acid sequences of IgG constant regions are well conserved, and each amino acid is defined by the EU Index provided by Edelman et al. (Biochemistry, (1969) Vol. 63, pp. 78-85). For example, Asn297 to which a N-linked glycan is attached in the Fc region corresponds to the 297-position based on the EU Index. The amino acid is unambiguously identified by display according to the EU Index even if the actual amino acid position varies due to molecular fragmentation or regional deficiency. In the case of adopting full-length IgG as the Fc-containing molecule, the full-length IgG is not particularly limited as long as the IgG has no ability to bind specifically to a substance usually present in the bodies of humans. IgG directed to a nonhuman animal protein as an antigen might exhibit cross reactivity with a corresponding or related human molecule, if any. Therefore, it is preferred to select a monoclonal antibody against an antigen free from corresponding or related human molecules. Even an antibody that might bind to a substance in the bodies of humans can be adopted as the Fc-containing molecule of the present invention as long as the molecule has been modified so it lacks binding activity against the human substance as a result of introducing a mutation to its variable region by a genetic engineering approach. The full-length IgG for use as the Fc-containing molecule of the present invention is more preferably IgG directed to a nonmammalian organism-derived molecule as an antigen, even more preferably IgG directed to a microbe-derived molecule as an antigen, further preferably IgG directed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as an antigen. Such a monoclonal antibody is described in, for example, WO2015/046505. Specific examples thereof include mAb-A consisting of a combination of a heavy chain consisting of an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 20 to 474 of SEQ ID NO: 3 (amino acid positions 1 to 19 correspond to a signal peptide, and a nucleotide sequence encoding the heavy chain is shown in SEQ ID NO: 2), and a light chain consisting of an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 21 to 234 of SEQ ID NO: 5 (amino acid positions 1 to 20 correspond to a signal peptide, and a nucleotide sequence encoding the light chain is shown in SEQ ID NO: 4). In the case of adopting an antibody fragment or an engineered form as the Fc-containing molecule of the present invention, the antibody fragment or the engineered form is not particularly limited as long as the antibody fragment or the engineered form comprises a Fc region in a form that permits dimerization. Various sequences can be adopted. An engineered form that maintains a portion of or the whole of the variable regions may be adopted as long as the antibody serving as the source thereof has no ability to bind specifically to a human substance as mentioned above. A fragment or an engineered form lacking variable regions is preferred. Examples of such an engineered form can include CH lacking a human IgG heavy chain variable region and consisting of a human IgG heavy chain constant region. In the case of adopting CH as the Fc-containing molecule of the present invention, the subclass of IgG serving as a source thereof is not particularly limited. The amino acid sequence of CH derived from human IgG1 (this CH is referred to as “CH-A”) is shown in amino acid positions 20 to 349 of SEQ ID NO: 7 (the N terminal 1- to 19-positions correspond to a signal peptide, and a nucleotide sequence encoding CH-A is shown in SEQ ID NO: 6). In this sequence, the hinge region is EPKSCDKTHTCPPCP from Glu at the 118-position to Pro at the 132-position, the Fc region is from Ala at the 133-position to Lys at the 349-position, and Asn at the 199-position corresponds to Asn297 (the same holds true for SEQ ID NO: 11). In the case of selecting CH as the Fc-containing molecule, only CH may be adopted, or CLCH having CH in combination with CL consisting only of a light chain constant region may be adopted. The amino acid sequence of IgG1 light chain CL (referred to as “CL-A”) is shown in amino acid positions 21 to 125 of SEQ ID NO: 9 (N terminal amino acids at the 1- to 20-positions correspond to a signal peptide, and a nucleotide sequence encoding CL-A is shown in SEQ ID NO: 8). Preferred examples of the Fc-containing molecule of the present invention can include CLCH. CLCH-A having CH-A and CL-A in combination is more preferred. In the case of adopting a fragment or an engineered form composed mainly of a Fc region as the Fc-containing molecule of the present invention, for example, an antibody fragment consisting of the amino acid sequence of an IgG Fc region attached at its N terminus to the amino acid sequence CPPC, a portion of a hinge region can be adopted (an example of the sequence of IgG1 is a sequence from the 128- to 349-positions of SEQ ID NO: 7). The hinge region is a region that enhances the structural degree of freedom of the Fc-containing molecule and does not influence its function as a carrier protein as intended in the present invention. Therefore, the hinge region can be adopted with its length appropriately adjusted as long as the hinge region contains CPPC. Examples of such an antibody fragment composed mainly of Fc include an IgG1-derived Fc-containing molecule consisting of an amino acid sequence from Glu at the 118-position to Lys at the 349-position of SEQ ID NO: 7 or SEQ ID NO: 11 that may lack 1 to 10 amino acids consecutively from the N terminus of said amino acid sequence, and engineered forms engineered from its amino acid sequence. The antibody fragment composed mainly of Fc is preferably a Fc-containing molecule consisting of an amino acid sequence from Asp at the 123-position to Lys at the 349-position, Thr at the 127-position to Lys at the 349-position, or His at the 126-position to Lys at the 349-position of SEQ ID NO: 7. Examples of the molecules related to Fc-A and Fc-B can include a Fc-containing molecule consisting of an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 22 to 243 of SEQ ID NO: 15 or an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 26 to 247 of SEQ ID NO: 17, or an amino acid sequence thereof attached at its N terminus to amino acid residues T, HT, THT, KTHT or DKTHT, and engineered forms engineered from these amino acid sequences. The molecule is preferably a Fc-containing molecule consisting of an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 21 to 243 of SEQ ID NO: 15, an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 25 to 247 of SEQ ID NO: 17, or an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 21 to 247 of SEQ ID NO: 17. Asn297 in these Fc fragments is Asn at the 93-position of SEQ ID NO: 15 or Asn at the 97-position of SEQ ID NO: 17. In the case of designing an antibody fragment or an engineered form as the Fc-containing molecule of the present invention, an engineered form having the substitution, deletion, insertion and/or addition of 1 to several (preferably 20 or fewer, more preferably 15 or fewer, even more preferably 10 or fewer, further preferably 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2 or 1, per engineering site) amino acids at 1 to several sites (preferably 5 or fewer sites, more preferably 3, 2 or 1 site(s)) may be adopted without impairing functions as the carrier protein, as long as Cys for dimerization in the hinge region, Cys that contributes to an intramolecular disulfide bond in the Fc region, Asn297 for the attachment of the N297 glycan, and its neighboring amino acids are maintained. As for the engineering site in an amino acid sequence, the substitution, deletion and/or addition, etc. of N terminal and/or C terminal amino acid(s) is performed. Particularly, N terminal amino acids may influence the production of the Fc-containing molecule by a bioengineering approach and can be engineered into an amino acid sequence suitable for the desired production system. Amino acids Leu234 and Leu235 based on the EU Index are known as sites that influence the exhibition of effector activity by T cell activation through the binding of the antibody to a Fc receptor. Leu contained in this region may be replaced with Ala (the resulting mutant is referred to as a “LALA form”) so that this effector activity can be eliminated so as to reduce the risk of adverse reaction (U.S. Pat. No. 5,885,573). Such engineering may be carried out, if necessary. In Examples of the present invention, CLCH-B and Fc-A were prepared as a LALA form of CLCH-A and a LALA form of Fc-B, respectively, and confirmed to function properly as the carrier molecule in the conjugate of the present invention. A signal sequence, a peptidase recognition sequence, or a Tag sequence such as GST may be added thereto for the purpose of improving the expression or purification efficiency of the molecule of interest. The Fc-containing molecule used in the present invention has a N297 glycan and the N297 glycan is remodeled into a SG type glycan having any of structures given below (SG type N297 glycan) from heterogeneous glycans originally attached to Asn297 of the Fc-containing molecule by posttranslational modification in the course of production using animal cells. Usually, glycans are attached to Asn297 residues in both the monomers of a dimer during production from animal cells to produce a normal form having two N297 glycan moieties per dimeric Fc-containing molecule. However, depending on production conditions or the structure of the Fc-containing molecule, a glycan deletion mutant in which a N297 glycan is attached to only one of the monomers (molecule having one N297 glycan moiety per dimeric Fc-containing molecule) may be produced at a given rate. Even such a Fc-containing molecule comprising a glycan deletion mutant can be used in the present invention. 


 wherein [L(PEG)] represents L(PEG) being bound to carbonyl groups bonded to the 2-positions of sialic acid residues at the non-reducing ends of both the 1-3 and 1-6 branched chains of β-Man. 


 wherein [L(PEG)] represents L(PEG) being bound to a carbonyl group bonded to the 2-position of a sialic acid residue at the non-reducing end of the 1-3 branched chain of β-Man. 


 wherein [L(PEG)] represents L(PEG) being bound to a carbonyl group bonded to the 2-position of a sialic acid residue at the non-reducing end of the 1-6 branched chain of β-Man. When the N297 glycan in the conjugate of the present invention is N297-(Fuc)MSG1 or N297-(Fuc)MSG2, the conjugate is a molecule having two PEG linker moieties and two hANP peptide moieties bonded thereto (divalent hANP peptide) because the Fc-containing molecule is a dimer usually having the N297 glycan in both the monomers (when the Fc-containing molecule is a glycan deletion mutant, N297-(Fuc)MSG1 or N297-(Fuc)MSG2 is attached to only one of the monomers to form a monovalent hANP peptide). On the other hand, when the N297 glycan is N297-(Fuc)SG, the conjugate is a molecule having four PEG linker moieties and four hANP peptide moieties bonded thereto (tetravalent hANP peptide) because the Fc-containing molecule is a dimer (when the Fc-containing molecule is a glycan deletion mutant, N297-(Fuc) SG is attached to only one of the monomers to form a conjugate with a divalent hANP peptide). The “conjugate” of the present invention may represent a molecule having these plural types of N297 glycans, or a mixture of molecules which are these normal forms together with molecules which are glycan deletion mutants (in the present invention, such a mixture is indicated as a conjugate in a normal form for the sake of convenience), or may be a molecule having a N297 glycan having any one structure. The conjugate of the present invention is preferably a molecule having a SG type N297 glycan having any one structure, more preferably conjugate having N297-(Fuc)SG as the N297 glycan and having a tetravalent hANP peptide (or a divalent hANP peptide for a glycan deletion mutant). In these glycan structures, fucosylated GlcNAc (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc) at the reducing end is derived from the Fc-containing molecule produced in an animal cell and thereby remodels a glycan on the non-reducing end side into a glycan structure similar to that of SG mentioned above. In any case, the glycan is bonded to the PEG linker through the use of carboxylic acid bonded to the 2-position of sialic acid at the non-reducing end. Such a Fc-containing molecule having the SG type N297 glycan can be produced by a method as shown in FIG. 3 in accordance with a method described in, for example, WO2013/120066. When the Fc-containing molecule is produced as a recombinant protein using animal cells in accordance with a known method, the N297 glycan has a fucosylated N-linked glycan structure as a basic structure. In this case, the Fc-containing molecule is obtained as a mixture of antibodies or fragments thereof having glycans having various structures where structures at non-reducing ends or constituent sugars are diversely modified (molecule (IV) of FIG. 3A). Such a Fc-containing molecule produced in an animal cell is treated with hydrolase such as EndoS so that the glycosidic bond between GlcNAcβ1 and 4GlcNAc of a chitobiose structure at the reducing end is hydrolyzed to obtain a Fc-containing molecule having a single glycan structure having only (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc as the N297 glycan (this Fc-containing molecule is referred to as a “(Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-Fc-containing molecule”; see FIG. 2A) (FIG. 3A). For example, EndoS or a mutant enzyme thereof that maintains hydrolyzing activity can be used as such an enzyme for use in the hydrolysis reaction of the N297 glycan. The (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-Fc-containing molecule obtained by the hydrolysis reaction can be reacted as a glycan acceptor molecule with a SG type glycan donor molecule by use of endoglycosidase such as an EndoS D233Q mutant to obtain a Fc-containing molecule having a SG type N297 glycan having the structure mentioned above (see FIG. 2B) (FIG. 3B). When the compound of interest is a conjugate having a tetravalent hANP peptide, a glycan donor molecule having SG(10) as a glycan is used in a transglycosylation reaction thereof. Such a SG(10) glycan used may be obtained by hydrolysis or the like from, for example, SGP or may be a SG(10) glycan alone such as a commercially available disialooctasaccharide (Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.). When the compound of interest is a conjugate having a divalent hANP peptide, a glycan donor molecule having MSG1(9) or MSG2(9) as a glycan is adopted. Such a glycan may be used by separation in accordance with a method described in Example 1-11 using commercially available monosialo-Asn free (1S2G/1G2S-10NC-Asn, GlyTech, Inc.) as a starting material, or may be used as a mixture without separation. GlcNAc at the reducing end of the SG type glycan contained in the donor molecule is preferably used after being activated, for example, in the form of oxazoline by treatment with 2-chloro-1,3-dimethyl-1H-benzimidazol-3-ium-chloride, but does not have to be activated in the case of using two types of enzymes, as mentioned later, at the same time. The SG type glycan contained in the donor molecule has a glycan with a PEG linker or a linker molecule having a partial structure thereof, bonded to carboxylic acid contained in sialic acid at the non-reducing end. Various enzymes can be adopted as such an enzyme for use in the transglycosylation reaction as long as the enzyme has activity of transferring a complex glycan to the N297 glycan. EndoS D233Q is preferred which is an engineered form of EndoS that exhibits suppressed hydrolysis reactivity by the replacement of Asp at position 233 with Gln. The transglycosylation reaction using EndoS D233Q is described in WO2013/120066, etc. Alternatively, an engineered enzyme such as a further mutant of EndoS D233Q, i.e., EndoS D233Q/Q303L, EndoS D233Q/E350A, EndoS D233Q/E350Q, EndoS D233Q/E350D, EndoS D233Q/E350N, or EndoS D233Q/D405A may be utilized. A transglycosylation reaction using such an engineered form of EndoS D233Q is described in WO2017/010559. The purification operation of the Fc-containing molecule after the glycan remodeling (sugar hydrolysis and transglycosylation reaction) of the Fc-containing molecule is aimed at separating the Fc-containing molecule from low-molecular weight compounds and the enzymes used in the reaction. Such purification usually employs gel filtration chromatography, ion exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography, or the like. The addition of further purification using a hydroxyapatite column was confirmed to improve transglycosylation reaction efficiency. Specifically, the present invention provides a method for producing the conjugate, further comprising a purification step using a hydroxyapatite column in the step of purifying an intermediate from a reaction solution after sugar hydrolysis of the Fc-containing molecule. According to reported cases of glycan remodeling (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2012, 134, 12308-12318; and Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2016, 55, 2361-2367), a reaction solution of a Fc-containing molecule treated with hydrolase is merely purified using a protein A column (affinity chromatography column). However, this purification method was found to fail to remove hydrolase (EndoS) completely and to influence the subsequent transglycosylation reaction due to the influence of the residual enzyme. As a result of studying the purification method herein, the reaction solution of the Fc-containing molecule treated with hydrolase was purified using a protein A column and a hydroxyapatite column (CHT column, Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.) in this order to thereby improve the reaction efficiency of the subsequent transglycosylation reaction without being influenced by the residual enzyme. The present invention also provides a method for directly transglycosylating SGP, (SG-)Asn, or the like having an unactivated reducing end as a glycan donor to the N297 glycan of the Fc-containing molecule by use of two types of enzymes at the same time. Usual transglycosylation reactions require activating the reducing end of the glycan donor. The preparation of such an active donor is time consuming and costly. The method of the present invention can directly employ a naturally obtainable or commercially available glycopeptide or the like in the transglycosylation reaction and therefore enables efficient glycan remodeling. For the two types of Endo enzymes used, it is important to combine properly enzyme A (EndoM-like enzyme) for a wide range of complex glycans as substrates and enzyme B (EndoS-like enzyme) for the N297 glycan of the Fc-containing molecule as a substrate. Examples of enzyme A can include EndoM, EndoOm, and EndoCC, and EndoM mutants, EndoOm mutants, and EndoCC mutants that exhibit reduced hydrolyzing activity. Enzyme A is preferably EndoM N175Q, EndoCC N180H, or EndoOm N194Q. Examples of enzyme B can include EndoS and EndoS2 (EndoS49), and EndoS mutants and EndoS2 (EndoS49) mutants that exhibit reduced hydrolyzing activity. Enzyme B is preferably EndoS D233Q, EndoS D233Q/Q303L, EndoS D233Q/E350A, EndoS D233Q/E350Q, EndoS D233Q/E350D, EndoS D233Q/E350N, EndoS D233Q/D405A, or the like. The structure of the glycan donor is not particularly limited as long as the glycan donor has a glycan structure that is recognized by the enzyme A which is adopted. Various molecules, such as naturally obtained molecules and molecules synthesizable in a chemical reaction or enzymatic reaction, can be used. Any substituent other than R═H may be used as substituent R at the anomer site. In the case of a N-linked glycan structure (see the formulas given below; substituent R of the anomer is R at the reducing end of the uppermost structural formula), examples thereof can include amide structures and azide. 


 In the case of an O-linked glycan structure (see the formulas given below; substituent R of the anomer is R at the reducing end of the uppermost structural formula), examples thereof can include ethylene glycol structures, glycolic acid structures, and a benzyl group, an allyl group, and a p-nitrophenyl group for use as protective groups for the anomer hydroxy group. The structure at the non-reducing end of the glycan donor is not particularly limited as long as the structure is recognized by enzyme A. Various structures can be used such as natural glycan structures, non-reducing end glycan deletion mutants of natural glycan structures, structures where an arbitrary hydroxy group is modified with phosphoric acid, and structures chemically bonded to a linker structure. The glycan donor is preferably SGP, (SG-)Asn, ([N3-PEG(3)]2-SG)-Asn-PEG(3)-N3, or the like. 





 The acceptor molecule for use in the method of the present invention is not particularly limited as long as the acceptor molecule is a Fc-containing molecule having the N297 glycan. Various types such as mAb, CLCH, and Fc fragments can be appropriately selected and used. The reaction temperature can be appropriately selected according to the optimum temperatures of the enzymes used and is usually 15 to 50° C., preferably 25 to 40° C. In the method of the present invention, which employs two types of enzymes, the transfer reaction may not properly proceed if one of the enzymes is deactivated at the optimum temperature of the other enzyme. Therefore, it is preferred to select a combination of enzymes similar in conditions such as the optimum reaction temperature. <Peg Linker> In the present invention, the PEG linker means a chemical structure that comprises a polyethylene glycol structure and mediates the linkage of the hANP peptide to the Fc-containing molecule in the conjugate of the present invention. The PEG linker structure usually consists of a linear structure free from any branched structure and binds at one end to the N terminal amino group or the C terminal carboxyl group of the hANP peptide and at the other end to carboxylic acid at the 2-position of sialic acid in the N297 glycan of the Fc-containing molecule. The PEG linker contained in the conjugate of the present invention comprises approximately 10 or more ethylene glycol units in a linear form. This length is important for maintaining the activity of hANP exhibited by the conjugate. The upper limit of the number of ethylene glycol units (—CH2-CH2-O—) contained in the linker structure is approximately 50 or fewer, preferably approximately 40 or fewer, more preferably approximately 35 or fewer, even more preferably approximately 30 or fewer. The lower limit of the number of ethylene glycol units contained in the linker structure is preferably approximately 15 or more, more preferably approximately 20 or more, even more preferably approximately 25 or more. Such a PEG linker may be derived from a single molecule or may consist of a plurality of partial structures where a plurality of molecules are bonded to each other. Such a molecule serving as a source of the linker structure is referred to as a “linker molecule”. When the PEG linker of the present invention is derived from one linker molecule, it is preferred to select a functional group contained in the linker molecule such that the PEG linker binds to the N terminus of the hANP peptide, for binding to carboxylic acid at the 2-position of sialic acid in the SG type N297 glycan of the Fc-containing molecule, and for securing the homogeneous structure of the conjugate. When the PEG linker of the present invention is derived from a plurality of linker molecules, at least a compound containing a functional group binding to carboxylic acid at the 2-position of sialic acid in the N297 glycan, and a compound having a functional group capable of binding to the N terminus or C terminus of the hANP peptide are used as the linker molecules. These two types of linker molecules may be directly bonded to each other when they also have a functional group that permits their direct binding, or may be linked by the medium of an additional compound. Each linker molecule used is appropriately selected as a compound having a proper functional group or structure, in consideration of conjugate production efficiency or convenience. Therefore, only one type of linker molecule may comprise PEG, or two or more linker molecules may comprise ethylene glycol units, as long as the finally constructed PEG linker structure comprises a predetermined number of ethylene glycol unit structures in total. In the linker structure represented by “PEG(n)”, n represents the number of consecutive ethylene glycol units contained therein. A linker structure having an insert of another chemical structure is represented by PEG(n)-PEG(m). For example, a linker structure comprising polyethylene glycol of 24 units is referred to as PEG(24), and a linker structure formed by the binding between a linker molecule comprising polyethylene glycol of 12 units and a linker molecule comprising polyethylene glycol of 6 units is referred to as PEG(12)-PEG(6). For example, the PEG(12)-PEG(12) moiety formed by the binding between identical linker molecules may also be simply referred to as PEG(12)2. Such a PEG linker having the desired length can be formed as a linker having the desired PEG length, for example, by repeating deprotection and carboxylic acid activation using a Fmoc-PEG reagent, such as 3-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-[2-(9H-fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonylamino)ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]ethoxy]propanoic acid (Fmoc-PEG(12)-COOH), which has a Fmoc-protected amino group on one side and has carboxylic acid on the other side. Such a Fmoc-PEG reagent is commercially available as Fmoc-PEG(3)-COOH, Fmoc-PEG(6)-COOH, Fmoc-PEG(12)-COOH, Fmoc-PEG(24)-COOH, or the like from Novabiochem/Merck KGaA. Various methods known in the field of organic synthetic chemistry can be applied to the binding between such linker molecules, without particular limitations. In general, this binding can be carried out with reference to a conjugation method applicable to antibody-drug conjugate synthesis (Bioconjugate Chem. 2015, 26, 2198-2215). Examples of a method for forming a ring through the Huisgen reaction of an azide group with an acetylene group can include a cycloaddition reaction to form a 1,2,3-triazole ring [Cu(I)-catalyzed azide-alkyne 1498711133922_0 (CuAAC)] and a cycloaddition reaction to form a 1,2,3-triazole ring from an azide group and dibenzylcyclooctene (DBCO) [strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPARC)]. In this context, other compounds such as a compound having a twisted cyclooctyne structure, bicyclo[6.1.0]non-4-ene (BCN) (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2010, 49, 9422-9425), and a cycloalkyne containing a heteroatom on a medium ring structure (Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2015, 54, 1190-1194) can also be similarly utilized. Other examples of the ring-forming reaction can include a Diels-Alder cycloaddition reaction of a 1,2,4,5-tetrazine ring with twisted alkene (Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 2014, 21, 89-95). Examples of cyclocondensation based on a Pictet-Spengler reaction with an aldehyde group can include Hydrazino-Pictet-Spengler ligation (Bioconjugate Chem. 24, 846-851) and Oxyamin-based Pictet-Spengler ligation (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 110, 46-51). Additional examples thereof can include an amide bond between an amino group and a carboxyl group, maleimide condensation of a SH group with a maleimide group, condensation of a SH group with a methylsulfonylphenyloxadiazole group (Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 52, 12592-6), a bond between a SH group and an iodoacetyl group, a disulfide bond by condensation of a SH group with a 2-pyridyldithio group, hydrazone condensation of an aldehyde group with hydrazide, and oxime condensation of an aldehyde group with an aminooxy group. The linker molecule adopted in the present invention can be appropriately selected as a molecule having a functional group conforming to any of these binding patterns and used for the formation of the linker structure. Such a binding reaction may form stereoisomers, optical isomers, geometric isomers, or the like, depending on the binding pattern. These isomers may be resolved by known methods or may be used as a mixture. Since the final conjugate is a macromolecule, the structural difference between the isomers of these partial structures is considered rarely to influence the conjugate. Specific examples of such a PEG linker can include structures such as the following L(PEG) A1 to L(PEG) H1 and L(PEG) A2 to L(PEG) H2. 














 wherein “hANP” represents binding to the N terminus of the hANP peptide, and “N297 GLY” represents binding to the carbonyl group at the 2-position of sialic acid at the non-reducing end of the N297 glycan. These linker structures have a 1,2,3-triazole ring formed through the Click reaction of an azide group introduced in the N297 glycan bonded to the Fc-containing molecule with a DBCO group bonded to the linker molecule comprising the hANP peptide. In this structure, geometric isomers are formed in which the linker structure bonded to the azide group is bonded to the 1- or 3-position of the triazole ring. Since the reaction occurs with two or four azide groups per Fc-containing molecule, geometric isomeric structures coexist in one molecule of the conjugate. <Conjugate and Method for Producing Same> The conjugate of the present invention can be produced by appropriately conjugating the intermediates such as the hANP peptide, the Fc-containing molecule, and the linker molecule mentioned above through the use of reactions known in the field of organic synthetic chemistry. The order of production thereof is not particularly limited, and various methods can be adopted by a common method according to the structures of the intermediates and the compound of interest. The functional group carried by each intermediate is appropriately activated, inactivated, protected with a protective group, and deprotected, for example, by common methods according to the production steps. The intermediate or the final product in each reaction step is appropriately separated and purified and subjected to the next reaction or utilized as a bulk pharmaceutical or a reagent. The conjugate having any of the PEG linkers listed above can be produced, for example, as follows. The linker molecule bonded to the N297 glycan is a molecule having a functional group (e.g., an azide group) at the non-reducing end of the N297 glycan and is synthesized by the glycan remodeling step for the Fc-containing molecule mentioned above. A linker molecule having an amino group on one side and another functional group (e.g., an azide group) on the other side is reacted with SG(10) to bond the linker molecule to carboxylic acid at the 2-position of sialic acid at the non-reducing end of the glycan. Subsequently, GlcNAc at the reducing end of this glycan molecule is activated to prepare a glycan donor molecule, which is then reacted with a (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-Fc-containing molecule in the presence of endoglycosidase to introduce the functional group to the non-reducing end of the N297 glycan in the Fc-containing molecule. The linker molecule bonded to the N terminus of the hANP peptide is a molecule having a carboxyl group on one side and another functional group (DBCO, a protective group-introduced amino group, etc.) on the other side. The hANP peptide can be reacted with the linker molecule to introduce the desired functional group to the N terminus of the hANP peptide. The functional group-introduced Fc-containing molecule and hANP peptide thus obtained can be linked to each other directly or via another linker molecule to obtain the conjugate of the present invention. Examples of the conjugate of the present invention can specifically include L(PEG)-A to L(PEG)-H described above in which the hANP peptide is hANP(1-28) or (SG-) Asn-hANP(1-28), the Fc-containing molecule is an antibody consisting of a combination of a heavy chain consisting of an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 20 to 474 of SEQ ID NO: 3 and a light chain consisting of an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 21 to 234 of SEQ ID NO: 5 (mAb-A), or CLCH consisting of a combination of a heavy chain consisting of an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 20 to 349 of SEQ ID NO: 7 and a light chain consisting of an amino acid sequence from amino acid positions 21 to 125 of SEQ ID NO: 9 (CLCH-A), and the SG type N297 glycan is N297-(Fuc)SG or N297-(Fuc)MSG1, and can more specifically include compound 3-1 to compound 3-14 synthesized in Example 3. Compound 3-1 to compound 3-6 are preferred. <Function and Activity> The conjugate of the present invention exhibits a prolonged duration time in the blood and excellent physical properties as compared with unmodified hANP(1-28) and has the ability to migrate into the blood gradually, which is preferred for a hANP formulation, when subcutaneously administered. Native hANP(1-28) disappears rapidly from blood and therefore needs to be continuously administered by intravenous infusion or the like in clinical practice. By contrast, the conjugate of the present invention can exert a pharmacological effect for a long period even by usual subcutaneous administration. Furthermore, the conjugate of the present invention has the property of low aggregation even at a high concentration. Such characteristics of the conjugate of the present invention allow for adoption of administration methods, administration routes, and formulation techniques, which cannot be attained by conventional native hANP or existing hANP formulations, and also enable the conjugate to be used in the treatment of acute cardiovascular diseases as well as chronic cardiovascular diseases (hypertension, chronic heart diseases, etc.). Moreover, the conjugate of the present invention is also useful as a biological research tool. It is unclear how or whether native hANP migrates to a tissue, for example, when residing in the blood for a long period. By contrast, such localization or the influence of the long-term residence of hANP in the blood on living bodies can be examined by the administration of the conjugate of the present invention. The duration time in the blood of the conjugate of the present invention can be tested in accordance with the method of Example 4-2 by administering the conjugate to an animal and then detecting a cGMP concentration in peripheral blood and/or the conjugate contained in a peripheral blood sample. The conjugate of the present invention maintains the effect of elevating the cGMP concentration in peripheral blood even approximately 24 hours after intracorporeal administration, more preferably maintains this effect even approximately 48 hours after the administration, even more preferably maintains this effect even approximately 72 hours after the administration, and further preferably maintains this effect even approximately 96, 120, 144 or 168 hours after the administration. Furthermore, the conjugate of the present invention gradually exhibits its activity after subcutaneous administration, and the activity often reaches a peak 24 to 48 hours later. Such kinetics in the blood are expected to be able to reduce or circumvent the risk of manifesting hypotension. As for the detection of the conjugate in peripheral blood after the administration of the conjugate, this conjugate is preferably detected even approximately 24 hours later, more preferably detected even approximately 48 hours later, even more preferably detected even approximately 72 hours later, and further preferably detected even approximately 96, 120, 144 or 168 hours later. The conjugate of the present invention exhibits an excellent physical property of rarely aggregating even in an aqueous solution having a high concentration. The hANP peptide is prone to gelation due to the influence of a salt in a solution, etc. Thus, its formulation needs to be handled with caution. The conjugate of the present invention reduces problems associated with agglutination and can be applied to various forms of formulations in such a way that the concentration of the active ingredient is increased, or various additives can be adopted. Particularly, the conjugate comprising a glycosylated hANP peptide has been confirmed to exhibit very favorable non-agglutination. The duration time of the conjugate of the present invention in the blood can be measured by administering the conjugate to an organism, sampling blood at certain intervals of time, and detecting the conjugate contained in the blood samples. Various methods, for example, detection by LC-MS and ELISA using an antibody specifically recognizing the ring structure of hANP, can be used as methods for detecting the conjugate. In the case of administering the conjugate of the present invention at a dose that produces its cGMP elevating activity, the cGMP levels of the blood samples can be measured using a commercially available measurement kit and compared with the cGMP level in the blood determined before the start of the administration to measure the duration time of the biological activity of the conjugate in blood. Alternatively, the conjugate may be labeled with a radioisotope and detected by separating the blood samples by SDS-PAGE or the like and detecting the radioactive signals. In the present invention, “prolonged duration time in the blood” means that the time for which a test substance is detectable in the blood after administration is prolonged as compared with native hANP. Native hANP subcutaneously administered to a monkey has a concentration in the blood equal to or lower than the measurement limit at 30 minutes after the administration at 200 nmol/kg (data not shown), whereas the conjugate was detected from blood even 7 days after administration at 100 nmol/kg. The conjugate of the present invention also has resistance to the degradation of the hANP peptide by NEP. This is probably responsible in part for the prolonged duration time. Such resistance to NEP degradation can be measured by known methods. The cGMP elevating activity of the conjugate of the present invention is measured by stimulating GC-A receptor-expressing cells with a test substance adjusted to a concentration gradient up to a sufficient amount, then lysing the cells, measuring cGMP concentrations in the cell lysates, and identifying the maximum cGMP concentration (Emax). The phrase “maintaining cGMP elevating activity” described for the conjugate of the present invention means that the maximum cGMP concentration exhibited by the conjugate is approximately 30% or more compared with the maximum cGMP concentration of native hANP. The maximum cGMP concentration exhibited by the conjugate is preferably approximately 50% or more, more preferably approximately 70% or more. The conjugate of the present invention can be formulated at a high concentration as compared with native hANP and exhibits a prolonged duration time in blood. Therefore, it is not appropriate to define the activity of the conjugate of the present invention on the basis of an index such as a so-called EC50 value. Provided that the maximum activity of a conjugate at the elevated concentration can be equal to or greater than the given activity of native hANP, the conjugate can produce sufficient drug efficacy when administered continuously and/or at a high concentration in clinical practice. The present invention provides a medicament comprising the conjugate of the present invention as an active ingredient. <Medicament> The substance that may be used as an active ingredient for the medicament according to the present invention may be a pharmaceutically acceptable salt of the conjugate mentioned above. Specifically, in the present invention, an acid (an inorganic acid, for example, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid, or an organic acid, for example, formic acid, acetic acid, butyric acid, trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), succinic acid, or citric acid)-addition salt of the substance mentioned above may be used as the active ingredient. Alternatively, in the present invention, a metal (e.g., sodium, potassium, lithium, or calcium) salt of the substance mentioned above or a salt form based on an organic base thereof may be used as the active ingredient. Such a salt of the conjugate of the present invention may be a salt based on the hANP peptide moiety or may be a salt formed in the structure of the glycan. The salt of the conjugate of the present invention is preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable salt formed at the hANP peptide moiety. The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention may contain a free form of the substance related to the active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. The substance that may be used as an active ingredient for the medicament according to the present invention, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is preferably mixed with a known pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, excipient, diluent, or the like and administered to an individual by an administration method that is generally used for medicaments, i.e., an oral administration method or a parenteral administration method such as transmucosal administration, intravenous administration, intramuscular administration, or subcutaneous administration. The dose of the substance that may be used as an active ingredient for the medicament according to the present invention differs depending on the type of disease, the age, body weight, and severity of a condition of the individual (patient), and the administration route, etc. In general, the upper limit of the daily dose is, for example, approximately 100 mg/kg or lower, preferably approximately 50 mg/kg or lower, more preferably 1 mg/kg or lower. The lower limit of the daily dose is, for example, approximately 0.1 μg/kg or higher, preferably 0.5 μg/kg or higher, more preferably 1 μg/kg or higher. The dosing frequency of the medicament according to the present invention varies depending on the active ingredient used, the administration route, and the particular disease to be treated. In the case of orally administering, for example, a peptidic substance, this substance is preferably prescribed such that the number of doses per day is 4 or fewer. In the case of parenteral administration, for example, intravenous administration, the medicament may be injected using a normal syringe or may be continuously administered through the use of an infusion pump, a catheter, or the like. Alternatively, administration through a route such as subcutaneous injection or intramuscular injection is also preferred. In this case, various administration devices that are usually used can be adopted. When the active ingredient for the medicament of the present invention is prepared in a solution, the conjugate of the present invention or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof can be dissolved in an aqueous solvent and supplemented, if necessary, with a stabilizer, a pH adjuster, a surfactant, and the like to prepare the solution. In the case of preparing a freeze-dried formulation, the solution thus prepared can be freeze-dried and dissolved in physiological saline, injectable water, a glucose solution, or the like in use. The medicament of the present invention is administered to a patient with a disease treatable by the activation of GC-A and the resulting elevation of the cGMP level, and is thereby effective for treating this disease. In this context, the “treatment” of the disease or its symptoms means that the progression of a pathological condition expected to be normalized by the activation of GC-A is delayed, alleviated, reduced, and/or suppressed, thereby making the condition closer to a normal state. The medicament of the present invention is expected to be effective for preventing the aggravation or onset of a disease by starting its administration at an early stage of the disease or by administering to an individual at a high risk of the disease. Although a patient who has developed the disease in the past is at risk of recurrence or chronicity, the medicament of the present invention can be expected to reduce the risk of recurrence or chronicity by continuous administration to such a patient. These effects are also included in the scope of the treatment. Examples of such a disease include hypertension, acute heart failure (including the management of a medical condition after the onset of acute heart failure), chronic heart failure, ischemic heart diseases, acute nephritis (including the management of a medical condition after the onset of acute nephritis), chronic nephritis, acute renal failure (including the management of a medical condition after the onset of acute renal failure), chronic renal failure, ischemic heart diseases (myocardial infarction, etc.), metastasis of malignant tumor, hepatic fibrosis, hepatic cirrhosis, tissue adhesion caused by dialysis, and fibrosis.

Flow rate: 40 mL/min (10 mL/min during sample addition)
 The obtained solution was filtered through a 0.45 μm PVDF filter, divided into two portions (approximately 80 mL each), and purified in the two portions by the following operation: for binding to the column, the reaction solution was added to the upper part of the column, and a binding buffer (20 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0)) was injected into the column in 5 CV at 10 ml/min and further injected thereinto in 5 CV at 40 ml/min. For intermediate washing, a washing solution (20 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) and 0.5 M sodium chloride solution) was injected into the column in 10 CV. For elution, an elution buffer (ImmunoPure IgG Elution buffer, manufactured by Pierce/Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) was injected into the column in 6 CV. The eluate was immediately neutralized with a 1 M Tris buffer solution (pH 9.0). Fractions detected by UV (280 nm) during elution were confirmed using, according to need, a micro volume spectrophotometer Xpose (manufactured by Trinean NV) and hydrophobic interaction chromatography. All fractions containing the compound of interest from the two portions were combined, then concentrated into approximately 40 mL using an ultrafiltration apparatus (Cogent μScale TFF System) equipped with ultrafiltration membranes (Pellicon XL50 Cassette Ultracel 10 kDa (two membranes were used)), and then buffer-replaced with a 5% sorbitol/10 mM acetate buffer solution (pH 5.5).

 Two columns were connected, and the solution obtained in the preceding step (1) was divided into three portions and purified in the three portions by the following method: the solution was added to the upper part of the column, and solution A (5 mM phosphate buffer solution and 50 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) solution (pH 6.5)) was injected into the column in 2 CV at 1.25 ml/min and further injected thereinto in 3 CV at 5 ml/min. Then, elution was performed using solution A and solution B (5 mM phosphate buffer solution, 50 mM 2-morpholinoethanesulfonic acid (MES) solution (pH 6.5), and 2 M sodium chloride solution). The elution conditions involved solution A:solution B=100:0 to 0:100 (15 CV). Further, a washing solution (500 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.5)) was injected into the column in 5 CV. Fractions detected by UV (280 nm) during elution were confirmed using, according to need, a micro volume spectrophotometer Xpose (manufactured by Trinean NV) and an Experion electrophoresis station (manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). All fractions containing the compound of interest from the three portions were combined, then concentrated using VIVASPIN 20 (10,000 MWCO, manufactured by Sartorius AG), and buffer-replaced with a 50 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0) to obtain 7.17 mg/ml of a (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-Fc-B solution (50 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0)) (35.4 ml).

To this reaction solution, the [N3-PEG(3)]2-SG(10)-Ox (6.1 mg) solution (50 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0)) (0.10 ml) synthesized in Example 1-10 was further added, and the mixture was incubated at 30° C. for 0.5 hours. The operation described above was performed for 5 lots. The degree of progression of the reaction was confirmed using an Experion electrophoresis station (manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). After completion of the reaction, the binding buffer used in the purification by affinity chromatography was changed from the 20 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 7.0) to a 20 mM phosphate buffer solution (pH 6.0), and purification by affinity chromatography and purification by hydroxyapatite chromatography were performed according to the same method as in step (3-10A). The portions obtained in the division operation were combined, and all fractions containing the compound of interest were concentrated using VIVASPIN 20 (10,000 MWCO, manufactured by Sartorius AG) and then buffer-replaced with a 5% sorbitol/10 mM acetate buffer solution (pH 5.5) using NAP25 (manufactured by GE Healthcare Japan Corp.) to obtain 13.06 mg/mL of a Fc-B-[PEG(3)-N3]4 solution (5% sorbitol/10 mM acetate buffer solution (pH 5.5)) (13.7 ml).

Finally, the solution was filtered through a filter (Millex-GV, 0.22 μm, PVDF, already sterilized, manufactured by Merck Millipore/Merck KGaA) to obtain 13.03 mg/ml of a Fc-A-[PEG(3)//PEG(12)2-hANP(1-28)]4 solution (5% sorbitol/10 mM acetate buffer solution (pH 5.5)) (13.6 ml). calculated for the chain of Fc-B-[PEG(3)//PEG(12)2-hANP(1-28)]4(-Lys), M=41469.4; found 41467.9 (deconvolution data). Results of analyzing the conjugate by mass spectrometry without fragmentation will be given below. calculated for Fc-B-[PEG(3)//PEG(12)2-hANP(1-28)]4(-Lys), M=82918.8; found 82917.0 (deconvolution data). calculated for Fc-B-[PEG(3)//PEG(12)2-hANP(1-28)]2(-Lys), M=66391.7; found 66390.8 (deconvolution data). [Example 4] Evaluation of Various Conjugates <Example 4-1> Test on cGMP Elevating Activity of Conjugate The cGMP elevating activity of compounds 3-1 to 3-6 prepared in Example 3 was measured by the following method. CHO/human GC-A cells, which were CHO cells caused to express human GC-A constitutively, were suspended at 2×105 cells/ml in α-MEM, 10% FBS, and 1% penicillin-streptomycin, inoculated at 20 μl/well (4×103 cells/well) onto a 384-well plate (manufactured by Corning Inc., 3826), and cultured overnight in a CO2 incubator. On the next day, the medium was removed from this plate, and then, a 1.6 mM IBMX/KRB buffer was added thereto at 10 to 15 μl/well. The plate was stirred on a plate shaker and then incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes. Subsequently, a test substance dissolved in 0.1% BSA/PBS (dilution series were prepared such that the final concentration of each conjugate or native hANP(1-28) was 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 nM) was added thereto at 5 μl/well. The plate was stirred on a plate shaker and then incubated for 15 minutes in a CO2 incubator. Then, the cGMP level in each well was measured using a cGMP kit (manufactured by Cisbio Bioassays) according to the attached protocol. The activity value (T/C) of the test substance at each concentration was corrected when the measurement value of a well supplemented with only a solvent was defined as 0 and the measurement value of a well supplemented with 1 nM native hANP was defined as 1. On the basis of this correction, the specific activity (EC50 value of the test substance/EC50 value of native hANP) and Emax (the maximum activity value of the test substance in the concentration range) of each test substance were calculated (Table 2). As seen from the results of Table 2, all the conjugates exhibited cGMP elevating activity. Also, the conjugates had Emax almost equivalent to native hANP. The glycosylated hANP-mAb-A conjugate (compound 3-2) was confirmed to have weaker specific activity than that of the hANP-mAb-A conjugate (compound 3-1). Also, the glycosylated hANP-CLCH-A conjugate (compound 3-4) was confirmed to have weaker specific activity than that of the hANP-CLCH-A conjugate (compound 3-3). This suggested that the introduction of a glycan to a hANP peptide tends to reduce in vitro activity. The specific activity of the glycosylated hANP-mAb-A conjugate (compound 3-5) having two hANP peptide moieties was attenuated by 4.5 times as compared with the glycosylated hANP-mAb-A conjugate (compound 3-2) having four hANP peptide moieties. Also, the specific activity of the glycosylated hANP-CLCH-A conjugate (compound 3-6) having two hANP peptide moieties was attenuated by 3.2 times as compared with the glycosylated hANP-CLCH-A conjugate (compound 3-4) having four hANP peptide moieties. This suggested that a conjugate having a larger number of hANP peptide moieties tends to exhibit more favorable activity. All of compound 3-15 exploiting CLCH-B (LALA form of CLCH) as a carrier molecule, compound 3-16 exploiting Fc-A (LALA form of the Fc fragment) thereas, and compound 3-17 exploiting Fc-B (wild type Fc fragment) thereas exhibited in vitro activity at the same level as for native hANP.

 <Test Example 4-2> Test on Duration of Conjugate in Blood of Rat The duration (the effect of sustainably elevating cGMP in blood and the time for which a test substance was detectable in blood) of each conjugate prepared in Example 3 in the blood of rats was examined by the following method. (1) Preparation of Plasma Sample Isoflurane: Japanese pharmacopoeia isoflurane

Needle and syringe for blood collection: Terumo Syringe 25G×1 SR for Tuberculin

Tube for blood collection: CAPIJECT Micro Collection Tube EDTA-2Na 500 μL

Tube for sample storage: MATRIX 4170 Sample Tracking Tube 0.75 mL
 Each 8- to 9-week-old male Slc:SD rat was subjected to isoflurane inhalation anesthesia (inhalation of an Escain inhalation anesthetic kept at a concentration of 1 to 2%). A solution of a test substance (each conjugate: compounds 3-1 to 3-6) diluted with PBS according to need was rapidly subcutaneously administered at a dose of 100 nmol/kg (1 mL/kg) to the rat. At the point in time selected for each compound from before the administration and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120 and 168 hours after the administration, blood was sampled (200 μL/sampling) over time from the jugular vein. The blood samples were immediately left on ice. The collected blood samples were centrifuged at 5000 rpm at 4° C. for 5 minutes using a centrifuge (Sigma 4K15, rotor: Nr12130-H). The separated plasma samples were divided into two types (samples for PK measurement and for cGMP measurement) and preserved at −80° C. until measurement. (2) Measurement of Plasma cGMP Concentration The plasma cGMP concentration was measured for the plasma samples diluted 100-fold using Amersham cGMP Enzyme Immunoassay Biotrak™ (EIA) System (dual range) according to the protocol attached to the kit. Change in the obtained plasma cGMP concentration is shown in FIG. 6. (3) Detection of Test Substance in Plasma Sample 10 μL of each rat plasma sample prepared in paragraph (1) was diluted 10-fold with Rexxip HN Buffer (manufactured Gyros AB) and further appropriately diluted 10-fold (final: 100-fold dilution) with the same buffer as above, or the resulting dilution was further diluted 10-fold with 1% plasma/Rexxip HN Buffer (final: 1000-fold dilution), according to need, to prepare a plasma sample for measurement. The primary antibody used was Goat Anti-Human IgG Biotin conjugate (SouthernBiotech) for the measurement of all human Fc-containing molecules (Fc/Fc) in the samples and Mouse Anti-ANP IgG (GeneTex Inc.) for the measurement of a conjugate (ANP/Fc) with hANP(1-28) bonded thereto in the samples. Each primary antibody was adjusted to 700 nM with 0.1% PBS-T. DyLight-labeled Goat Anti-Human IgG (SouthernBiotech) was adjusted as a secondary antibody for detection to 10 nM with Rexxip F Buffer (Gyros AB) for both the primary antibodies. Each solution was loaded in an automatic ELISA apparatus Gyrolab xP workstation and injected to Bioaffy 200 CD (Gyros AB). The content of the test substance (Fc/Fc and ANP/Fc) was measured by sandwich ELISA to calculate a plasma concentration. Change in the obtained plasma concentration is shown in FIG. 7. From FIGS. 6 and 7, these various conjugates were confirmed to be GC-A activators possessing all of: gradual migration into the blood, long retention in the blood, and long pharmacological effect duration, as compared with native hANP. The following was confirmed from FIG. 6. Compound 3-1, which was a hANP-mAb-A conjugate, exhibited the highest Emax. Also, compound 3-1 exhibited longer pharmacological activity duration than that of compound 3-3 which was a hANP-CLCH-A conjugate. Compound 3-2, which was a glycosylated hANP-mAb-A conjugate, and compound 3-4, which was a glycosylated hANP-CLCH-A conjugate, exhibited slower time to reach Emax and decay rate than did compound 3-1. This probably means that a glycosylated hANP-mAb-A conjugate exhibits longer pharmacological activity duration. Compounds 3-5 and 3-6, which were conjugates having two hANP peptide moieties, exhibited weaker Emax than compounds 3-2 and 3-4 did, which were conjugates having four hANP peptide moieties. This probably means that a glycosylated hANP-mAb-A conjugate having a larger number of hANP peptide moieties exhibits stronger pharmacological activity. The following was confirmed from FIG. 7. The concentrations in blood of the hANP conjugates were confirmed even 168 hours after administration. Compound 3-1 which was a hANP-mAb-A conjugate had a small divergence between Fc/Fc and ANP/Fc, a high plasma concentration 168 hours after administration, and a slow decay rate, as compared with compound 3-3 which was a hANP-CLCH-A conjugate. This indicates that compound 3-1 has longer retention in the blood than that of compound 3-3. Compound 3-2, which was a glycosylated hANP-mAb-A conjugate had a small divergence between Fc/Fc and ANP/Fc, a high plasma concentration 168 hours after administration, and a slow decay rate, as compared with compound 3-1, which was a hANP-mAb-A conjugate. This indicates that compound 3-2 has longer retention in blood than that of compound 3-1. Compound 3-4, which was a glycosylated hANP-CLCH-A conjugate, had a small divergence between Fc/Fc and ANP/Fc, a high plasma concentration 168 hours after administration, and a slow decay rate, as compared with compound 3-3, which was a hANP-CLCH-A conjugate. This indicates that compound 3-4 has longer retention in blood than compound 3-3 does. <Example 4-3> Influence of PEG Linker on cGMP Elevating Activity of Conjugate This experiment was conducted for the purpose of studying the influence of the PEG linker moiety on cGMP elevating activity using the conjugates synthesized in Example 3-7. The specific activity and Emax of native hANP and a test substance were calculated in the same way as the method described in Example 4-1. The results are shown in Table 3. The following was confirmed as to the influence of the length or type of the PEG linker on in vitro activity. All the compounds kept Emax to the same extent as in hANP. The specific activity relative to hANP ranged from 0.41 to 2.84 times. Thus, all the compounds had cGMP elevating activity at a given or higher level. A compound having a larger number of ethylene glycol units contained in the PEG linker tended to exhibit more favorable activity. On the other hand, it was suggested that when linker structures have a nearly equal length as a whole, a compound having a linker structure where a smaller number of linker molecules having long PEG are bonded tends to exhibit more favorable activity than that of a compound having a linker structure where a larger number of linker molecules having short PEG (e.g., PEG(6)) are bonded.

 <Test Example 4-4> Influence of PEG Linker on Duration of Conjugate in Blood of Rat This experiment was conducted for the purpose of studying the influence of the PEG linker moiety on duration in animal blood using the conjugates synthesized in Example 3-7. Time-dependent change in plasma cGMP concentration after subcutaneous administration of a test substance to rats was examined in the same way as the method described in Example 4-2. The results are shown in FIG. 8. The following was confirmed as to the influence of the length or type of the PEG linker on in vitro activity. Compound 3-7 having PEG(12)-PEG(12) had the highest Emax, whereas compound 3-9 having PEG(24) had the weakest activity and short duration, contrary to the in vitro results. <Test Example 4-5> Physical Property Evaluation of Conjugate Native hANP(1-28) is known to be highly agglutinated. For example, when 7 mg/mL solution of native hANP(1-28) in PBS is incubated at 30° C., gel-like deposits are confirmed within 24 hours and the whole solution is confirmed to become a gel within 48 hours. Provided that a test is conducted at almost the same concentration based on the number of moles of hANP contained, the agglutination of a hANP conjugate can be indirectly compared. The following test was conducted for the purpose of confirming the agglutination of the conjugate of the present invention. (1) Accelerated Deterioration Test Each sample was concentrated using Vivapore 5 (manufactured by Vivascience AG), dialyzed against 25 mM AcONa/5% sorbitol, pH 5.5 (ABSor solution) or PBS, and then adjusted to 70 mg/mL. The solution was filtered through a Spin-X 0.22 μm centrifugal filter (manufactured by CoStar Group, Inc.) and dispensed at 80 μL/tube to 0.5 mL sterilized slim tubes (manufactured by Sumitomo Bakelite Co., Ltd.), which were then hermetically sealed and then left standing at 40° C. for 2 weeks. The sample before and after deterioration was measured using SEC-MALS system (manufactured by Wyatt Technology Corp.) constituted by Agilent 1260 LC, DAWN HELEOS 8, and Eclipse 3+, and analyzed using ASTRA software (manufactured by Wyatt Technology Corp.). The measurement was carried out under conditions of column: Nanofilm SEC-250 7.8'300 mm (manufactured by Sepax Technologies, Inc.), buffer: 0.2 M KPi/0.2 M KCl, pH 7.0, flow rate: 0.5 mL/min, column temperature: 30° C., and detection wavelength: 280 nm. The results are shown in Table 4. The whole solution of native hANP in PBS becomes a gel within 48 hours, whereas the conjugates were confirmed to have solution fluidity even 2 weeks later and exhibited improved solution stability. The accelerated deterioration treatment increased a high-molecular-weight form of compound 3-3 from 8.2% to 14.2% in the ABSor solution and from 9.2% to 45.7% in the PBS solution. As for compound 3-4 with a glycan introduced near the hANP site of compound 3-3, the accelerated deterioration treatment increased a high-molecular-weight form from 1.8% to 4.5% in the ABSor solution and from 2.8% to 12.8% in the PBS solution. Accordingly, the introduction of a glycan to near a hANP site was found to reduce agglutination remarkably.

 <Test Example 4-6> Test on Duration of Conjugate in Blood of Monkey The duration of the conjugates differing in their carrier molecule, prepared in Example 3, in the blood of monkeys was examined by examining the time for which a test substance was detectable in blood according to the following method to study the influence of the carrier molecule on the duration in the blood of the conjugates. (1) Preparation of Plasma Sample Needle and syringe for blood collection: Terumo Syringe 25G×1 SR for Tuberculin

Tube for blood collection: CAPIJECT Micro Collection Tube EDTA-2Na or Venoject Vacuum Blood Collecting Vessel EDTA-2Na

Tube for sample storage: MATRIX 4170 Sample Tracking Tube 0.75 mL
 Each 3- to 7-year-old male cynomolgus monkey was subjected to the administration of a test substance and blood collection without anesthesia. A solution of a test substance (each conjugate: compounds 3-2, 3-4, 3-15, 3-16, and 3-17) diluted with PBS according to need was rapidly subcutaneously administered at a dose of 10 nmol/kg (1 mL/kg) to the monkey. At each point in time before administration and 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 24, 48, 96, 168, 336, 528 (or 504), and 696 (or 672) hours after administration, blood was sampled (approximately 500 μL/sampling) over time from the vein. The blood samples were immediately left on ice. The collected blood samples were centrifuged, and the plasma samples thus obtained were preserved at −80° C. until measurement. (2) Detection of Test Substance in Plasma Sample To 10 μL of each monkey plasma sample prepared in paragraph (1), 90 μL of Rexxip HN Buffer (manufactured Gyros AB) was added and then mixed (10-fold diluted sample, MRD: 10), or the resulting dilution was further diluted 10-fold with Rexxip HN Buffer (100-fold diluted sample, MRD: 100) and further diluted 10-fold with 1% plasma/Rexxip HN Buffer (1000-fold diluted sample, MRD: 100) to prepare a plasma sample for measurement. The primary antibody used was Goat Anti-Human IgG Biotin conjugate (SouthernBiotech) for the measurement of all human Fc-containing molecules (Fc/Fc) in the samples and Mouse Anti-ANP IgG (GeneTex Inc.) for the measurement of a conjugate (ANP/Fc) with hANP(1-28) bonded thereto in the samples. Each primary antibody was adjusted to 700 nM with 0.1% PBS-T. DyLight-labeled Goat Anti-Human IgG (SouthernBiotech) was adjusted as a secondary antibody for detection to 10 nM with Rexxip F Buffer (Gyros AB) for both the primary antibodies. Each solution was loaded in an automatic ELISA apparatus Gyrolab xP workstation and injected into Bioaffy 200 CD (Gyros AB). The content of the test substance (Fc/Fc and ANP/Fc) was measured by sandwich ELISA to calculate a plasma concentration. Change in the obtained plasma concentration is shown in FIG. 9. From FIG. 9, the hANP conjugates used in this test were confirmed to have a conjugate concentration in the blood even 672 hours (28 days) after administration, without being degraded. Compounds 3-4 and 3-15 having CLCH-A and CLCH-B, respectively, as a carrier molecule rapidly decayed from the blood, as compared with compound 3-2 having mAb-A as a carrier molecule. On the other hand, compounds 3-16 and 3-17 having Fc-A and Fc-B, respectively, as a carrier molecule decayed more gradually from the blood than compound 3-2. Hence, a glycosylated hANP-Fc conjugate was found to have the longest duration in the blood of monkeys. [Example 5] Transglycosylation Reaction Using Two Types of Endo Enzymes Enzyme A (EndoM-like enzyme) and enzyme B (EndoS-like enzyme) can be properly combined as the two types of Endo enzymes used. Examples of enzyme A can include EndoM, EndoOm, and EndoCC, and EndoM mutants, EndoOm mutants, and EndoCC mutants that exhibit reduced hydrolyzing activity. Examples of enzyme B can include EndoS and EndoS2 (EndoS49), and EndoS mutants and EndoS2 (EndoS49) mutants that exhibit reduced hydrolyzing activity. In the structure of a glycan donor moiety, any substituent other than R═H may be used as substituent R at the anomer site as long as the resulting molecule is synthesizable in a chemical reaction or enzymatic reaction. 


 <Example 5-1> Measurement of Rate of Transglycosylation Using SGP as Glycan Donor Commercially available trastuzumab was used as mAb-C. Trastuzumab (440 mg/vial, manufactured by Genentech Inc.) was prepared into 51.3 mg/ml of a (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-trastuzumab solution (50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4)) (1.65 ml) by use of the method described in Example 3-1. To 51.3 mg/ml of the (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-trastuzumab solution (50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4)) (19.5 μl), a 50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4) (0.5 μl), a SGP (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) (5.82 mg) solution (50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4)) (29.1 μl), 1 U/ml of an EndoM N175Q solution (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) (5.0 μl) and 2.00 mg/ml of an EndoS D233Q solution (PBS) (10.0 μl) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 28° C. for 48 hours. At each point in time of 2 hours, 4 hours, 8 hours, 24 hours and 48 hours after the start of the reaction, a portion of this reaction solution was collected, and the degree of progression of the reaction was measured using an Experion electrophoresis station (manufactured by Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc.). For the measurement, a measurement sample was prepared according to the manual attached to the instrument. In the course of this, the transglycosylation reaction was immediately stopped because of the operation of exposing the collected reaction solution to a solution containing dithiothreitol and heating the reaction solution at 95° C. for 5 minutes. The obtained measurement sample was transferred to Experion Pro260 Chips and measured according to the manual attached to the Experion electrophoresis station. From the obtained chromatogram, an unreacted product and a transglycosylated form were confirmed as separate peaks. The rate of transglycosylation was calculated according to the following expression from the peak area ratio between the unreacted product and the transglycosylated form. 

Rate of transglycosylation(%)=[Peak area of the H chain derived from SG-trastuzumab]/{[Peak area of the H chain derived from (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-trastuzumab+[Peak area of the H chain derived from SG-trastuzumab]}×100
 Similarly, reactions were performed using varying combinations of various Endo enzymes, and the rate of transglycosylation at each point in time of each reaction was calculated (Table 5). <Example 5-2> Measurement of Rate of Transglycosylation Using SG-Asn as Glycan Donor To 51.3 mg/ml of the (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-trastuzumab solution (50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4)) (19.5 μl), a 50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4) (0.5 μl), a SG-Asn ammonium salt (4.74 mg) solution (50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4)) (23.7 μl), a 1 U/ml of EndoM N175Q solution (5.0 μl) and 2.00 mg/ml of an EndoS D233Q solution (PBS) (10.0 μl) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 28° C. for 48 hours. The subsequent procedures were performed in the same way as in Example 5-1 to calculate the rate of transglycosylation at each point in time of a reaction (Table 5). <Example 5-3> Measurement of Rate of Transglycosylation Using EndoCC as Enzyme a To 51.3 mg/ml of the (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-trastuzumab solution (50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4)) (19.5 μl), a 50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4) (0.5 μl), a SGP (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) (5.82 mg) solution (50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4)) (29.1 μl), a 1.16 U/ml of an EndoCC solution or 2.21 U/ml of an EndoCC N180H solution (Fushimi Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.) (15.0 μl) and 2.00 mg/ml of an EndoS D233Q solution (PBS) (10.0 μl) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 28° C. or 37° C. for 48 hours. The subsequent procedures were performed in the same way as in Example 5-1 to calculate the rate of transglycosylation at each point in time of a reaction (Table 5).

 When an oxazoline form was not used as a glycan donor, the transglycosylation reaction were confirmed to proceed efficiently by mixing two types of Endo enzyme mutants at an appropriate ratio. When enzyme A has high hydrolyzing activity, the rate of transglycosylation is low even if a mutant that exhibits reduced hydrolyzing activity is used as enzyme B. Enzyme Bs that exhibit reduced hydrolyzing activity differ in reaction time until the rate of transglycosylation exceeds 90%, depending on the degree thereof. EndoCC whose optimum reaction temperature is reportedly 50° C. tends to yield a higher rate of transfer at a higher reaction temperature. A chemically modified glycan structure can be introduced to a Fc-containing molecule by selecting a properly chemically modified glycan donor. For example, provided that (N3—PEG(3)-SG-)Asn-PEG(3)-N3 is used instead of the glycan donor SGP or (SG-)Asn, the corresponding glycan can be transferred to a Fc-containing molecule. Also, mAb, CLCH, or Fc can be appropriately used as the Fc-containing molecule. <Example 5-4> Preparation of mAb-A-[PEG(3)-N3]4 Using ([N3-PEG(3)]2-SG-)Asn-PEG(3)-N3  mAb-A-[PEG(3)-N3]4 was prepared by the following method using ([N3-PEG(3)]2-SG-)Asn-PEG(3)-N3 as a glycan donor.

Then, a purification method (purification apparatus and column) and an ultrafiltration method (ultrafiltration membrane) suitable for the reaction scale were selected in accordance with the method described in Example 3-1 to obtain 14.78 mg/mL of a mAb-A-[PEG(3)-N3]4 solution (5% sorbitol/10 mM acetate buffer solution (pH 5.5)) (500 μl).

To 39.2 mg/ml of the (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-CLCH-B solution (50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4)) (150 μl), a 50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4) (50 μl), the ([N3-PEG(3)]2-SG-)Asn-PEG(3)-N3 (53.0 mg) solution (50 mM Tris buffer solution (pH 7.4)) (240 μl) prepared in step (1-12A), 1 U/ml of an EndoM N175Q solution (manufactured by Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.) (50 μl) and 2.10 mg/ml of an EndoS D233Q/Q303L solution (PBS) (100 μl) were added, and the mixture was incubated at 28° C. for 20 hours. Then, a purification method (purification apparatus and column) and an ultrafiltration method (ultrafiltration membrane) suitable for the reaction scale were selected in accordance with the method described in Example 3-8 to obtain 8.92 mg/mL of a CLCH-B-[PEG(3)-N3]4 solution (5% sorbitol/10 mM acetate buffer solution (pH 5.5)) (500 ul). ESI-MS: calculated for the heavy chain of CLCH-B-[PEG(3)-N3]4(-Lys), M=38706.3; found 38706.1 (deconvolution data). calculated for the light chain of CLCH-B-[PEG(3)-N3]4, M=11507.8; found 11506.7 (deconvolution data). <Example 5-6> Preparation of Fc-A-[PEG(3)-N3]4 Using ([N3-PEG(3)]2-SG-)Asn-PEG(3)-N3  Fc-A-[PEG(3)-N3]4 was prepared by the following method using ([N3-PEG(3)]2-SG-)Asn-PEG(3)-N3 as a glycan donor.

","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF DRAWINGS FIG. 1 schematically shows the conjugate of the present invention (molecule (I)). The moiety (a) depicts a hANP peptide, the moiety (b) depicts a PEG linker, and the moiety (c) depicts a N297 glycan (wherein the open ellipse depicts NeuAc(Sia), the open hexagon depicts Man, the filled hexagon depicts GlcNAc, the open rhomboid depicts Gal, and the open inverted triangle depicts Fuc). The Y shape depicts a Fc-containing molecule, which is illustrated as full-length IgG containing Fab for the sake of convenience. However, the Fc-containing molecule in the conjugate of the present invention can be any molecule having a Fc region to which the N297 glycan is bonded. In this schematic diagram, the N297 glycan is indicated as N297-(Fuc)SG for the sake of convenience and is shown in a form in which PEG linkers are bonded to sialic acid residues at the non-reducing ends of all branched chains. However, N297-(Fuc)MSG adopted as the N297 glycan may have sialic acid bonded to the PEG linker in any one of the two branched chains and have no sialic acid at the non-reducing end of the other branched chain. Such a notation is applied throughout the present specification, unless otherwise specified. FIG. 2 is a schematic diagram showing the structures of a (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-Fc-containing molecule (molecule (II) of FIG. 2A) and a SG type glycan-remodeled Fc-containing molecule (molecule (III) of FIG. 2B), which are intermediates for the production of the conjugate of the present invention. In both the drawings, the Y shape depicts the same Fc-containing molecule as in FIG. 1. In FIG. 2A, the moiety (d) depicts a N297 glycan consisting only of GlcNAc having α-glycosidic bonds at the 1- and 6-positions of Fuc. In FIG. 2B, the moiety (c) depicts the same N297 glycan as in FIG. 1, and the moiety (e) depicts a terminal functional group (an azide group is exemplified herein, though the functional group is not limited thereto) that is a partial structure of a PEG linker and is subjected to binding to another linker molecule. The binding pattern of the PEG linker is as described in FIG. 1. FIG. 3A Each of FIGS. 3A and 3B is a schematic diagram of the step of producing a SG type glycan-remodeled Fc-containing molecule from a Fc-containing molecule produced in an animal cell. In the drawings, the molecules (II) and (III) depict a (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-Fc-containing molecule and a SG type glycan-remodeled Fc-containing molecule, respectively, as in FIG. 2. The molecule (IV) is a Fc-containing molecule produced in an animal cell and is a mixture of molecules having heterogeneous N297 glycans. FIG. 3A shows the step of treating heterogeneous N297 glycans in the molecule (IV) with hydrolase such as EndoS to prepare a homogeneous (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-Fc-containing molecule (II). The SG type glycan donor molecule used herein has PEG linker-modified sialic acid at the non-reducing end of SG(10), MSG1(9) or MSG2(9). In the prepared SG type N297 glycan-remodeled Fc-containing molecule, sialic acid at the non-reducing end is also similarly modified, as described in FIG. 2B. In the drawings, the donor molecule is indicated in a form using SG(10) for the sake of convenience. However, a remodeling Fc-containing molecule in which a linker molecule having a functional group at any one of the two non-reducing ends of the N297 glycan is bonded to a remodeling antibody is synthesized as the molecule (III) by using MSG1(9) or MSG2(9) as the glycan donor. FIG. 3B Each of FIGS. 3A and 3B is a schematic diagram of the step of producing a SG type glycan-remodeled Fc-containing molecule from a Fc-containing molecule produced in an animal cell. In the drawings, the molecules (II) and (III) depict a (Fucα1,6)GlcNAc-Fc-containing molecule and a SG type glycan-remodeled Fc-containing molecule, respectively, as in FIG. 2. The molecule (IV) is a Fc-containing molecule produced in an animal cell and is a mixture of molecules having heterogeneous N297 glycans. FIG. 3B shows the step of transglycosylating a glycan of a SG type glycan donor molecule to GlcNAc of a N297 glycan in the Fc-containing molecule (II) by use of a glycosyltransferase such as an EndoS D233Q mutant to prepare a SG type glycan-remodeled Fc-containing molecule (III). The SG type glycan donor molecule used herein has PEG linker-modified sialic acid at the non-reducing end of SG(10), MSG1(9) or MSG2(9). In the prepared SG type N297 glycan-remodeled Fc-containing molecule, sialic acid at the non-reducing end is also similarly modified, as described in FIG. 2B. In the drawings, the donor molecule is indicated in a form using SG(10) for the sake of convenience. However, a remodeling Fc-containing molecule in which a linker molecule having a functional group at any one of the two non-reducing ends of the N297 glycan is bonded to a remodeling antibody is synthesized as the molecule (III) by using MSG1(9) or MSG2(9) as the glycan donor.

For each compound, the solid line depicts the amount of the conjugate detected, and the broken line depicts the amount of the human Fc-containing molecule detected, as in FIG. 7 ","['US20190169293A1-20190606-D00000.TIF', 'US20190169293A1-20190606-D00001.TIF', 'US20190169293A1-20190606-D00002.TIF', 'US20190169293A1-20190606-D00003.TIF', 'US20190169293A1-20190606-D00004.TIF', 'US20190169293A1-20190606-D00005.TIF']","Human atrial natriuretic peptides (hANPs) are biologically active peptides having a vasodilatory effect, a diuretic effect, a cell growth inhibitory effect, a venous return lowering effect, and a sympathetic activity inhibitory effect. Native hANP rapidly loses its activity in blood, for example, through cleavage by neutral endopeptidase (NEP) in the blood. In Japan, hANP is clinically applied as a therapeutic drug for acute heart failure, but needs to be continuously administered via intravenous infusion or the like, under blood pressure monitoring, for the purpose of avoiding a sharp drop in blood pressure after administration. Endogenous biologically active peptides such as hANP have very high selectivity for their specific receptors and can therefore be expected to have high efficacy and safety. On the other hand, such biologically active peptides are known to have a very short half-life in blood because the biologically active peptide are rapidly metabolized by various metabolic enzymes during systemic circulation or rapidly excreted by glomerular filtration in the kidney. Hence, attempts have been made to prolong the half-lives in blood of such peptides by imparting metabolic enzyme resistance thereto or circumventing renal excretion. Examples thereof include various methods such as a glycosylated peptide (Patent Literature 1), a fusion polypeptide (Patent Literature 2), an albumin fusion peptide (Patent Literature 3 and Non Patent Literature 1), an immunoglobulin Fc fusion peptide (Patent Literature 4 and Non Patent Literature 2), and a polyethylene glycol (PEG)-modified peptide (Non Patent Literatures 3 and 4). Antibody drugs have a very long half-life in blood as compared with peptide drugs or protein drugs, through a recycling mechanism mediated by a neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) (Non Patent Literature 5). Hence, fusion peptides expected to produce a similar recycling effect have also been considered as a means of prolonging the half-life of hANP (Patent Literatures 3 and 4 and Non Patent Literatures 1 and 2). However, it has been suggested that when hANP, which is rapidly metabolized in blood, is directly loaded onto a carrier protein, the hANP moiety on the carrier undergoes metabolism during circulation. Thus, “hANP-protein fusions” are difficult to retain in the blood at a level equivalent to the retention, in the blood, of the carrier protein moiety (Non Patent Literature 2). In recent years, the technical development of antibody-drug conjugates has been actively performed, and various synthesis methods have been reported (Non Patent Literatures 6, 7, and 8). However, if a conjugation method that diminishes the compatibility of a carrier protein with a drug moiety to be loaded thereon is adopted, the carrier moiety or the drug moiety might be destabilized so that the half-life in blood is not prolonged or agglutination is increased. Therefore, it is very important to select the optimum conjugation method or linker. In general, biopharmaceuticals are known to migrate gradually into the blood by subcutaneous administration rather than intravenous administration (Non Patent Literature 9). However, it is difficult to predict the pharmacokinetics of chemically-modified antibodies. Thus, there is a demand for the development of hANP formulations that possess all of the following: gradual migration into the blood, a sufficient retention time in the blood, and maintenance of activity necessary for pharmacological effects.

","CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 62/383,330, filed Sep. 2, 2016, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. FIELD Provided herein are cyclic peptide analogs, pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of treating cancer with such compounds. BACKGROUND Cancer is a serious and debilitating disease brought on by abnormal and unchecked cell division in a patient. Current treatment strategies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. These treatment options may be singular treatments or combined for a more effective regimen. Unfortunately, many patients do not respond well to current chemotherapeutic regimens or develop resistance after prolonged treatment. In addition, for many chemotherapeutics, there is a maximal lifetime level of drug that a patient may be administered. In this case, new drugs must be tried. Thus, there is a need for development of new and varied chemotherapeutic compounds to assist in the treatment of cancer. An important aspect of cancer, as opposed to infection caused by an exogenous pathogen for example, is that the disease is caused by cells already existing in the patient. These cells are similar in many ways to healthy tissue and reside among healthy cells in the patient. Thus, chemotherapeutic compounds, even if directly administered to a tumor, run the risk of entering and affecting healthy tissue in addition to cancerous tissue. This non-specific delivery can cause systemic and serious side effects in a patient including nausea, weakness, bleeding problems, infection, and hair loss. To avoid these systemic effects, chemotherapeutic compounds may be conjugated to a targeting molecule that assists with the specific and direct delivery of a chemotherapeutic compound to cancerous tissue only, preventing delivery to healthy tissue. These drugs may be associated with fewer and less severe side effects than traditional therapy, and so there is a need to develop chemotherapeutics that are effective in isolation, but are also suitable for conjugation to a targeting molecule. Various types of agents have been described for use in treatment of cancer. Many of these compounds pose challenges. For instance, many compounds described for use in treatment of cancer have problems associated with toxicity. Some compounds present challenges related to their chemical synthesis. There are also challenges associated with finding appropriate permutations of therapeutic agents for combination therapy. Furthermore, only a minority of agents identified for use in treatment of cancer are suitable for conjugation to a targeting moiety. Accordingly, there remains a need for new compounds and conjugates for use in treatment of cancer. SUMMARY In one aspect, provided is a compound of Formula (I):

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION Definitions As used herein, reference to “about” a value or parameter herein includes (and describes) embodiments that are directed to that value or parameter per se. For example, description referring to “about X” includes description of “X”. Unless clearly indicated otherwise, “an individual” as used herein intends a mammal, including but not limited to a human, bovine, primate, equine, canine, feline, porcine, and ovine animals. Thus, the compositions and methods provided herein have use in both human medicine and in the veterinary context, including use in agricultural animals and domestic pets. The individual may be a human who has been diagnosed with or is suspected of having a condition described herein, such as cancer. The individual may be a human who exhibits one or more symptoms associated with a condition described herein, such as cancer. The individual may be a human who has a mutated or abnormal gene associated with a condition described herein, such as cancer. The individual may be a human who is genetically or otherwise predisposed to or at risk of developing a condition described herein, such as cancer. As used herein, “treatment” or “treating” is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including clinical results. For purposes of the compositions and methods provided herein, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the condition, diminishing the extent of the condition, stabilizing the condition (e.g., preventing or delaying the worsening of the condition), preventing or delaying the spread (e.g., metastasis) of the condition, delaying or slowing the progression of the condition, ameliorating a disease state, providing a remission (whether partial or total) of a disease, decreasing the dose of one or more other medications required to treat the condition, enhancing the effect of another medication used to treat the condition, increasing the quality of life of an individual having the condition, and/or prolonging survival. A method of treating cancer encompasses a reduction of the pathological consequence of cancer. The methods described herein contemplate any one or more of these aspects of treatment. As used herein, an “at risk” individual is an individual who is at risk of developing a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer. An individual “at risk” may or may not have detectable disease, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease prior to the treatment methods described herein. “At risk” denotes that an individual has one or more so-called risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing the disease or condition than an individual without these risk factor(s). As used herein, by “combination therapy” is meant a therapy that includes two or more different compounds. Thus, in one aspect, a combination therapy comprising a compound detailed herein and another compound is provided. In some variations, the combination therapy optionally includes one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, non-pharmaceutically active compounds, and/or inert substances. In various embodiments, treatment with a combination therapy may result in an additive or even synergistic (e.g., greater than additive) result compared to administration of a single compound provided herein alone. In some embodiments, a lower amount of each compound is used as part of a combination therapy compared to the amount generally used for individual therapy. Preferably, the same or greater therapeutic benefit is achieved using a combination therapy than by using any of the individual compounds alone. In some embodiments, the same or greater therapeutic benefit is achieved using a smaller amount (e.g., a lower dose or a less frequent dosing schedule) of a compound in a combination therapy than the amount generally used for individual compound or therapy. Preferably, the use of a small amount of compound results in a reduction in the number, severity, frequency, and/or duration of one or more side-effects associated with the compound. As used herein, the term “effective amount” intends such amount of a compound provided herein which in combination with its parameters of efficacy and toxicity, should be effective in a given therapeutic form. As is understood in the art, an effective amount may be in one or more doses, i.e., a single dose or multiple doses may be required to achieve the desired treatment endpoint. An effective amount may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable or beneficial result may be or is achieved. Suitable doses of any of the co-administered compounds may optionally be lowered due to the combined action (e.g., additive or synergistic effects) of the compounds. In various embodiments, an effective amount of the composition or therapy may (i) reduce the number of cancer cells; (ii) reduce tumor size; (iii) inhibit, retard, slow to some extent, and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; (iv) inhibit (e.g., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; (v) inhibit tumor growth; (vi) prevent or delay occurrence and/or recurrence of a tumor; and/or (vii) relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. In various embodiments, the amount is sufficient to ameliorate, palliate, lessen, and/or delay one or more of symptoms of a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer. As is understood in the art, an “effective amount” may be in one or more doses, i.e., a single dose or multiple doses may be required to achieve the desired treatment endpoint. An effective amount may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable or beneficial result may be or is achieved. A “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of a compound or salt thereof sufficient to produce a desired therapeutic outcome (e.g., reducing the severity or duration of, stabilizing the severity of, or eliminating one or more symptoms of a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer). For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include, e.g., decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the disease (biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral), including its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease or condition, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease or condition, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease or condition, enhancing effect of another medication, delaying the progression of the disease or condition, and/or prolonging survival of patients. It is understood that an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, including a prophylactically effective amount, may be given to an individual in the adjuvant setting, which refers to a clinical setting in which an individual has had a history of cancer, and generally (but not necessarily) has been responsive to therapy, which includes, but is not limited to, surgery (e.g., surgical resection), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, because of their history of cancer, these individuals are considered at risk of developing cancer. Treatment or administration in the “adjuvant setting” refers to a subsequent mode of treatment. As used herein, by “pharmaceutically acceptable” or “pharmacologically acceptable” is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, e.g., the material may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition administered to a patient without causing any significant undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the composition in which it is contained. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients have preferably met the required standards of toxicological and manufacturing testing and/or are included on the Inactive Ingredient Guide prepared by the U.S. Food and Drug administration. “Pharmaceutically acceptable salts” are those salts which retain at least some of the biological activity of the free (non-salt) compound and which can be administered as drugs or pharmaceuticals to an individual. Such salts, for example, include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. Acceptable organic bases include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared in situ in the manufacturing process, or by separately reacting a purified compound provided herein in its free acid or base form with a suitable organic or inorganic base or acid, respectively, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. The term “excipient” as used herein means an inert or inactive substance that may be used in the production of a drug or pharmaceutical, such as a tablet containing a compound provided herein as an active ingredient. Various substances may be embraced by the term excipient, including without limitation any substance used as a binder, disintegrant, coating, compression/encapsulation aid, cream or lotion, lubricant, solutions for parenteral administration, materials for chewable tablets, sweetener or flavoring, suspending/gelling agent, or wet granulation agent. Binders include, e.g., carbomers, povidone, xanthan gum, etc.; coatings include, e.g., cellulose acetate phthalate, ethylcellulose, gellan gum, maltodextrin, enteric coatings, etc.; compression/encapsulation aids include, e.g., calcium carbonate, dextrose, fructose dc (dc=“directly compressible”), honey dc, lactose (anhydrate or monohydrate; optionally in combination with aspartame, cellulose, or microcrystalline cellulose), starch dc, sucrose, etc.; disintegrants include, e.g., croscarmellose sodium, gellan gum, sodium starch glycolate, etc.; creams or lotions include, e.g., maltodextrin, carrageenans, etc.; lubricants include, e.g., magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, etc.; materials for chewable tablets include, e.g., dextrose, fructose dc, lactose (monohydrate, optionally in combination with aspartame or cellulose), etc.; suspending/gelling agents include, e.g., carrageenan, sodium starch glycolate, xanthan gum, etc.; sweeteners include, e.g., aspartame, dextrose, fructose dc, sorbitol, sucrose dc, etc.; and wet granulation agents include, e.g., calcium carbonate, maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose. etc. “Alkyl” refers to and includes saturated linear or branched univalent hydrocarbon structures and combinations thereof.

Ligands The term “ligand” as used herein refers to any molecule or moiety connected to the compounds described herein. “Ligand” may refer to one or more ligands attached to a compound. Likewise, multiple compounds may be attached to a single ligand. Ligands may serve a number of purposes including facilitating uptake of the conjugate into a target cell or tissue and directing the conjugate to a particular cell or tissue (also referred to as conjugate targeting). A ligand may also serve to enhance the efficacy of the compounds by, for example, inhibiting or interacting with cellular factors that may inhibit or reduce the efficacy of the compounds described herein. The compound as described herein may be conjugated to one or more ligands. The term “ligand” as used herein refers to one or more ligands. In some embodiments, a ligand is an antibody, or fragment thereof. In other embodiments, the ligand is a peptide or protein. In yet other embodiments, the ligand is another moiety useful for directing the compounds described herein to a target cell or tissue. Antibody ligands include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, multivalent antibodies, humanized antibodies, and antibody fragments. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment(s). In one embodiment the term “antibody” encompasses a molecule comprising at least one variable region from a light chain immunoglobulin molecule and at least one variable region from a heavy chain molecule that in combination form a specific binding site for the target antigen. In one embodiment, the antibody is an IgG antibody. For example, the antibody is an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 antibody. The term “monoclonal antibody,” as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies. A monoclonal antibody composition typically displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. In contrast, polyclonal antibody compositions typically include a multitude of antibodies that may be directed against different epitopes of the same target molecule. A polyclonal antibody composition may contain a plurality of monoclonal antibodies with different epitope specificities, affinities, or avidities within a single antigen that contains multiple antigenic epitopes. The term “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with any of the compositions, uses, or methods described herein may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) Nature 256: 495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clarkson et al. (1991) Nature 352: 624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597, for example. As used herein, the term “humanized antibody” refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies as well as human antibodies. These antibodies retain the activity of a non-human antibody while being less immunogenic in humans. Humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies which contain at least part of its sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all the non-human CDR regions, while the remaining parts of the antibody may be replaced by the corresponding human counterparts. In some embodiments, the humanized antibody retains at least one complete non-human variable domain. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Queen et al. (1989) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033; and Antibody Engineering: A Practical Approach (Oxford University Press 1996). The term “recombinant antibody”, as used herein, includes all human and non-human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) or a hybridoma prepared therefrom, antibodies isolated from a host cell transformed to express the antibody, e.g., from a transfectoma, antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial antibody library, and antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of all or a portion of a human immunoglobulin gene, sequences to other DNA sequences. Exemplary peptide or protein ligands include receptor ligands for targeting delivery of the conjugate to a particular cell. Receptor ligands may engage with their target receptor and provide specific targeting to a tissue or cell type that expresses that receptor. This receptor engagement may also facilitate cellular uptake of the conjugate. Exemplary peptides may also include targeting peptides to facilitate passage across the cell membrane or intracellular targeting including, but not limited to, targeting to organelles such as the nucleus, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, and mitochondria. In some embodiments, the ligand is an antibody that is specific for a cancer cell antigen. A “cancer cell antigen” is a peptide or molecular moiety expressed by a cancer cell that is recognized by an antibody. Antibodies specific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. In additional embodiments, the peptide ligand is an interferon, a lymphokine, or a hormone. Additional exemplary ligands include nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, RNA, PNA, etc.) or other molecules known in the art that would be useful for conjugation to the presently described compounds. Linkers In one embodiment, the compounds described herein comprise one or more linker or linking group. The term “linker”, “linker molecule”, “linking group”, or “linker moiety” as used herein refers to a chemical moiety comprising a covalent bond and/or a chain of atoms that covalently attaches a ligand to a drug moiety or other molecule. For example, exemplary linkers, including their structure and synthesis, are described in WO 2004/010957, U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2006/0074008, U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2005/0238649, and U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2006/0024317, U.S. Pat. Publ. Nos. 2003/0083263, 2005/0238649 and 2005/0009751, WO 2015/095755, W. C. Widdison et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 2015, 26, 2261; D. Shabat et al., New J. Chem., 2012, 36, 386; F. M. H. de Groot et al., J. Org. Chem., 2001, 66, 8815; J. M. DeSimone et al., Med. Chem. Comm., 2014, 5, 1355; and R. M. Garbaccio et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 2016, 138(4), 1430, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. The linker may be cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers are typically cleavable under intracellular conditions, such that the linker itself is degraded and releases the compound from the ligand. Non-cleavable linkers do not degrade intracellularly and in this embodiment, the compound is released from the ligand via degradation of the ligand. A conjugate as described herein may or may not comprise a linker molecule or moiety. A person of skill in the art could determine the appropriate type of linker based on the type of treatment or tissue being targeted by the conjugate. Exemplary linking moieties include hydrazones, peptides, chelating agents, maleimides, disufide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase labile groups, as known to one of skill in the art. Linker moieties may comprise a divalent radical such as an alkyldiyl, an arylene, a heteroarylene, moieties such as: —(CR2)nO(CR2)n—, repeating units of alkyloxy (e.g. polyethylenoxy, PEG, polymethyleneoxy) and alkylamino (e.g. polyethyleneamino, Jeffamine™); and diacid ester and amides including succinate, succinamide, diglycolate, malonate, and caproamide. Cleavable linkers may be cleaved or degraded by a cleaving agent (e.g. a protease or reducing agent) present in the intracellular environment. In some embodiments, the linker is a peptidyl linker that is cleaved by an intracellular peptidase or protease enzyme, including, but not limited to, a lysosomal or endosomal protease. In some embodiments, the peptidyl linker is at least two amino acids long. Protein and peptide cleaving agents can include cathepsins B and D and plasmin, all of which are known to cleave dipeptides resulting in the release of active drug inside target cells (see, e.g., Dubowchik and Walker (1999) Pharm. Therapeutics 83:67-123). For example, a peptidyl linker that is cleavable by the thiol-dependent protease cathepsin-B, which is highly expressed in cancerous tissue, can be used (e.g., a Phe-Leu containing linker). Other examples of such linkers are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. In a specific embodiment, the peptidyl linker cleavable by an intracellular protease is a Val-Cit linker or a Phe-Lys linker (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, which describes the synthesis of doxorubicin with the val-cit linker). A cleavable linker may be fully cleaved by a cleaving agent to release the compound to which it is bound. Alternatively, a cleavable linker may be partially cleaved, such that a portion of the linker remains bound to the compound. For example, if a linker is bound to a compound via a group —C(O)N(CH3)CH2CH2N(CH3)—, the linker may be partially cleaved such that group —C(O)N(CH3)CH2CH2NHCH3 remains bound to the compound. In other embodiments, the cleavable linker is pH-sensitive. Typically, the pH-sensitive linker is unstable and degrades under acidic conditions. For example, an acid-labile linker that is cleavable in the lysosome (e.g., a hydrazone, semicarbazone, thiosemicarbazone, cis-aconitic amide, orthoester, acetal, ketal, or the like) can be used. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,122,368; 5,824,805; 5,622,929; Dubowchik and Walker (1999) Pharm. Therapeutics 83:67-123; Neville et al. (1989) Biol. Chem. 264:14653-14661.) Such linkers are relatively stable under neutral pH conditions, such as those in the blood, but are unstable at below pH 5.5 or 5.0, the approximate pH of the lysosome. Typically, the linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment. As used herein, “not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment,” in the context of a linker, means that no more than about 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, or 1% of the linkers, in a sample of compound-ligand conjugate compound, are cleaved when the antibody-drug conjugate compound is in an extracellular environment. Whether a linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment can be determined using methods known to those of skill in the relevant art. In some embodiments, the linker contains a spacer unit. In some embodiments, the spacer unit contains a para-aminobenzoate (PAB) moiety. In some embodiments, the linker contains a stretcher unit. In some embodiments, the stretcher unit contains a maleimide moiety. In some embodiments, the linking groups will be bifunctional, meaning they comprise two reactive sites, wherein a first reactive site may be bound to the compounds described herein and the second reactive site may be bound to the ligand. The linker may be hetero-bifunctional, indicating that the binding moieties on either end of the linker moiety are different. In some embodiments, conjugates of the ligand and compound are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidoberizoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al (1987) Science, 238:1098. Carbon-14-labeled 1 -isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the compound or ligand (WO94/11026). The compounds described herein can be linked to ligands via an acid labile linker as previously described (Blattler et al, 24 Biochemistry, 1517-1524 (1985), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,542,225, 4,569,789 and 4,764,368). The compounds described herein can be linked to ligands via a photolabile linker as previously described (Senter et al, 42 Photochemistry and Photobiology, 231-237 (1985), U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,014). The compounds described herein can be linked to a ligand to produce a conjugate that can be cleaved by intracellular esterases to liberate free drug. (For examples see: U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 and Aboud-Pirak et al, 38 Biochem. Pharmacol., 641-648 (1989), Laguzza et al, 32 J. Med. Chem., 549-555 (1989)). The compounds described herein can also be linked to ligands via peptide spacer linkers. It has been previously shown that short peptide spacers between drugs and macromolecular carriers are stable in serum but are readily hydrolyzed by intracellular lysosomal peptidases (Trouet et al, 79 Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. 626-629 (1982)). Functional groups on the compound that can serve as a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand using the coupling methods described herein include, without limitation, —OH, —NHR, —NHNH2, —ONH2, —SH, —CO2H, and other functional groups. In any of the variations of Formulae (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), and (Ie) described herein, the compound may be modified to contain one or more functional groups that can serve as a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand at any chemically feasible position. In some embodiments, any of the variations of Formulae (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), and (Ic) may contain one or more moieties selected from the group consisting of —OH, —NHR, —NHNH2, —ONH2, —N3, —SH, —CO2H at any chemically feasible position. In some embodiments, a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand can be located on an amino acid side chain. In other embodiments, a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand can be located at position Y4. In other embodiments, a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand can be located at positions R2, R8a, R8b, R15, or R4. In some variations the linker is of formula (L-Fn), where the linker is bonded to a compound provided herein via the bond shown as

General Synthetic Methods Compounds of Formula (I) will now be described by reference to illustrative synthetic schemes for their general preparation below and the specific examples that follow. Artisans will recognize that, to obtain the various compounds herein, starting materials may be suitably selected so that the ultimately desired substituents will be carried through the reaction scheme with or without protection as appropriate to yield the desired product. Alternatively, it may be necessary or desirable to employ, in the place of the ultimately desired substituent, a suitable group that may be carried through the reaction scheme and replaced as appropriate with the desired substituent. In addition, one of skill in the art will recognize that protecting groups may be used to protect certain functional groups (amino, carboxy, or side chain groups) from reaction conditions, and that such groups are removed under standard conditions when appropriate. Unless otherwise specified, the variables are as defined above in reference to Formula (I). Where it is desired to obtain a particular enantiomer of a compound, this may be accomplished from a corresponding mixture of enantiomers using any suitable conventional procedure for separating or resolving enantiomers. Thus, for example, diastereomeric derivatives may be produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers, e.g. a racemate, and an appropriate chiral compound. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallization and the desired enantiomer recovered. In another resolution process, a racemate may be separated using chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Alternatively, if desired a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropriate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described. Chromatography, recrystallization and other conventional separation procedures may also be used with intermediates or final products where it is desired to obtain a particular isomer of a compound or to otherwise purify a product of a reaction. General methods of preparing compounds described herein are depicted in exemplified methods below. Variable groups in the schemes provided herein are defined as for Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId), (IIe), (III), (IIIa), (IIIb), (IIIc), (IIId), (IIIe), (IV), (IVa), (IVb), (IVc), (IVd), (IVe), or any variation thereof. Other compounds described herein may be prepared by similar methods. For example, Scheme 1b is an exemplified synthesis of the method detailed in Scheme 1a, but other compounds described herein may be prepared by similar methods. Peptide coupling, esterification, and deprotection reactions referred to herein can be carried out using methods known in the art. 


 Protected di-peptide E-1 is subjected to a peptide coupling reaction to form protected tri-peptide E-2. Protecting group PGa is removed, followed by a further peptide coupling reaction to afford compound E-3. Protecting group PGb is then removed, followed by a further peptide coupling reaction to afford compound E-4. 


 Compound E-4 is reacted with compound E-5a under suitable conditions to afford compound E-6a. 


 Selective deprotection of compound E-6a to remove protecting group PG3 affords compound E-7b. This compound is subject to peptide coupling or esterification to afford compound E-8b. Removal of protecting groups PG1 and PG4, cyclization via a peptide coupling reaction, and removal of protecting group PG2 afford compounds of Formula E-9b.

Example 70 Synthesis of Conjugates C24, C25, and C26 The antibody-drug conjugates C24-26, wherein Ab is Trastuzumab Biosimilar (TBS) antibody, were synthesized using protocols similar to methods described previously (Ref: Bryant, P. et al, Mol. Pharmaceuticals, 2015, 12, 1872-1879). Briefly, the purified antibody, Trastuzumab Biosimilar (TBS, 1-2 mg) was buffer exchanged with PBS (1× solution, pH 7.5) and EDTA (20 mM) mix and diluted to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. A stock solution of TCEP (1 mM) was freshly prepared in PBS, and 6 molar equiv. (relative to the antibody concentration) was added to the antibody and left the mixture on a heat block. After 1 h, the partially reduced antibody was removed from the heat block and cooled to room temperature. A stock solution of Conjugate L24, L25, and L26 (5 mM in DMSO) was freshly prepared, and 6-8 molar equiv was added to the antibody. The reaction was incubated at RT for 15-20 h under mild agitation. Then the reaction mixture was passed through a spin column (Zeba, 2 mL) to remove small MW reagents and buffer exchanged by ultrafiltration (10 kDa MWCO) into PBS to afford the ADC, C24-C27 in PBS. The resulting ADC had an average DAR around 4 by HIC. The aggregation was measured by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and it was less than 1%.

After 24 hours of incubation in a humidified incubator at 37° C. with 5% CO2 and 95% air, 10 μL of 10×, serially diluted test agents in growth medium were added to each well (10 pt dose response curve, highest concentration 10 μM of test agent). After 72 hours of culture in a humidified incubator at 37° C., in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air, the plated cells and Cell Titer-Glo® (Protnega G7571) reagents were brought to room temperature to equilibrate for 30 minutes. 100 μL of Cell Titer-Glo® reagent was added to each well. The plate was shaken for two minutes and then left to equilibrate for ten minutes. The media/Cell Titer-Glo® reagent was transferred to a white polystyrene 96-well microculture plate (Corning® Costar® 96-well flat bottom plate, Cat. #3917) before reading luminescence on a Tecan GENios microplate reader. Percent inhibition of cell growth was calculated relative to untreated control wells. The IC50 value for the test agents was determined using Prism 6.05 by curve-fitting of the data using the following four parameter-logistic equation:

Current treatment strategies include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery. These treatment options may be singular treatments or combined for a more effective regimen. Unfortunately, many patients do not respond well to current chemotherapeutic regimens or develop resistance after prolonged treatment. In addition, for many chemotherapeutics, there is a maximal lifetime level of drug that a patient may be administered. In this case, new drugs must be tried. Thus, there is a need for development of new and varied chemotherapeutic compounds to assist in the treatment of cancer. An important aspect of cancer, as opposed to infection caused by an exogenous pathogen for example, is that the disease is caused by cells already existing in the patient. These cells are similar in many ways to healthy tissue and reside among healthy cells in the patient. Thus, chemotherapeutic compounds, even if directly administered to a tumor, run the risk of entering and affecting healthy tissue in addition to cancerous tissue. This non-specific delivery can cause systemic and serious side effects in a patient including nausea, weakness, bleeding problems, infection, and hair loss. To avoid these systemic effects, chemotherapeutic compounds may be conjugated to a targeting molecule that assists with the specific and direct delivery of a chemotherapeutic compound to cancerous tissue only, preventing delivery to healthy tissue. These drugs may be associated with fewer and less severe side effects than traditional therapy, and so there is a need to develop chemotherapeutics that are effective in isolation, but are also suitable for conjugation to a targeting molecule. Various types of agents have been described for use in treatment of cancer. Many of these compounds pose challenges. For instance, many compounds described for use in treatment of cancer have problems associated with toxicity. Some compounds present challenges related to their chemical synthesis. There are also challenges associated with finding appropriate permutations of therapeutic agents for combination therapy. Furthermore, only a minority of agents identified for use in treatment of cancer are suitable for conjugation to a targeting moiety. Accordingly, there remains a need for new compounds and conjugates for use in treatment of cancer. ",,"In one aspect, provided is a compound of Formula (I):

BRIEF ","Definitions As used herein, reference to “about” a value or parameter herein includes (and describes) embodiments that are directed to that value or parameter per se. For example, description referring to “about X” includes description of “X”. Unless clearly indicated otherwise, “an individual” as used herein intends a mammal, including but not limited to a human, bovine, primate, equine, canine, feline, porcine, and ovine animals. Thus, the compositions and methods provided herein have use in both human medicine and in the veterinary context, including use in agricultural animals and domestic pets. The individual may be a human who has been diagnosed with or is suspected of having a condition described herein, such as cancer. The individual may be a human who exhibits one or more symptoms associated with a condition described herein, such as cancer. The individual may be a human who has a mutated or abnormal gene associated with a condition described herein, such as cancer. The individual may be a human who is genetically or otherwise predisposed to or at risk of developing a condition described herein, such as cancer. As used herein, “treatment” or “treating” is an approach for obtaining beneficial or desired results including clinical results. For purposes of the compositions and methods provided herein, beneficial or desired clinical results include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following: decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the condition, diminishing the extent of the condition, stabilizing the condition (e.g., preventing or delaying the worsening of the condition), preventing or delaying the spread (e.g., metastasis) of the condition, delaying or slowing the progression of the condition, ameliorating a disease state, providing a remission (whether partial or total) of a disease, decreasing the dose of one or more other medications required to treat the condition, enhancing the effect of another medication used to treat the condition, increasing the quality of life of an individual having the condition, and/or prolonging survival. A method of treating cancer encompasses a reduction of the pathological consequence of cancer. The methods described herein contemplate any one or more of these aspects of treatment. As used herein, an “at risk” individual is an individual who is at risk of developing a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer. An individual “at risk” may or may not have detectable disease, and may or may not have displayed detectable disease prior to the treatment methods described herein. “At risk” denotes that an individual has one or more so-called risk factors, which are measurable parameters that correlate with development of a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer. An individual having one or more of these risk factors has a higher probability of developing the disease or condition than an individual without these risk factor(s). As used herein, by “combination therapy” is meant a therapy that includes two or more different compounds. Thus, in one aspect, a combination therapy comprising a compound detailed herein and another compound is provided. In some variations, the combination therapy optionally includes one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients, non-pharmaceutically active compounds, and/or inert substances. In various embodiments, treatment with a combination therapy may result in an additive or even synergistic (e.g., greater than additive) result compared to administration of a single compound provided herein alone. In some embodiments, a lower amount of each compound is used as part of a combination therapy compared to the amount generally used for individual therapy. Preferably, the same or greater therapeutic benefit is achieved using a combination therapy than by using any of the individual compounds alone. In some embodiments, the same or greater therapeutic benefit is achieved using a smaller amount (e.g., a lower dose or a less frequent dosing schedule) of a compound in a combination therapy than the amount generally used for individual compound or therapy. Preferably, the use of a small amount of compound results in a reduction in the number, severity, frequency, and/or duration of one or more side-effects associated with the compound. As used herein, the term “effective amount” intends such amount of a compound provided herein which in combination with its parameters of efficacy and toxicity, should be effective in a given therapeutic form. As is understood in the art, an effective amount may be in one or more doses, i.e., a single dose or multiple doses may be required to achieve the desired treatment endpoint. An effective amount may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a single agent may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable or beneficial result may be or is achieved. Suitable doses of any of the co-administered compounds may optionally be lowered due to the combined action (e.g., additive or synergistic effects) of the compounds. In various embodiments, an effective amount of the composition or therapy may (i) reduce the number of cancer cells; (ii) reduce tumor size; (iii) inhibit, retard, slow to some extent, and preferably stop cancer cell infiltration into peripheral organs; (iv) inhibit (e.g., slow to some extent and preferably stop) tumor metastasis; (v) inhibit tumor growth; (vi) prevent or delay occurrence and/or recurrence of a tumor; and/or (vii) relieve to some extent one or more of the symptoms associated with the cancer. In various embodiments, the amount is sufficient to ameliorate, palliate, lessen, and/or delay one or more of symptoms of a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer. As is understood in the art, an “effective amount” may be in one or more doses, i.e., a single dose or multiple doses may be required to achieve the desired treatment endpoint. An effective amount may be considered in the context of administering one or more therapeutic agents, and a compound, or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, may be considered to be given in an effective amount if, in conjunction with one or more other agents, a desirable or beneficial result may be or is achieved. A “therapeutically effective amount” refers to an amount of a compound or salt thereof sufficient to produce a desired therapeutic outcome (e.g., reducing the severity or duration of, stabilizing the severity of, or eliminating one or more symptoms of a disease or condition described herein, such as cancer). For therapeutic use, beneficial or desired results include, e.g., decreasing one or more symptoms resulting from the disease (biochemical, histologic and/or behavioral), including its complications and intermediate pathological phenotypes presenting during development of the disease or condition, increasing the quality of life of those suffering from the disease or condition, decreasing the dose of other medications required to treat the disease or condition, enhancing effect of another medication, delaying the progression of the disease or condition, and/or prolonging survival of patients. It is understood that an effective amount of a compound or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, including a prophylactically effective amount, may be given to an individual in the adjuvant setting, which refers to a clinical setting in which an individual has had a history of cancer, and generally (but not necessarily) has been responsive to therapy, which includes, but is not limited to, surgery (e.g., surgical resection), radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. However, because of their history of cancer, these individuals are considered at risk of developing cancer. Treatment or administration in the “adjuvant setting” refers to a subsequent mode of treatment. As used herein, by “pharmaceutically acceptable” or “pharmacologically acceptable” is meant a material that is not biologically or otherwise undesirable, e.g., the material may be incorporated into a pharmaceutical composition administered to a patient without causing any significant undesirable biological effects or interacting in a deleterious manner with any of the other components of the composition in which it is contained. Pharmaceutically acceptable carriers or excipients have preferably met the required standards of toxicological and manufacturing testing and/or are included on the Inactive Ingredient Guide prepared by the U.S. Food and Drug administration. “Pharmaceutically acceptable salts” are those salts which retain at least some of the biological activity of the free (non-salt) compound and which can be administered as drugs or pharmaceuticals to an individual. Such salts, for example, include: (1) acid addition salts, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, and the like; or formed with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, propionic acid, succinic acid, maleic acid, tartaric acid and the like; (2) salts formed when an acidic proton present in the parent compound either is replaced by a metal ion, e.g., an alkali metal ion, an alkaline earth ion, or an aluminum ion; or coordinates with an organic base. Acceptable organic bases include ethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine and the like. Acceptable inorganic bases include aluminum hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium hydroxide, and the like. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts can be prepared in situ in the manufacturing process, or by separately reacting a purified compound provided herein in its free acid or base form with a suitable organic or inorganic base or acid, respectively, and isolating the salt thus formed during subsequent purification. The term “excipient” as used herein means an inert or inactive substance that may be used in the production of a drug or pharmaceutical, such as a tablet containing a compound provided herein as an active ingredient. Various substances may be embraced by the term excipient, including without limitation any substance used as a binder, disintegrant, coating, compression/encapsulation aid, cream or lotion, lubricant, solutions for parenteral administration, materials for chewable tablets, sweetener or flavoring, suspending/gelling agent, or wet granulation agent. Binders include, e.g., carbomers, povidone, xanthan gum, etc.; coatings include, e.g., cellulose acetate phthalate, ethylcellulose, gellan gum, maltodextrin, enteric coatings, etc.; compression/encapsulation aids include, e.g., calcium carbonate, dextrose, fructose dc (dc=“directly compressible”), honey dc, lactose (anhydrate or monohydrate; optionally in combination with aspartame, cellulose, or microcrystalline cellulose), starch dc, sucrose, etc.; disintegrants include, e.g., croscarmellose sodium, gellan gum, sodium starch glycolate, etc.; creams or lotions include, e.g., maltodextrin, carrageenans, etc.; lubricants include, e.g., magnesium stearate, stearic acid, sodium stearyl fumarate, etc.; materials for chewable tablets include, e.g., dextrose, fructose dc, lactose (monohydrate, optionally in combination with aspartame or cellulose), etc.; suspending/gelling agents include, e.g., carrageenan, sodium starch glycolate, xanthan gum, etc.; sweeteners include, e.g., aspartame, dextrose, fructose dc, sorbitol, sucrose dc, etc.; and wet granulation agents include, e.g., calcium carbonate, maltodextrin, microcrystalline cellulose. etc. “Alkyl” refers to and includes saturated linear or branched univalent hydrocarbon structures and combinations thereof.

Ligands The term “ligand” as used herein refers to any molecule or moiety connected to the compounds described herein. “Ligand” may refer to one or more ligands attached to a compound. Likewise, multiple compounds may be attached to a single ligand. Ligands may serve a number of purposes including facilitating uptake of the conjugate into a target cell or tissue and directing the conjugate to a particular cell or tissue (also referred to as conjugate targeting). A ligand may also serve to enhance the efficacy of the compounds by, for example, inhibiting or interacting with cellular factors that may inhibit or reduce the efficacy of the compounds described herein. The compound as described herein may be conjugated to one or more ligands. The term “ligand” as used herein refers to one or more ligands. In some embodiments, a ligand is an antibody, or fragment thereof. In other embodiments, the ligand is a peptide or protein. In yet other embodiments, the ligand is another moiety useful for directing the compounds described herein to a target cell or tissue. Antibody ligands include monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies (e.g. bispecific antibodies) formed from at least two intact antibodies, multivalent antibodies, humanized antibodies, and antibody fragments. Examples of antibody fragments include Fab, Fab′, F(ab′)2 and Fv fragments; diabodies; linear antibodies; single chain antibody molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragment(s). In one embodiment the term “antibody” encompasses a molecule comprising at least one variable region from a light chain immunoglobulin molecule and at least one variable region from a heavy chain molecule that in combination form a specific binding site for the target antigen. In one embodiment, the antibody is an IgG antibody. For example, the antibody is an IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, or IgG4 antibody. The term “monoclonal antibody,” as used herein, refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies. A monoclonal antibody composition typically displays a single binding specificity and affinity for a particular epitope. In contrast, polyclonal antibody compositions typically include a multitude of antibodies that may be directed against different epitopes of the same target molecule. A polyclonal antibody composition may contain a plurality of monoclonal antibodies with different epitope specificities, affinities, or avidities within a single antigen that contains multiple antigenic epitopes. The term “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with any of the compositions, uses, or methods described herein may be made by the hybridoma method first described by Kohler et al. (1975) Nature 256: 495, or may be made by recombinant DNA methods (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567). The “monoclonal antibodies” may also be isolated from phage antibody libraries using the techniques described in Clarkson et al. (1991) Nature 352: 624-628 and Marks et al. (1991) J. Mol. Biol. 222: 581-597, for example. As used herein, the term “humanized antibody” refers to forms of antibodies that contain sequences from non-human (e.g., murine) antibodies as well as human antibodies. These antibodies retain the activity of a non-human antibody while being less immunogenic in humans. Humanized antibodies are chimeric antibodies which contain at least part of its sequence derived from non-human immunoglobulin. In general, the humanized antibody will comprise substantially all the non-human CDR regions, while the remaining parts of the antibody may be replaced by the corresponding human counterparts. In some embodiments, the humanized antibody retains at least one complete non-human variable domain. The humanized antibody optionally also will comprise at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region (Fc), typically that of a human immunoglobulin. See e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 4,816,567; Queen et al. (1989) Proc. Nat'l Acad. Sci. USA 86:10029-10033; and Antibody Engineering: A Practical Approach (Oxford University Press 1996). The term “recombinant antibody”, as used herein, includes all human and non-human antibodies that are prepared, expressed, created or isolated by recombinant means, such as antibodies isolated from an animal (e.g., a mouse) or a hybridoma prepared therefrom, antibodies isolated from a host cell transformed to express the antibody, e.g., from a transfectoma, antibodies isolated from a recombinant, combinatorial antibody library, and antibodies prepared, expressed, created or isolated by any other means that involve splicing of all or a portion of a human immunoglobulin gene, sequences to other DNA sequences. Exemplary peptide or protein ligands include receptor ligands for targeting delivery of the conjugate to a particular cell. Receptor ligands may engage with their target receptor and provide specific targeting to a tissue or cell type that expresses that receptor. This receptor engagement may also facilitate cellular uptake of the conjugate. Exemplary peptides may also include targeting peptides to facilitate passage across the cell membrane or intracellular targeting including, but not limited to, targeting to organelles such as the nucleus, Golgi apparatus, lysosome, and mitochondria. In some embodiments, the ligand is an antibody that is specific for a cancer cell antigen. A “cancer cell antigen” is a peptide or molecular moiety expressed by a cancer cell that is recognized by an antibody. Antibodies specific for a cancer cell antigen can be obtained commercially or produced by any method known to one of skill in the art such as, e.g., chemical synthesis or recombinant expression techniques. In additional embodiments, the peptide ligand is an interferon, a lymphokine, or a hormone. Additional exemplary ligands include nucleic acids (e.g. DNA, RNA, PNA, etc.) or other molecules known in the art that would be useful for conjugation to the presently described compounds. Linkers In one embodiment, the compounds described herein comprise one or more linker or linking group. The term “linker”, “linker molecule”, “linking group”, or “linker moiety” as used herein refers to a chemical moiety comprising a covalent bond and/or a chain of atoms that covalently attaches a ligand to a drug moiety or other molecule. For example, exemplary linkers, including their structure and synthesis, are described in WO 2004/010957, U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2006/0074008, U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2005/0238649, and U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2006/0024317, U.S. Pat. Publ. Nos. 2003/0083263, 2005/0238649 and 2005/0009751, WO 2015/095755, W. C. Widdison et al., Bioconjugate Chem., 2015, 26, 2261; D. Shabat et al., New J. Chem., 2012, 36, 386; F. M. H. de Groot et al., J. Org. Chem., 2001, 66, 8815; J. M. DeSimone et al., Med. Chem. Comm., 2014, 5, 1355; and R. M. Garbaccio et al., J. Amer. Chem. Soc., 2016, 138(4), 1430, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. The linker may be cleavable or non-cleavable. Cleavable linkers are typically cleavable under intracellular conditions, such that the linker itself is degraded and releases the compound from the ligand. Non-cleavable linkers do not degrade intracellularly and in this embodiment, the compound is released from the ligand via degradation of the ligand. A conjugate as described herein may or may not comprise a linker molecule or moiety. A person of skill in the art could determine the appropriate type of linker based on the type of treatment or tissue being targeted by the conjugate. Exemplary linking moieties include hydrazones, peptides, chelating agents, maleimides, disufide groups, thioether groups, acid labile groups, photolabile groups, peptidase labile groups, or esterase labile groups, as known to one of skill in the art. Linker moieties may comprise a divalent radical such as an alkyldiyl, an arylene, a heteroarylene, moieties such as: —(CR2)nO(CR2)n—, repeating units of alkyloxy (e.g. polyethylenoxy, PEG, polymethyleneoxy) and alkylamino (e.g. polyethyleneamino, Jeffamine™); and diacid ester and amides including succinate, succinamide, diglycolate, malonate, and caproamide. Cleavable linkers may be cleaved or degraded by a cleaving agent (e.g. a protease or reducing agent) present in the intracellular environment. In some embodiments, the linker is a peptidyl linker that is cleaved by an intracellular peptidase or protease enzyme, including, but not limited to, a lysosomal or endosomal protease. In some embodiments, the peptidyl linker is at least two amino acids long. Protein and peptide cleaving agents can include cathepsins B and D and plasmin, all of which are known to cleave dipeptides resulting in the release of active drug inside target cells (see, e.g., Dubowchik and Walker (1999) Pharm. Therapeutics 83:67-123). For example, a peptidyl linker that is cleavable by the thiol-dependent protease cathepsin-B, which is highly expressed in cancerous tissue, can be used (e.g., a Phe-Leu containing linker). Other examples of such linkers are described, e.g., in U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, incorporated herein by reference in its entirety and for all purposes. In a specific embodiment, the peptidyl linker cleavable by an intracellular protease is a Val-Cit linker or a Phe-Lys linker (see, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 6,214,345, which describes the synthesis of doxorubicin with the val-cit linker). A cleavable linker may be fully cleaved by a cleaving agent to release the compound to which it is bound. Alternatively, a cleavable linker may be partially cleaved, such that a portion of the linker remains bound to the compound. For example, if a linker is bound to a compound via a group —C(O)N(CH3)CH2CH2N(CH3)—, the linker may be partially cleaved such that group —C(O)N(CH3)CH2CH2NHCH3 remains bound to the compound. In other embodiments, the cleavable linker is pH-sensitive. Typically, the pH-sensitive linker is unstable and degrades under acidic conditions. For example, an acid-labile linker that is cleavable in the lysosome (e.g., a hydrazone, semicarbazone, thiosemicarbazone, cis-aconitic amide, orthoester, acetal, ketal, or the like) can be used. (See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,122,368; 5,824,805; 5,622,929; Dubowchik and Walker (1999) Pharm. Therapeutics 83:67-123; Neville et al. (1989) Biol. Chem. 264:14653-14661.) Such linkers are relatively stable under neutral pH conditions, such as those in the blood, but are unstable at below pH 5.5 or 5.0, the approximate pH of the lysosome. Typically, the linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment. As used herein, “not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment,” in the context of a linker, means that no more than about 20%, 15%, 10%, 5%, or 1% of the linkers, in a sample of compound-ligand conjugate compound, are cleaved when the antibody-drug conjugate compound is in an extracellular environment. Whether a linker is not substantially sensitive to the extracellular environment can be determined using methods known to those of skill in the relevant art. In some embodiments, the linker contains a spacer unit. In some embodiments, the spacer unit contains a para-aminobenzoate (PAB) moiety. In some embodiments, the linker contains a stretcher unit. In some embodiments, the stretcher unit contains a maleimide moiety. In some embodiments, the linking groups will be bifunctional, meaning they comprise two reactive sites, wherein a first reactive site may be bound to the compounds described herein and the second reactive site may be bound to the ligand. The linker may be hetero-bifunctional, indicating that the binding moieties on either end of the linker moiety are different. In some embodiments, conjugates of the ligand and compound are made using a variety of bifunctional protein-coupling agents such as N-succinimidyl-3-(2-pyridyldithiol) propionate (SPDP), iminothiolane (IT), bifunctional derivatives of imidoesters (such as dimethyl adipimidate HCl), active esters (such as disuccinimidyl suberate), aldehydes (such as glutaraldehyde), bis-azido compounds (such as bis (p-azidoberizoyl) hexanediamine), bis-diazonium derivatives (such as bis-(p-diazoniumbenzoyl)-ethylenediamine), diisocyanates (such as toluene 2,6-diisocyanate), and bis-active fluorine compounds (such as 1,5-difluoro-2,4-dinitrobenzene). For example, a ricin immunotoxin can be prepared as described in Vitetta et al (1987) Science, 238:1098. Carbon-14-labeled 1 -isothiocyanatobenzyl-3-methyldiethylene triaminepentaacetic acid (MX-DTPA) is an exemplary chelating agent for conjugation of radionucleotide to the compound or ligand (WO94/11026). The compounds described herein can be linked to ligands via an acid labile linker as previously described (Blattler et al, 24 Biochemistry, 1517-1524 (1985), U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,542,225, 4,569,789 and 4,764,368). The compounds described herein can be linked to ligands via a photolabile linker as previously described (Senter et al, 42 Photochemistry and Photobiology, 231-237 (1985), U.S. Pat. No. 4,625,014). The compounds described herein can be linked to a ligand to produce a conjugate that can be cleaved by intracellular esterases to liberate free drug. (For examples see: U.S. Pat. No. 5,208,020 and Aboud-Pirak et al, 38 Biochem. Pharmacol., 641-648 (1989), Laguzza et al, 32 J. Med. Chem., 549-555 (1989)). The compounds described herein can also be linked to ligands via peptide spacer linkers. It has been previously shown that short peptide spacers between drugs and macromolecular carriers are stable in serum but are readily hydrolyzed by intracellular lysosomal peptidases (Trouet et al, 79 Proc. Nat'l. Acad. Sci. 626-629 (1982)). Functional groups on the compound that can serve as a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand using the coupling methods described herein include, without limitation, —OH, —NHR, —NHNH2, —ONH2, —SH, —CO2H, and other functional groups. In any of the variations of Formulae (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), and (Ie) described herein, the compound may be modified to contain one or more functional groups that can serve as a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand at any chemically feasible position. In some embodiments, any of the variations of Formulae (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), and (Ic) may contain one or more moieties selected from the group consisting of —OH, —NHR, —NHNH2, —ONH2, —N3, —SH, —CO2H at any chemically feasible position. In some embodiments, a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand can be located on an amino acid side chain. In other embodiments, a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand can be located at position Y4. In other embodiments, a handle for attachment of a linker or ligand can be located at positions R2, R8a, R8b, R15, or R4. In some variations the linker is of formula (L-Fn), where the linker is bonded to a compound provided herein via the bond shown as

General Synthetic Methods Compounds of Formula (I) will now be described by reference to illustrative synthetic schemes for their general preparation below and the specific examples that follow. Artisans will recognize that, to obtain the various compounds herein, starting materials may be suitably selected so that the ultimately desired substituents will be carried through the reaction scheme with or without protection as appropriate to yield the desired product. Alternatively, it may be necessary or desirable to employ, in the place of the ultimately desired substituent, a suitable group that may be carried through the reaction scheme and replaced as appropriate with the desired substituent. In addition, one of skill in the art will recognize that protecting groups may be used to protect certain functional groups (amino, carboxy, or side chain groups) from reaction conditions, and that such groups are removed under standard conditions when appropriate. Unless otherwise specified, the variables are as defined above in reference to Formula (I). Where it is desired to obtain a particular enantiomer of a compound, this may be accomplished from a corresponding mixture of enantiomers using any suitable conventional procedure for separating or resolving enantiomers. Thus, for example, diastereomeric derivatives may be produced by reaction of a mixture of enantiomers, e.g. a racemate, and an appropriate chiral compound. The diastereomers may then be separated by any convenient means, for example by crystallization and the desired enantiomer recovered. In another resolution process, a racemate may be separated using chiral High Performance Liquid Chromatography. Alternatively, if desired a particular enantiomer may be obtained by using an appropriate chiral intermediate in one of the processes described. Chromatography, recrystallization and other conventional separation procedures may also be used with intermediates or final products where it is desired to obtain a particular isomer of a compound or to otherwise purify a product of a reaction. General methods of preparing compounds described herein are depicted in exemplified methods below. Variable groups in the schemes provided herein are defined as for Formula (I), (Ia), (Ib), (Ic), (Id), (Ie), (II), (IIa), (IIb), (IIc), (IId), (IIe), (III), (IIIa), (IIIb), (IIIc), (IIId), (IIIe), (IV), (IVa), (IVb), (IVc), (IVd), (IVe), or any variation thereof. Other compounds described herein may be prepared by similar methods. For example, Scheme 1b is an exemplified synthesis of the method detailed in Scheme 1a, but other compounds described herein may be prepared by similar methods.

Example 70 Synthesis of Conjugates C24, C25, and C26 The antibody-drug conjugates C24-26, wherein Ab is Trastuzumab Biosimilar (TBS) antibody, were synthesized using protocols similar to methods described previously (Ref: Bryant, P. et al, Mol. Pharmaceuticals, 2015, 12, 1872-1879). Briefly, the purified antibody, Trastuzumab Biosimilar (TBS, 1-2 mg) was buffer exchanged with PBS (1× solution, pH 7.5) and EDTA (20 mM) mix and diluted to a final concentration of 2.5 mg/mL. A stock solution of TCEP (1 mM) was freshly prepared in PBS, and 6 molar equiv. (relative to the antibody concentration) was added to the antibody and left the mixture on a heat block. After 1 h, the partially reduced antibody was removed from the heat block and cooled to room temperature. A stock solution of Conjugate L24, L25, and L26 (5 mM in DMSO) was freshly prepared, and 6-8 molar equiv was added to the antibody. The reaction was incubated at RT for 15-20 h under mild agitation. Then the reaction mixture was passed through a spin column (Zeba, 2 mL) to remove small MW reagents and buffer exchanged by ultrafiltration (10 kDa MWCO) into PBS to afford the ADC, C24-C27 in PBS. The resulting ADC had an average DAR around 4 by HIC. The aggregation was measured by Size Exclusion Chromatography (SEC) and it was less than 1%. Example 71 Synthesis of Conjugates C29 and C31 The antibody-drug conjugates C29 and C31 is synthesized from L29 and L31 respectively, using protocols similar to methods described previously (Ref Doronina, S. O. et al, Bioconjugate Chem. 2008, 19 (10), 1960-1963). Example B1 Inhibitory Response of Test Compounds Against BT-474 and HCC1954 Cells BT-474 human mammary gland ductal carcinoma cells were seeded in a clear polystyrene 96-well microculture plate (Corning® Costar® 96-well flat bottom plate, Cat. #3997) in a total volume of 90 μL/well. After 24 hours of incubation in a humidified incubator at 37° C. with 5% CO2 and 95% air, 10 μL of 10×, serially diluted test agents in growth medium were added to each well (10 pt dose response curve, highest concentration 10 μM of test agent). After 72 hours of culture in a humidified incubator at 37° C., in an atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air, the plated cells and Cell Titer-Glo® (Protnega G7571) reagents were brought to room temperature to equilibrate for 30 minutes. 100 μL of Cell Titer-Glo® reagent was added to each well. The plate was shaken for two minutes and then left to equilibrate for ten minutes. The media/Cell Titer-Glo® reagent was transferred to a white polystyrene 96-well microculture plate (Corning® Costar® 96-well flat bottom plate, Cat. #3917) before reading luminescence on a Tecan GENios microplate reader. Percent inhibition of cell growth was calculated relative to untreated control wells. The IC50 value for the test agents was determined using Prism 6.05 by curve-fitting of the data using the following four parameter-logistic equation:

No. 15/876,181, presently pending, which is a continuation of U.S. application Ser. No. 14/350,322, now issued as U.S. Pat. No. 9,872,843, which is a national stage entry application of international appl. PCT/US2012/059263, filed 8 Oct. 2012, which claims the benefit of U.S. patent appl. nos. 61/545,108, filed 8 Oct. 2011, and 61/660,649, filed 15 Jun. 2012, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference. BACKGROUND INFORMATION Microbes are found virtually everywhere, often in high concentrations, and are responsible for a significant amount of disease and infection. Killing and/or eliminating these microorganisms is desirable for a variety of reasons. Bacteria present special challenges because they can exist in a number of forms (e.g., planktonic, spore and biofilm) and their self preservation mechanisms make them extremely difficult to treat and/or eradicate. For example, the bacteria in biofilms or spores are down-regulated (sessile) and not actively dividing, which makes them resistant to attack by a large group of antibiotics and antimicrobials that attack the bacteria during the active parts of their lifecycle, e.g., cell division. In a biofilm, bacteria interact with and adhere to surfaces and form colonies which facilitate continued growth. The bacteria produce exopolysaccharide (EPS) and/or extracellularpolysaccharide (ECPS) macromolecules that keep them attached to the surface and form a protective barrier effective against many forms of attack. Protection most likely can be attributed to the small diameter of the flow channels in the matrix, which restricts the size of molecules that can reach the underlying bacteria, and consumption of biocides through interactions with portions of the EPS/ECPS macromolecular matrix and bacterial secretions and waste products contained therein. (Certain fungi also can form biofilms, many of which present the same types of challenges presented here.) Bacteria also can form spores, which are hard, non-permeable protein/poly-saccharide shells or coatings. Spores provide additional resistance to eradication efforts by preventing attack from materials that are harmful to the bacteria. Due to the protection afforded by a macromolecular matrix (biofilm) or shell (spore) and their down-regulated state, bacteria in these states are very difficult to treat. The types of biocides and antimicrobials effective in treating bacteria in this form are strongly acidic and/or oxidizing, often involving halogen atoms, oxygen atoms, or both. Common examples include hypochlorite solutions (e.g., bleach), phenolics, mineral acids (e.g., HCl), H2O2, and the like. Large dosages of such chemicals must be allowed to contact the biofilm or spore for extended amounts of time to be effective, which makes them impractical for many applications. Recently developed formulations intended for use in connection with compromised animal/human tissue solvate a biofilm matrix so that still-living bacteria can be rinsed or otherwise removed from infected tissue; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,976,873, 7,976,875, 7,993,675, etc. The concentrations of active ingredients in these formulations are too low to effectively kill the bacteria, however, thus making such formulations ill suited for use as surface disinfectants. Neutral-to-very acidic disinfecting solutions that can disrupt macromolecular matrices, or bypass and/or disable their inherent defenses, allowing ingredients in the solutions to access the bacteria, attack cell membranes, and kill them have been described in U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2010/0086576 A1. Animal tissue wounds present both a good environment for bacterial, and even biofilm, growth and a surface or substrate requiring gentle treatment, thus making a difficult problem even worse. Dental plaque, a biofilm that adheres to a tooth surface, consists of bacterial cells (mainly Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis), salivary polymers and bacterial extracellular products. The accumulation of microorganisms subject the teeth and gingival tissues to high concentrations of bacterial metabolites, which results in widespread problems such as gingivitis and periodontal disease, including oral caries. Nosocomial or hospital acquired infections (HAIs) can be caused by viral, bacterial, and/or fungal pathogens and can involve any system of the body. HAIs are a leading cause of patient deaths, and they increase the length of hospitalizations for patients, mortality and healthcare costs; in the developed world, they are estimated to occur in 5-10% of all hospitalizations, even higher for pediatric and neonatal patients. They often are associated with medical devices or blood product transfusions. Three major sites of HAIs are bloodstream, respiratory tract, and urinary tract. Most patients who have HAIs have invasive supportive measures such as central intravenous lines, mechanical ventilation, and catheters, which provide an ingress point for pathogenic organisms. Ventilator-associated pneumonia can be caused by Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Clostridium difficile, and Tuberculosis, while other HAIs include urinary tract infections, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Legionellosis. Medical equipment such as endoscopes, gastroscopes, the flow-channels of hematology and dialyzer equipment, the airflow path of respiratory equipment, ISE, HPLC, and certain catheters are designed to be used multiple times. Significant risks have been associated with inadequate or improper cleaning due to the presence of residual soil and/or improper disinfection or sterilization, up to and including HAIs from contaminated devices such as bronchoscopes contaminated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the transmission of Hepatitis C virus to patients during colonoscopy procedures. Any surface that is or becomes moist is subject to biofilm formation. Thus, articles intended for permanent or temporary implantation—such as artificial hearts, stents, contact lenses, intrauterine devices, artificial joints, dental implants—are particularly susceptible. Extreme measures are taken to prevent biofilm formation because, once established, they are essentially impossible to eradicate in vivo and can cause life-altering, even lethal, infections. Compositions and articles that can be used in the treatment of microbes such as bacteria remain desirable. Liquids that break down the EPS/EPCS macromolecular matrix or that bypass and/or disable the defenses inherent in therein, thereby permitting the liquid or a component thereof to access and kill the bacteria in a down-regulated state, are particularly desirable. Such a liquid that is lethally effective while having no or very limited toxicity is of significant interest and commercial value. Methods and articles capable of treating bacteria that colonize acute wounds at the time of injury and during all stages of healing, as well as in the treatment of chronic wounds, also are highly desirable. Also of significant interest are methods, compositions capable of treating and/or remedying any of a variety of oral and mucosal conditions associated with biofilms; preventing or remedying HAIs and/or biofilms in which the microorganisms can be entrained; preventing the growth of or removing biofilms from implantable (or implanted) devices and articles; and sterilizing or otherwise processing multiuse medical equipment. SUMMARY The present invention is directed to compositions and articles that can be used in treatment or elimination of microbes including but not limited to bacteria, regardless of whether they are in planktonic, spore, or biofilm form. An aqueous composition according to the present invention is lethal toward a wide spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria and exhibits lethality toward other microbes such as viruses, fungi, molds, yeasts, and bacterial spores. In addition to having a pH greater than 7, the composition includes a significant amount of one or more surfactants and large amounts of osmotically active solutes. The composition is effective at interrupting or breaking ionic crosslinks in the macromolecular matrix of a biofilm, which facilitates passage of the solutes and surfactant through the matrix to the bacteria entrained therein and/or protected thereby. These ingredients, while typically ineffective against bacteria when used in isolation or at low concentrations, become very effective at breaking down the bacterial biofilm or bypassing and disabling the bacterial biofilm defenses, allowing the bacteria in its several states to be accessed and killed (by inducing membrane leakage in bacteria, leading to cell lysis) when provided in the correct combination and in sufficient concentrations. Articles, compositions and methods for treating wound areas also are provided. Non-solid compositions can be applied to the area; the composition can be non-flowing if it is intended to be left in place or can be a liquid if it is intended to irrigate or otherwise flow over or around a treatment area. A solid article can be applied to a wound treatment area; such an article can be adapted to be left in place on or near the treatment area or can be intended for temporary application and removal. An antihemorrhagic can be included in a composition or article to permit the composition or article to stanch bleeding, in addition to providing antimicrobial treatment. These aspects also provide methods of cleaning, dressing and otherwise treating wounds. Also provided are articles, compositions, and methods for protecting against or treating microbial attack of the mouth, teeth, gums, lips, oral mucosal lining, particularly attack by biofilm-related conditions including, but not limited to, oral caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, halitosis, and peri-implantitis. Further, HAIs can be prevented or remedied by applying a liquid or solid antimicrobial composition to a surface located in a medical treatment facility so as to prevent or remove a biofilm and/or kill bacterial entrained therein. A patient possessing a HAI also can be treated with an antimicrobial composition or an article including or based thereon. Additionally, the surfaces of permanently or removably implantable objects can be treated so as to prevent biofilm formation or, after implantation, can be treated to remove biofilm on such surfaces. Reusable medical equipment also can be processed so as to remove EPS/ECPS, materials conducive to the growth of EPS/ECPS, and organisms that are or can be entrained in EPS/ECPS. The processing can involve sterilization or can supplement existing sterilization techniques and results in medical equipment that is less likely to introduce microbes, particularly bacteria, into a patient treated therewith.

 Hereinthroughout, pH values are those which can be obtained from any of a variety of potentiometric techniques employing a properly calibrated electrode. The relevant portions of any specifically referenced patent and/or published patent application are incorporated herein by reference. DETAILED DESCRIPTION Useful basic (caustic) liquid compositions display at least moderately high tonicity, i.e., large amounts of osmotically active solutes and a pH that is relatively high (7.5≤pH≤9) or even very high (9≤pH≤11). The large amount of solutes work with surfactants that are present to induce membrane leakage in bacteria, leading to cell lysis. The composition can contain as few as three ingredients: water, the dissociation product(s) of at least one base, and at least one surfactant, each of which generally is considered to be biocompatible. The dissociation product(s) of one or more salts also can be included. Reductions in the concentration of hydronium ions, i.e., increases in pH, generally correspond with enhanced efficacy. This effect may not be linear, i.e., the enhancement in efficacy may be asymptotic below a certain hydronium ion concentration. As long as the pH of the composition is greater than 7 and less than ˜10, the basic composition generally will be considered to be biocompatible; specifically, external exposure will result in no long-term negative dermal effects. Basicity is achieved by adding to water (or vice versa) one or more bases such as, but not limited to, alkali metal salts of weak acids including acetates, fulmates, lactates, phosphates, and glutamates; alkali metal nitrates; alkali metal hydroxides, in particular NaOH and KOH; alkali earth metal hydroxides, in particular Mg(OH)2; alkali metal borates; NH3; and alkali metal hypochlorites (e.g., NaClO) and bicarbonates (e.g., NaHCO3). In certain embodiments, preference can be given to those organic compounds which are, or can be made to be, highly soluble in water. In these and/or other embodiments, preference can be given to those bases which are biocompatible. Alternatively or additionally, preference can be given to those organic acids and bases which can act to chelate the metallic cations ionic involved in crosslinking the macromolecular matrix of a biofilm. Surfactant can be added to water before, after or at the same time as the base(s). Essentially any material having surface active properties in water can be employed, although those that bear some type of ionic charge are expected to have enhanced antimicrobial efficacy because such charges, when brought into contact with a bacteria, are believed to lead to more effective cell membrane disruption and, ultimately, to cell leakage and lysis. This type of antimicrobial process can kill even sessile bacteria because it does not involve or entail disruption of a cellular process. Potentially useful anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, sodium chenodeoxycholate, N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt, lithium dodecyl sulfate, 1-octanesulfonic acid sodium salt, sodium cholate hydrate, sodium deoxycholate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium glycodeoxycholate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and the alkyl phosphates set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,610,314. Potentially useful cationic surfactants include, but are not limited to, cetylpyridinium chloride, tetradecyltrimethylammonium borime, benzalkonium chloride, hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, with the latter being a preferred material. Potentially useful nonionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, polyoxy-ethyleneglycol dodecyl ether, N-decanoyl-N-methylglucamine, digitonin, n-dodecyl B-D-maltoside, octyl B-D-glucopyranoside, octylphenol ethoxylate, polyoxyethylene (8) isooctyl phenyl ether, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, and polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan mono-oleate. Useful zwitterionic surfactants include but are not limited to 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propane sulfonate, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate, 3-(decyldimethylammonio) propanesulfonate inner salt, and N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate. For other potentially useful materials, the interested reader is directed to any of a variety of other sources including, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,107,328, 6,953,772, and 7,959,943. Particular classes and types of surfactants can be preferred for certain end use applications, with some of these being specifically referenced later in this document. The composition contains a sufficient amount of surfactant to interrupt or rupture bacterial cell walls. The amount of surfactant constitutes greater than ˜0.075%, ˜0.10%, ˜0.125%, ˜0.15% or ˜0.175%, generally at least ˜0.2%, typically at least ˜0.5%, more typically at least ˜0.7%, often at least ˜0.9%, and preferably at least 1% of the composition (all being weight percentages based on total weight of the composition), with the upper limit being defined by the solubility limits of the particular surfactant(s) chosen. Some surfactants can permit extremely high loading levels, e.g., at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 12%, at least 15%, at least 17%, at least 20%, or even on the order of ˜25% or more (again, all being weight percentages based on total weight of the composition). Any of the foregoing minimum amounts can be combined with any of the foregoing maximum amounts to provide an exemplary range of potential amounts of surfactant. Ionically charged compounds that do not qualify as a surfactants might be able to replace some or all of the surfactant component in some instances. Ionically charged compounds include natural polymers such as chitosan and glucosides, as well as charged molecules and atoms such as such as Cl−, Na+, NH4+, HCO3−, SO4−2, HSO4−, S2O3−2, SO3−2, OH−, NO3−, ClO4−, CrO4−2, Cr2O7−2, MnO4−2, PO4−3, HPO4−2, H2PO4−, and the like. These types of ions also can increase the osmolarity of a composition without increasing its pH past a desired target; see also, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,090,882. Such compounds, upon dissociation, increase the effective amount of solutes in the composition without greatly impacting the molar concentration of hydroxyl ions while, in some cases, simultaneously providing a buffer system in the composition. The lethality of the surfactant component(s) is increased and/or enhanced when the composition has at least moderate effective solute concentrations (tonicity). The osmolarity of the composition generally increases in proportion with the amount of base(s) employed, with the osmolarity maximum for a given composition primarily being a function of the solubility limits of the specific base(s). An obvious corollary to increased levels of base(s) in the composition is lower concentrations of hydronium ions, i.e., high pH values. As noted previously, some end-use applications can call for a composition with only a moderately high pH. To increase the osmolarity of a composition without increasing its pH past a desired target, one or more types of other water soluble compounds can be included. Such compounds, upon dissociation, increase the effective amount of solutes in the composition without greatly impacting the molar concentration of hydroxyl ions while, simultaneously, providing a buffer system in the composition. The ionically charged molecules and atoms discussed above are among those materials which can serve this function; see also, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,090,882. Regardless of how achieved, the tonicity of the composition is at least moderately high, with an osmolarity of at least ˜0.3, ˜0.5, ˜0.7, ˜0.8, ˜0.9 or ˜1 Osm/L being preferred for most applications. Depending on particular end-use application, the composition can have any of the following concentrations: at least ˜1.5 Osm, at least ˜1.75 Osm/L, at least ˜2.0 Osm/L, at least ˜2.25 Osm/L, at least ˜2.5 Osm/L, at least ˜2.75 Osm/L, at least ˜3.0 Osm/L, at least ˜3.25 Osm/L, at least ˜3.5 Osm/L, at least ˜3.75 Osm/L, at least ˜4.0 Osm/L, and even at least ˜4.25 Osm/L. Certain embodiments of the composition can exhibit solute concentrations of 0.3 to 5 Osm/L, 0.5 to 4.5 Osm/L, 0.75 to 4.4 Osm/L, 1 to 4.3 Osm/L, 1.25 to 4.25 Osm/L, 1.4 to 4.1 Osm/L, and 1.5 to 4 Osm/L; other potentially useful ranges include 3 to 5 Osm/L, 2.5 to 4.5 Osm/L, 3 to 4.5 Osm/L, 3.5 to 5 Osm/L, 3.25 to 4.5 Osm/L, and the like. The composition can be employed in a variety of ways. For example, when used to treat a biofilm on a surface (e.g., cutting board, counter, desk, etc.), the composition can be applied directly to the biofilm, optionally followed by physical rubbing or buffing, or the composition can be applied to the rubbing/buffing medium, e.g., cloth. Where a biofilm in an inaccessible area is to be treated, soaking or immersion of the biofilm in an excess of the composition can be performed for a time sufficient to essentially solvate the biofilm, which then can be flushed or wiped from the affected area. Regardless of contact method, the surfactant compo-nent(s) are believed to kill significant numbers of bacteria without a need for the bacteria to be removed from the biofilm or vice versa. Due to the abundance of microbial contamination, the composition may find utility in a large number of potential uses including, but not limited to, household applications including non-compromised skin (hand, foot, hair, and body washing and/or deodorization), kitchen cleaning (countertop and surface cleaning, cleaning of food preparation utensils, dish washing, produce washing, etc.), bathroom cleaning (countertop and surface cleaning, fixture cleaning, toilet bowl cleaning, sink and floor drain cleaning, and shower mildew eradication), laundry area cleaning (including laundry detergent, linen disinfection, and diaper sterilization), baby sensitive applications such as cleaning and or disinfecting baby contact products (including toys, bottles, pacifiers, nipples, teething rings, diapers, blankets, and clothing); commercial applications include livestock care (facility and equipment sterilization and dairy teat dip), produce sterilization (an alternative to irradiation, which can be particularly useful against E. coli, listeria, salmonella, botulism, etc.), meat and poultry processing facilities (including all surfaces, floors and drains, processing equipment and carcass washing), commercial kitchen and food preparation facilities (countertop and surface cleaning, food preparation utensil cleaning, storage equipment and facilities cleaning, dish washing and produce washing), mass food and beverage processing (processing and storage equipment cleaning, tank sterilization, cleaning of liquid transport lines, etc.), cleaning of water lines (e.g., for drinking water, beverage dispensers, dental offices, plumbing, heat exchanging systems, and the like), and food and beverage transport (cleaning of tanker units for semi transport, cleaning of tanker cars for railroad transport, and cleaning of pipelines); and non-traditional uses such as denture cleaning, acne treatment, spermi-cides, laboratory equipment cleaning, laboratory surface cleaning, oil pipeline cleaning, and test article processing for biofilm attachment. The composition can be prepared in a number of ways. Description of an exemplary method follows. Base (e.g., NaOH) and optional solute (e.g., a phosphate or sulfate) are combined with sufficient water to constitute 60-90% of the calculated desired volume. This solution can be stirred and/or heated. The desired amount of surfactant(s) then can be added. Once stirring, if used, is complete, sufficient water is added so as to bring the composition to the calculated tonicity and pH value. Advantageously, no special conditions or containers are needed to store the composition for an extended time, although refrigeration can be used if desired. A variety of additives and adjuvants can be included to make a composition more amenable for use in a particular end-use application without negatively affecting its efficacy in a substantial manner. Examples include, but are not limited to, emollients, fungicides, fragrances, pigments, dyes, defoamers, foaming agents, flavors, abrasives, bleaching agents, preservatives (e.g., antioxidants) and the like. The composition does not require inclusion of an active antimicrobial agent for efficacy, but such materials can be included in certain embodiments. For example, one or more of bleach, any of a variety of phenols, aldehydes, quaternary ammonium compounds, etc., can be added. The composition conveniently can be provided as a solution, although other forms might be desirable for certain end-use applications. Accordingly, the composition can provided as a soluble powder (for subsequent dilution, an option which can reduce transportation costs), a slurry, or a thicker form such as a gel or paste (which might be particularly useful for providing increased residence times). For the latter, the composition can include additional ingredients such as a coalescent (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone). Embodiments of the composition can provide very large reductions in the number of bacteria, even with extremely short residence times. For example, a composition having high concentrations of surfactant (e.g., 1.5-2.5% by wt.) and total solutes (e.g., 2-4 Osm/L) can provide a 2, 3 or 4 log (99.99%) reduction in the number of bacteria in an entrenched biofilm with a 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, or 10 minute residence time and a 3, 4, 5, or 6 log (99.9999%) reduction in the number of planktonic bacteria with a mere 30-second residence time. Quantitative Carrier Testing (ASTM E2197) is designed to determine the contact time necessary to eradicate from a surface (e.g., countertops, sinks, bathroom fixtures, and the like) bacteria in a soil-loaded inoculum. In this test, bacteria combined with a soil loading and a 10 μL inoculum is placed on a stainless steel carrier disk. After the inoculate is allowed to dry completely, 50 μL of antimicrobial treatment composition is applied and allowed to stay in place for the desired treatment time, after which dilution with a saline dilution is performed. In addition to the foregoing general uses for the caustic composition of the present invention, certain specific end uses can employ the caustic antimicrobial composition, its acidic counterpart or, in some instances, a solid antimicrobial material. The following paragraphs set forth information about an acidic antimicrobial composition and a solid antimicrobial material, as well as specific novel end uses for such compositions and materials. Potentially useful acidic liquid compositions include those described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,976,873, 7,976,875, and 7,993,675 as well as U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2010/0086576 A1, all of which include large amounts of osmotically active solutes. A primary difference among the liquid compositions is pH, with those intended for use in the ear or sinus cavity being very moderate (e.g., commonly about 6≤pH≤7), and those intended for surface disinfection being more extreme, e.g., relatively low (about 3≤pH≤6). An acidic antimicrobial composition can contain as few as three ingredients: water, the dissociation product(s) of at least one acid, and at least one surfactant, each of which generally is considered to be biocompatible. The dissociation product(s) of one or more alkali metal salts of organic acids also can be included. Increases in the concentration of hydronium ions, i.e., decreases in pH, generally correspond with enhanced efficacy and, again, the effect may not be linear, i.e., the enhancement in efficacy may be asymptotic past a certain hydronium ion concentration. As long as the pH of the composition is greater than ˜3, the composition generally will be biocompatible; specifically, external exposure will result in no long-term negative dermal effects. Acidity is achieved by adding to water (or vice versa) one or more acids, specifically strong (mineral) acids such as HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4, HNO3, H3BO3, and the like or, preferably, organic acids, particularly organic polyacids. Examples of organic acids include mono-protic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid and substituted variants, propanoic acid and substituted variants (e.g., lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and the like), any of a variety of benzoic acids (e.g., mandelic acid, chloromandelic acid, salicylic acid, and the like), glucuronic acid, and the like; diprotic acids such as oxalic acid and substituted variants (including oxamic acid), butanedioic acid and substituted variants (e.g., malic acid, aspartic acid, tartaric acid, citramalic acid, and the like), pentanedioic acid and substituted variants (e.g., glutamic acid, 2-ketoglutaric acid, and the like), hexanedioic acid and substituted variants (e.g., mucic acid), butenedioic acid (both cis and trans isomers), iminodiacetic acid, phthalic acid, ketopimelic acid, and the like; triprotic acids such as citric acid, 2-methylpropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid, benzenetricarboxylic acid, nitrilo-triacetic acid, and the like; tetraprotic acids such as prehnitic acid, pyromellitic acid, and the like; and even higher degree acids (e.g., penta-, hexa-, heptaprotic, etc.). Where a tri-, tetra-, or higher acid is used, one or more of the carboxyl protons can be replaced by cationic atoms or groups (e.g., alkali metal ions), which can be the same or different. In certain embodiments, preference can be given to those organic acids which are, or can be made to be, highly soluble in water; acids that include groups that enhance solubility in water (e.g., hydroxyl groups), examples of which include tartaric acid, citric acid, and citramalic acid, can be preferred in some circumstances. In these and/or other embodiments, preference can be given to those organic acids which are biocompatible; many of the organic acids listed above are used in preparing or treating food products, personal care products, and the like. Alternatively or additionally, preference can be given to those organic acids which can act to chelate the metallic cations ionic involved in crosslinking the macromolecular matrix of a biofilm. This is discussed in more detail below. Surfactant can be added to water before, after or at the same time as the acid(s). As with the basic antimicrobial composition, those surfactants that bear some type of ionic charge are expected to yield enhanced antimicrobial efficacy; such charges, when brought into contact with a bacterium, are believed to lead to more effective cell membrane disruption and, ultimately, to cell leakage and lysis. Potentially useful surfactants are the same as those described previously, with non-ionic and cationic surfactants being at least somewhat preferred where the composition is intended for contact with dermal tissue. The amounts of such surfactants that can be employed in the acidic antimicrobial composition are the same as those described above in connection with the basic antimicrobial composition. The lethality of the surfactant component(s) is increased and/or enhanced when the composition has at least moderate effective solute concentrations (tonicity). The osmolarity of the composition generally increases in proportion with the amount of acid(s) employed, with the osmolarity maximum for a given composition primarily being a function of the solubility limits of the specific acid(s). An obvious corollary to increased levels of acid(s) in the composition is higher concentrations of hydronium ions, i.e., low pH values. As noted previously, some end-use applications can call for a composition with only a moderately low pH. To increase the osmolarity of a composition without decreasing its pH past a desired target, one or more types of other water soluble compounds can be included. Such compounds, upon dissociation, increase the effective amount of solutes in the composition without greatly impacting the molar concentration of hydronium ions while, simultaneously, providing a buffer system in the composition. The materials and methods for enhancing tonicity, as well as the osmolarities of the resulting compositions, are the same as those described above in connection with the basic antimicrobial composition. Where one or more organic acids are used in the composition, tonicity can be increased by including salt(s) of those acid(s) or other acid(s). For example, where the composition includes x moles of an acid, a many fold excess (e.g., 3×-10×, preferably at least 5× or even at least 8×) of one or more salts of that acid also can be included. Both the basic and acidic antimicrobial liquid compositions have been described primarily as solutions, although this is not limiting. Additional forms include emulsions, gels (including hydrogels, organogels and xerogels), pastes (i.e., suspension in an organic, typically fatty, base), salves or ointments, aerosols, foams, and even suspensions. Solid articles intended for use in disinfecting applications are described in U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2012/0288469 A1. Solid materials include a crosslinked version of a water soluble polyelectrolyte and entrained surfactant. This combination of components permits the local chemistry within and immediately surrounding the solid material, when in use in an aqueous environment, to mimic that of the acidic versions of the aforedescribed liquid composition: high tonicity and high surfactant concentration. The solid material can, but need not, include biocidal additives, particularly active antimicrobial agents. When a liquid is passed through or in proximity to the solid material, any bacteria or other microorganisms are exposed to the local chemistry conditions discussed above: high tonicity, relatively low pH, and available surfactant, a combination that can induce membrane leakage in bacteria, leading to cell lysis. These characteristics permit the solid material to be effective at bypassing and disabling bacterial biofilm and spore defenses. In addition to being lethal toward a wide spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria, the solid materials also can exhibit lethality toward other microbes such as viruses, fungi, molds, and yeasts. The solid material requires some level of water or humidity to function effectively. This can be determined or defined in a variety of ways. The polyelectrolytes must be capable of localized liquid charge interaction (meaning at least two water molecules are contacting or very near an electrolyte group); alternatively, sufficient water must be present to activate the charge of the electrolyte and/or permit bacterial growth. A solid antimicrobial material does not itself have a true pH. In use, however, the local pH of any aqueous composition in which it is deployed preferably is lower than ˜7 to ensure proper antimicrobial activity. Reduced pH values (e.g., less than ˜6.5, ˜6.0, ˜5.5, ˜5.0, ˜4.5 and even ˜4.0) generally are believed to correlate with increases in efficacy of the solid material, although this effect might be asymptotic for reasons described above. In addition to more strongly acidic local environments, high local osmolarity conditions also are believed to increase efficacy. Accordingly, larger concentrations of polyelectrolytes, larger concentrations of surfactant, surfactants with shorter chain lengths (e.g., no more than C10, typically no more than C8, commonly no more than C6), and surfactants with smaller side groups around the polar group each are more desirable. (These factors also are applicable to the previously described liquid compositions.) The lethality of the surfactant component(s) is increased and/or enhanced when the solid material can provide to the local environment in which it is deployed at least moderate effective solute concentrations, similar to that described above. Local osmolarity (tonicity) generally increases in proportion to the number and type of electrolytes present in the polymeric network. (By local osmolarity is meant that of a liquid contained in the solid material. While this might vary from place to place throughout the article, preference is given to those solid materials capable of providing high local osmolarities throughout.) The polyelectrolyte(s) that form the bulk of the solid material preferably are at least somewhat water soluble but also essentially water insoluble after being crosslinked. A partial list of polyelectrolytes having this combination of characteristics includes, but are not limited to, strong polyelectrolytes such as polysodium styrene sulfonate and weak polyelectrolytes such as polyacrylic acid, pectin, carrageenan, any of a variety of alginates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carboxymethylchitosan, and carboxymethylcellulose. Included in potentially useful poly-amphyolytes are amino acids and betaine-type crosslinked networks; examples would be hydrogels based on sodium acrylate and trimethylmethacryloyloxyethylammonium iodide, 2-hydroxy-ethylmethacrylate, or 1-vinyl-3(3-sulfopropyl)imidazolium betaine. Those polymeric materials having electrolyte groups that completely (or nearly completely) dissociate in water and/or provide relatively low local pH values are desired for efficacy are preferred. Also preferred are those polyelectrolytes having a high density of mer with electrolyte-containing side groups. Several crosslinking mechanisms including but not limited to chemical, high temperature self-crosslinking, and irradiation can be employed in forming the solid material. Another option is to create crosslinks during the polymerization process itself, such as by con-densing adjacent sulfonic acid groups to yield sulfonyl crosslinks. Solid materials with higher crosslink densities tend to maintain higher surfactant concentrations for a longer period of time due to, presumably, longer mean free paths in the polymeric network. Independent of crosslinking method, the solid material can be formed by crosslinking polymers (or polymerizable monomers) in an aqueous solution contained in a heat conductive mold, followed by rapid freezing and subsequent lyophilizing. The resulting sponge-like material generally takes the shape of the mold in which it was formed. Solids resulting from this type of process often have a spongy appearance, with relatively large pores connected by tortuous paths. Often, pores less than ˜0.22 μm, less than ˜0.45 μm, less than ˜0.80 μm, and less than ˜0.85 μm are desirable (based on the diameters of endotoxins, bacteria, and spores); for these and other applications, a solid material with at least some larger pores (e.g., less than ˜1, 2, 5, 10, 50, or 100 μm) can be used. The solid material contains a sufficient amount of surfactant to interrupt or rupture cell walls of bacteria contacting or coming into the vicinity of the solid material. The surfactant component(s) generally constitute as low as ˜0.03% and as high as ˜10%, ˜15% or even ˜17.5% (all by wt.) of the solid material. The same types of surface active materials discussed previously also can be used in this form. The surfactant preferably is present in the polymer network at the time that crosslinking occurs (or the time of polymerization in the case of the type of simultaneous polymerization and condensation discussed above). If it is not, a crosslinked polymer article or film must be post-treated to ensure proper entrainment of the surfactant. A possible method for accomplishing this is immersion of the article or film in a solution, typically but not always aqueous, that contains one or more surfactants, followed by removal of excess water via a drying (e.g., thermal or freeze) or evacuation process. In addition to the surfactant(s), one or more ionic compounds (salts) can be incorporated into the solid material so as to enhance its ability to create localized regions of high tonicity. Regardless of how achieved, the local tonicity around the solid material is at least moderately high, with an osmolarity of at least ˜0.1 Osm/L being preferred for most applications. Solid materials that create local tonicities greater than ˜0.1 Osm/L will have enhanced bactericidal activity with further increases in the osmotic pressure providing further enhanced antimicrobial efficacy. The solid material can take any of a variety of intermediate and final shapes or forms including, but are not limited to, a spongy solid that is permeable to vapor and or liquids; a molded, extruded or deposited sheet; a coating on a surface or layer in a multilayer structure; and an extruded fiber or thread. Once in a particular shape, the material then can be further processed or manipulated so as to provide a desired shape, e.g., a sheet good can be rolled or folded so as to provide a membrane of a particular geometry or a larger solid can be ground into a powder. Both the liquid and solid forms can act at least in part to interrupt or break ionic crosslinks in the macromolecular matrix of a biofilm, facilitating the passage of solutes and surfactant through the matrix to bacteria entrained therein and/or protected thereby. Both forms also typically do not involve C1-C4 alcohols, yet can result, after no more than 10 minutes residence time, in at least 6 log (99.9999%) reductions in the number of bacteria in an entrenched biofilm. Embodiments of the composition which are non-toxic if ingested can result, after no more than 10 minutes residence time, in at least 2 log (99%), 3 log (99.9%) or 4 log (99.99%) reductions in the number of bacteria in an entrenched biofilm. In the discussion of particular applications of the previously described compositions and solid materials, terms such as “low,” “moderate,” and “high” are used in connection with properties such as toxicity and efficacy. Toxicity refers to negative effects on biological tissues or systems, with low toxicity referring to little or no irritation even upon repeated applications, high LD50 values, little or no cytotoxicity, and/or no systemic toxicity, and high toxicity referring to irritation upon repeated exposure, low LD50 values, and/or moderate-to-high cytotoxicity; toxicity generally increases with increasing surfactant concentration, increasing tonicity, and/or departure of pH from neutral. Efficacy refers to lethality against microbes and/or ability to disrupt or even remove the EPS/ECPS in which certain bacterial colonies reside, with low efficacy referring to <2 log, or even <1 log reduction in bacteria (particularly those in an entrenched biofilm) and high efficacy referring to >2 log, >3 log, >4 log, >5 log and even >6 log reductions in bacteria; efficacy generally increases with departures of pH from neutral, surfactant loading increases, tonicity increases, and optimization of surfactant architecture (e.g., higher charge potentials, smaller groups near a charged site, smaller hydrophilic sites, etc.) or type (i.e., cationic>zwitterionic>anionic>non-ionic). Wounds A number of pathogenic bacteria often are present in and around wounds. Gram positive bacteria include Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Gram negative bacteria include Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumanii, Haemophilus influenza, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Various fungi also can be present in burn wounds. Wound colonization often occurs in stages, with bacterial flora in the wound changing over time. Initially, wounds are colonized by aerobic gram positive cocci, such as S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus spp., followed by gram negative rods such as P. aeruginosa, E. coli, K pneumoniae, and A. baumannii. The wound later is colonized by anaerobic species such as Prevotella spp., and Porphorymonas spp. Bacteria can colonize a wound and form a biofilm having mixed species communities of aerobic bacteria near the surface and anaerobic bacteria deeper in the biofilm. Biofilms are a major, perhaps primary, factor in making a wound chronic and preventing healing because neither the body's natural defenses or antibiotics are able to eradicate bacteria in a biofilm. Additional reasons that wound infections can be difficult to treat include the avascular nature of wound eschars and the presence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. Human and animal wounds can classified as (1) acute, which includes skin abrasions, surgical incisions, trauma, and burns, or (2) chronic, which includes diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous arterial ulcers. Acute wounds generally heal through an orderly and timely regenerative process with sequential, yet somewhat overlapping, stages of healing: haemostasis, inflammation, and regeneration and repair. In haemostasis, damaged endothelial lining exposes platelets to sub-endothelial collagen, which then releases von Willebrand factor and tissue thromboplastin. The von Willebrand factor facilitates platelet adhesion to sub-endothelial collagen and the adhered platelets release ADP and thromboxane A2, which leads to further platelet aggregation. Tissue thromboplastin then activates the coagulation pathways, leading to the formation of fibrin, which forms a plug into which platelets and red blood cells are trapped, thereby leading to clot formation. In inflammation, platelets release platelet-derived growth factor and transformation growth factor β, which are chemotactic to neutrophils and monocytes. Neutrophils and macro-phages phagocytose foreign material and bacteria. Platelet-derived growth factor and transformation growth factors are mitogenic to epithelium and fibroblasts. In the regeneration and repair phase, this leads to proliferation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which produce collagen. Vascular endothelial growth factor is mitogenic to endothelial cells, and it is released by monocytes in response to hypoxia and promotes angiogenesis. During the first 24 hours of the healing process in acute wounds, neutrophils are the predominant cell type; this is the acute inflammation phase where epithelial cells start proliferating and migrating into the wound cavity. Over the next 24-48 hours, where macro-phage and fibroblasts are the dominant cell types, epithelial cell proliferation and migration continues and angiogenesis begins. Granulation tissue appears and collagen fibers are present but are vertical and do not bridge the wound gap. Granulation tissue includes newly formed capillary loops. By the end of fifth day, the predominant cell type is fibroblasts, which synthesize collagen to bridge the wound edges. Epidermal cells continue to divide, the epidermis becomes multilayered, and abundant granulation tissue is present. During the second week, acute inflammation subsides, and collagen continues to accumulate. The foregoing is inapplicable to burns and chronic wounds. In burn wounds, the lack of a protective barrier due to the injury often results in septic infections. In chronic wounds, the wound fails to proceed through an orderly progression, causing the wound to remain in the inflammation phase of the healing process. The forms that the treatment can take, the stages of a wound that can benefit from a treatment, the types and forms of bacteria present in the wound, and the portions of the wound and surrounding skin that can be treated all are indicative of the breadth of the present invention. Each possible combination of variables cannot be described individually; instead, many of the variables will be discussed separately, and the ordinarily skilled artisan is capable of combining these individual descriptions to provide for a given form that can be used in or near a particular type of wound at a particular stage of the healing process. Wound Types Both chronic and acute wounds can affect only the epidermis and dermis or can affect tissue down to the fascia. Chronic wounds, which primarily affect humans although also occur with horses, most often are caused by poor circulation, neuropathy, and lack of mobility, although other factors such as systemic illness (including infection and diabetes), age, repeated trauma and co-morbid ailments such as vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, neoplasia, metabolic disorders, and diseases that cause ischemia (e.g., chronic fibrosis, atherosclerosis, edema, sickle cell disease, arterial insufficiency-related illnesses, etc.) or that suppress the immune system. All of these can act to overwhelm the body's ability to deal with wound damage via the common healing process be disrupting the precise balance between production and degradation of molecules such as collagen seen in acute wounds, with degradation playing a disproportionately large a role. Many of the aforementioned causes result in inadequate tissue oxygenation, leading to a higher risk for infection. The immune response to the presence of bacteria prolongs inflammation and delays healing, leading to a chronic wound and damaged tissue. Bacterial colonization and infection damage tissue by causing a greater number of neutrophils to enter the wound site. Although neutrophils fight pathogens, they also release inflammatory cytokines and enzymes that damage cells as well as produce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) to kill bacteria; enzymes and ROS produced by neutrophils and other leukocytes damage cells and prevent cell proliferation and wound closure by damaging DNA, lipids, proteins, the extracellular matrix, and cytokines that facilitate healing. Neutrophils remain in chronic wounds longer than in acute wounds and contribute to the fact that chronic wounds have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS, and chronic wound fluid has an excess of proteases and ROS, so the fluid itself interferes with healing by inhibiting cell growth and breaking down growth factors and proteins in the extracellular matrix. Chronic wounds typically are classified as diabetic ulcers, venous ulcers and pressure ulcers, although a small number of wounds not falling into one these categories can be caused by, for example, radiation poisoning or ischemia. Generally accepted wisdom is that disinfectants are contraindicated for the treatment of chronic wounds. This belief is based on a variety of factors, including the potential to damage tissue, potential delay in wound contraction, and general ineffectiveness in the presence of organic matter, e.g., blood and exudates. An acute wound results from a force that exceeds the resistive strength of the skin and/or underlying supporting tissues, resulting in an abrasion, puncture, laceration, or incision. Most acute wounds result from a trauma, with most of the remainder resulting from a medical procedure, e.g., surgery. Surgical wounds commonly are classified on a sliding scale that ranges from clean to contaminated to dirty, with surgical wounds that are contaminated or dirty (or known to be infected) occasionally being left open for treatment prior to being sutured. Surgical wounds almost always are dressed, with dressing selection based on the amount of exudate to be absorbed (leakage of exudate onto surrounding skin can cause blistering, particularly in the area under the dressing), supporting haemostasis and protecting against infection. Wound Treatment Fundamental wound care protocol involves cleansing (i.e., removal of debris and softening of necrotic tissue), possible debridement, absorbing excess exudate, promoting granulation and epithelialization, and treating infection. The cleansing agents used at this stage tend to be based on surfactants targeted at physical removal of dirt and bacteria with very little (if any) killing of bacteria being effected. Common treatments for wounds involve dressing changes, medicated dressings, and cleansing or debridement. These often are combined with systemic and/or topical antibiotics which, unfortunately, are ineffective when treating bacteria in a biofilm due to their sessile state. (Orders of magnitude more antibiotic(s) are needed to kill bacteria in a biofilm, an amount which makes most/all antibiotics toxic to the host.) Changing dressings to dry ones, if performed, can be a means of mechanical debridement which causes injury to new tissue growth, causes pain, predisposes a wound to infection, becomes a foreign body and delays healing time. Debridement is performed for necrotic tissue and infection in the wound. This can be accomplished by multiple methods, including mechanical, autolytic, surgical, enzymatic or biochemical, or biological. Hydrogels are often applied to wounds to keep them hydrated. Negative pressure wound therapy can be used to pull bacteria from a wound. Hyperbaric chambers can also be used to attempt to improve wound healing. Topical application of an antibacterial product such as alcohols, H2O2, povidone-iodine and dilute HClO, sometimes is performed to control bacterial load. A number of gels and dressing are marketed for the treatment of infections in wounds, including antibacterial silver-loaded gels, calcium fiber gels and alginates (which entrap bacteria). None of these are effective against biofilms, however, and therefore are not effective in treating many wounds. As mentioned previously acute wounds generally heal through an orderly, multi-stage regenerative process that includes haemostasis, inflammation, and regeneration/repair. The aforementioned compositions and solid materials can be useful in treatments at each of these stages. Further, the treatments can be targeted at preventing bacterial colonization, including the formation of biofilms, or at treating an infection, including in biofilm form, in or near a wound. Concurrent with or soon after wound formation, the wound and surrounding skin can be treated so as to minimize the risk of infection. This treatment can be effected by cleansing the area with a liquid composition or by contacting the area with a solid form carrier such as, for example, a topical wipe. At this stage, long term exposure to the treating medium is not expected, so increasing efficacy at the cost of reducing biocompatibility is acceptable. Efficacy can be bolstered by increasing osmolarity, pushing the pH farther from neutral and/or using more aggressive surfactants. For example, liquid compositions (which includes semi-solid materials such as gels, salves and balms) intended for immediate removal or topical wipes intended for use in field situations where other treatment will not be immediate can have a relatively extreme pH (e.g., 2 to 4 or 10 to 12), whereas liquid compositions not intended for immediate removal and topical wipes intended for use in situations other than extreme situations can have an intermediate pH (e.g., 4 to 5 or 9 to 10), and liquid compositions not intended to be removed, or compositions/wipes intended for use with children or small animals, can have a gentle pH (e.g., 5 to 6.5 or 7.5 to 9). In addition to or instead of pushing pH farther from neutral, a topical composition also can have a very high osmolarity and/or surfactant loading. Particularly because biofilms are unlikely to have formed at such an early stage, the need for H3O+ or OH− ions to assist in breaking up the EPS/ECPS macromolecular matrix might not be as great and, accordingly, higher loadings of other solutes, buffers and/or surfactants might be sufficient to provide significant lethality against many types of bacteria in planktonic form. For example, at this stage of wound care, a liquid composition with an osmolarity greater than ˜300 mOsm/L and a surfactant loading greater than ˜0.075% (by wt.) often can be adequate for preventing biofilm growth. Adjusting the osmolarity and/or surfactant loading upward (using the amounts provided previously) can provide more effective (i.e., biocidal) compositions, but at the cost of potential for skin irritation. For biocompatibility reasons, non-ionic and cationic surfactants (particularly benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride) are preferred. A variety of grades of liquid antimicrobial compositions for wound care also are envisioned. For example, over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription (Rx) or professional grades can be provided having compositions and properties such as those shown in the following table:

 Liquid antimicrobial compositions can be applied directly or can be delivered and continuously removed, e.g., fed via an instrument like a debrider (e.g., any of the Pulsavac Plus™ family of products, commercially available from Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, Ind.) or even a syringe with a special flow restriction (increased pressure) tip. Also, a liquid composition or one of the foregoing additional (solid or semi-solid, particularly gels including those based on any of a variety of PEGs) forms can be used to provide articles with disinfectant properties such as sponges, topical wipes, bandages, pads, gauze, surgical packing, and the like. In addition to being applied to a wounded area to halt or prevent microbial infection, embodiments of a liquid composition (including gels and foams) or a topical wipe can be used to disinfect the skin of those treating the wound as well as the instruments used in that treatment including, but not limited to, syringes, debriders, tourniquets, and the like. Certain types of wounds, patients and/or treatments argue for the inclusion of other types of materials in or with the disinfecting composition or material. Non-limiting examples of such materials include, but are not limited to, emollients, lotions, humectants, glycosaminogly-cans such as hyaluronic acid, analgesics (e.g., pramoxine, lidocaine, capsaicin, isobutylpropano-icphenolic acid, etc.), colloidal silver (for treatment of burns) and antimicrobials including sporicides, antifungals, antibiotics (e.g., bacitracin, neomycin, polymyxin B, etc.), fragrances, preservatives (e.g., antioxidants), and the like. Adding an antihemorrhagic to the disinfecting (antimicrobial) composition or material, or adding the disinfectant to an antihemorrhagic, is potentially quite useful. Examples of common antihemorrhagic materials used in military and emergency medical settings include fibrin, collagen oxidized starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, thrombin and chitosan. Various embodiments of the disinfecting composition or material can be added to an antihemorrhagic material or article such as a haemostatic bandage (HemCon Medical Technologies, Inc.; Portland, Oreg.), Tisseel™ fibrin sealant (Baxter International Inc.; Deerfield, Ill.), Thrombi-Gel™ gelatin foam hemostat (Pfizer Inc.; New York, N.Y.), GelFoam™ gelatin sponge (Pfizer), GelFoam™ Plus haemostasis kit (Baxter), and the like; alternatively, addition of an antihemorrhagic material to a liquid disinfecting composition or to a solid disinfecting material or article also can be useful. For purpose of exemplification, addition of at least ˜5%, often at least ˜10%, commonly at least ˜20% of disinfecting composition or material in solid or semisolid antihemorrhagic materials (e.g., gel-foam and chitosan bandages). Conversely, from ˜1 to ˜80% (by wt.), commonly from ˜3 to ˜70% (by wt.), and typically from ˜5 to ˜60% antihemorrhagic material (with the amount varying primarily based on the identity and efficacy of the antihemorrhagic, e.g., thrombin, chitosan, oxidized cellulose, or carboxymethyl cellulose) can be added to or incorporated in a disinfecting composition or material. Embodiments of the foregoing are expected to find utility in military battlefield (e.g., pourable powders carried by field medics) and emergency medical applications (e.g., EMT and ambulance kits as well as surgical theater usages), where disinfecting capability (efficacy) preferably is high, e.g., high osmolarity and surfactant levels. Blood and wound fluid can hydrate a solid material or a concentrated liquid composition, so levels of water or other carrier can be kept low. Other embodiments are expected to find utility in connection with less traumatic wounds, such as shaving cuts or improperly trimmed animal nails, where an embodiment of the liquid or solid disinfecting material might be added to a styptic such as alum or TiO2. From the foregoing, the ordinarily skilled artisan can envision numerous articles, techniques and ways in which wounds can be cleansed. Embodiments of the previously described liquid compositions and solid materials also can be used at during various stages of the wound healing process. As described in more detail above, wounds are believed to heal via a process that involves haemostasis, inflammation, and repair and/or regeneration. During these phases, a variety of topical medicaments and articles are applied to wounds and surrounding areas, some for brief periods of time and others for an extended duration. For example, many wounds are bandaged soon after occurrence and, in certain circumstances, re-bandaged over time. A bandage that includes an embodiment of the liquid composition can help to prevent infection, treat infection, prevent biofilms, or break up a biofilm and kill the bacteria entrained therein. In this particular form, a strong disinfecting composition (high osmolarity and relatively extreme pH, e.g., ˜3.5 to 5 or ˜9 to 10.5) can be preferable because high efficacy and microbial toxicity are desired and because the bandage typically only overlays the wound. Methods of making such a bandage include soaking bandage material in a liquid composition or by coating or entraining in the bandage material a gel, optionally one that undergoes a temperature-based phase change, i.e., becomes less viscous between ˜25° to ˜40° C. (Alternatively, some PEG-based gels themselves can act as bandages.) Tailoring the elution rate of the disinfecting composition over the expected use period of the bandage can be desirable. Alternatively, an embodiment of a solid form disinfectant can be used to provide a bandage. The solid article can be in as-made form (e.g., spongy solid) or in further processed form (e.g., a fiber made from a solid). Here, the bandage material itself is antimicrobial, although such a material certainly can be further loaded with additional composition or with other antimicrobials. A variation on the foregoing theme involves surgical packing, which is structurally similar to a bandage although typically is intended for insertion into the body for a limited time or to be bioresorbed within a predetermined amount of time. The method of making a surgical packing is essentially the same as those set out above with respect to bandages, although the efficacy and toxicity levels and/or the elution rate can be downwardly adjusted. Ongoing wound treatment sometimes involve repeated applications of a gel, paste or salve directly to the wound. Because of the amount of time that such materials are allowed to reside on or in the wound, these materials typically involve gentle or only moderately strong disinfecting composition embodiments. In other words, efficacy and toxicity can be reduced to avoid pain or tissue damage, a sacrifice that is offset by the proximity of the treatment to the wound and its length of contact. Both bandages and topical treatments can be used in connection with burn wounds. In such circumstances, addition of a variety of adjuvants and additional treatments can be preferable. Potentially useful adjuvants include colloidal silver, analgesics, antifungals, emollients, hyaluronic acid, and the like. Because wound edema is common, a somewhat concentrated, even solid, form of topically applied disinfectant can be used. Similarly, both bandages and topical treatments can be used in connection with diabetic and pressure ulcers, i.e., chronic wounds. Similar adjuvants, particularly analgesics, hyaluronic acid, and emollients, can be included in embodiments intended for this use. Embodiments of the liquid composition also can find utility in connection with debridement techniques and equipment. Specifically, such liquid compositions can be used to irrigate or flush an area prior to, simultaneously with, or immediately after debridement. While most of the foregoing embodiments have been described as single use, articles intended for multiple applications are envisioned. These are expected to have high loading levels that are intended to elute over time. Oral Care The oral environment initially changes due to an increased concentration of carbohydrates in the diet of the host. The anaerobic bacteria in the plaque biofilm produce acid by fermenting these carbohydrates, thus reducing the pH of the biofilm; some of the more common bacteria responsible for this shift in composition include S. mutans, S. sorbrinus, and Lactobacillus casei, all of which can survive at a pH level as low as 3.0. As the pH drops, the microflora shift towards acid-tolerant bacteria, as intolerant bacteria cannot survive in the acidic conditions formed. At highly acidic pH, the acid-tolerant bacterial biofilm can de-mineralize the tooth enamel, with greater degrees of acidity causing faster rates of demineralization. (Demineralization of tooth enamel can also occur solely from the presence of highly acidic substances in the oral cavity.) Caries result if demineralization persists at a rate greater than re-mineralization occurs. S. mutans, Lactobacilli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscosus, Nocardia spp., and Streptococcus sanguis are most closely associated with oral caries but, because most plaque-induced oral diseases occur with a diverse microflora present, the specific causal species is not known. Plaque and tartar (hardened plaque) become more harmful the longer that they remain on the teeth. The bacteria within the biofilm cause inflammation of the gums, commonly known as gingivitis, a mild form of gum disease that does not include any loss of bone and tissue holding the teeth in place. Spirochetes, Actinomyces naeslundii, and P. gingivalis are often associated with the gingivitis. Untreated gingivitis progresses to inflammation around the tooth, commonly known as periodontitis, a condition where the gums retract from the teeth and form gaps or pockets that can become infected because they are easily colonized by microbes due to dentinal tubules and enamel fissures that lead directly into the gums; the biofilm plaque spreads and grows below the gum line. The majority of the bacteria within the microflora in these gum pockets are gram-negative anaerobes, although the identity of the microbes in the biofilm change as the biofilm itself changes. At a certain point, the organisms must disperse to other locations in the oral cavity to ensure survival. Periodontitis involves progressive loss of the alveolar bone around the teeth and the connective tissue that holds the teeth in place due to the bacterial toxins in the biofilm and the body's immune response to the biofilm. If left untreated, this can lead to loosening and subsequent loss of teeth. The areas around and under the gums are difficult to reach via typical oral health care mechanisms that are mechanical in nature and, as such, the diseased states of gingi-vitis or periodontitis occur. The same bacterial listed above in connection with gingivitis can be involved in periodontitis, but an enormous variety of other bacteria can be found in these biofilms. Peri-implantitis, which is similar to periodontitis but occurs on the surface of dental implants, refers to the destruction of the supporting peri-implant tissue due to a microbial infection. These infections tend to occur around residual teeth or failing implants, which can act as reservoirs for bacteria and form biofilm colonies, as they have no inherent host response to fight the infecting organisms. The bacterial species involved in peri-implantitis are similar to those involved in periodontitis. The primary treatment for dental diseases is prevention. For the consumer, this involves tasks such as tooth brushing (mechanical debridement), usually with a fluoride-containing toothpaste; oral rinsing with a mouthwash containing cetylpyridinium chloride, stannous fluoride, or a combination of eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate and thymol in an alcohol vehicle; and flossing. (Mouthwashes and rinses are not particularly effective at removing plaque, which necessitates continued use of floss in the inter-dental regions, as plaque tends to accumulate in these areas which brushing does not clean.) Regardless, because these preventive treatments are not effective at removing and disinfecting a biofilm, regular prophy-lactic treatment (removal of biofilm from the teeth, typically by mechanical scraping, although lasers have been used additionally or alternatively) by a dental professional usually is necessary. When dental disease has progressed to periodontitis, mechanical scraping (debridement) has been the only way to remove a biofilm. Professional treatment by a dental professional is performed by scaling (scraping of tartar from above and below the gum line) and root planning (removal of rough spots on the tooth root where the biofilm gathers), sometimes in combination with a laser. In more serious cases, to remove more tartar, flap surgery may be performed, where the gums are lifted so that tartar can be removed, followed by suturing. Bone and tissue grafts may also be performed in the area of bone loss. Medications are sometimes used in conjunction with mechanical treatments. These include prescription antimicrobial mouth rinses containing chlorhexidine; gum pocket inserts such as an antiseptic chip containing chlorhexidine, an antibiotic gel containing doxycycline, antibiotic microspheres containing minocycline, etc.; tablets containing doxycycline; or even systemic antibiotics. The aforedescribed antimicrobial compositions, both acidic and caustic, can be incorporated into any of a variety of oral care vehicles such as, but not limited to oral rinses and washes intended for preventive use, oral rinses intended to treat existing dental and gum disease, oral rinse treatment after dental implants, dental implant sterilization solutions (pre-surgical), disinfecting solutions for orthodontic devices (e.g., braces, retainers, etc.), irrigation solutions (both for use in surgical procedures, such as root canals and impacted teeth prior to closure, as well as in general and localized dental procedures), and the like. The vehicle can be a liquid, gel (e.g., a sealing or packing gel used during and/or after oral surgery), paste (e.g., toothpaste), or salve (e.g., topical treatment for mouth and lip conditions such as canker sores) and can be used with components such as fluoride ions and antibiotics, if desired. Where a liquid antimicrobial composition is to be introduced directly into an oral cavity (e.g., a mouthwash or rinse), some preference can be given to caustic compositions. Because most mouths naturally are a somewhat acidic environment, dental plaque, tartar and other forms of EPS/ECPS seem to be more impervious or resistant to chelation by acids than many other types of biofilm EPS/ECPS. Exemplary pH ranges for caustic compositions used here range from ˜7.5 to ˜10, commonly from ˜7.7 to ˜9.8, more commonly from ˜7.8 to ˜9.7, and typically ˜9±0.5 pH units. This basicity preferably is achieved with a strong inorganic base such as KOH or NaOH. With respect to tonicity, preferred ranges center around ˜1.75 Osm/L, commonly from ˜1.25 to ˜2.5 Osm/L, more commonly from ˜1.33 to ˜2.25 Osm/L, and typically from ˜1.5 to ˜2 Osm/L. To reach this type of tonicity without the pH going outside the previously noted ranges, one or more ionic compounds can be included in the composition. Exemplary materials include, but are not limited to, NaHSO4, NaH2PO4, NaCl, KCl, KI and the like. Non-ionic and cationic surfactants are preferred for the same reasons set forth above in connection with wound care. Both benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride are known to be safe for oral applications. Exemplary surfactant loading levels range from ˜0.5 to ˜1.8 g/L, commonly from ˜0.6 to ˜1.7 g/L, and typically from ˜0.75 to ˜1.5 g/L. The following table provides the composition and properties of a non-limiting example of a liquid antimicrobial composition intended for oral care applications.

 The antimicrobial compositions also can be incorporated into solid forms, such as chewing gums, lozenges, denture cleaning tablets, breath mints, removable or dissolving strips, powders and the like. They also can be used as, or incorporated in, liquids intended for aerosolizing or other spray techniques, such as breath sprays and dog teeth cleaning solutions. For additional information on the type and amounts that can be employed exemplary liquid and solid formulations, as well as methods of making, the interested reader is directed to any of a variety of references including, for example, U.S. Pat. Publ. Nos. 2005/0169852, 2006/0210491, 2007/0166242, 2008/0286213, 2009/0252690, and 2010/0330000. Those treatments intended for preventive applications typically will be form-ulated around lower toxicity thresholds than those intended for use by dental professionals. Adjuvants that can be included in such treating compositions include, but are not limited to, bleaching agents, binders, flavorings (e.g., essential oils and artificial sweeteners), humectants, foaming agents, abrasives, desensitizers, tooth whiteners, and analgesics. Treatment of adenoids and tonsils, although not strictly oral care, also is possible. Acute infections of the tonsils and adenoids generally are treated with systemic antibiotics. If tonsillitis is caused by group A streptococcus, penicillin or amoxicillin are commonly used with some success, while cephalosporins and macrolides being used less fre-quently. If these fail against β lactamase-producing bacteria (which reside in tonsil tissues and can shield group A streptococcus from penicillin-type antibiotics), clindamycin or amoxicillin-clavulanate may be used. Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the most common reason for chronic tonsil infections. Systemic antibiotics fail to treat GABHS due to a number of factors, including the presence of β lactamase-producing organisms that protect GABHS from peni-cillins, coaggregation with M. catarrhalis, absence of competing bacterial flora, poor penetration of antibiotics into tonsil cells, etc. Additionally, GABHS is known to form biofilms. This bacteria, as well as other pathogenic strains, can form biofilms on and within the tonsils and/or adenoids. Infectious bacteria in biofilm form are relatively impervious to systemic antibiotics, meaning that such high levels of antibiotics are necessary to treat them (i.e., orders of magnitude more than is necessary to kill planktonic bacteria) that the patient is unlikely to survive. Biofilm infections often become chronic. When the condition becomes chronic, surgical methods are employed to remove the tonsils and adenoids. The current treatment for chronic infections of the tonsils and adenoids is surgical removal through a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. This can be done by powered ablation which essentially burns away the tonsils and/or adenoids, a technique that minimizes or prevents bleeding of the tonsil bed post-surgery, or by cold steel instruments or mechanical debridement, in which case localized cauterization is performed on bleeding vessels to prevent re-bleeding after surgery. Tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, is one of the most common surgical procedures in the developed world. These surgical interventions are not without risk, however, with post-operative bleeding, airway obstruction, and adverse reaction to anesthesia being three of the most common problems. A substantial amount of pain and hospital recovery times also can be associated with these procedures. Bleeding can occur when scabs begin sloughing off from the surgical sites, generally 7 to 11 days after surgery. This occurs at a rate of about 1% to 2%, with both risk and severity being higher in adults than in children. A topical treatment for these infections is not available, as no commercially available product can disinfect and remove the biofilm and EPS from the tonsil/adenoid surface, nor can these products penetrate into the tonsil and adenoid surface to treat bacteria within the tissue. Of the oral mouth rinses on the market, which have active ingredients that include chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, SnF2 and mixtures of therapeutic oils, none can disinfect a biofilm in the short treatment times available in the oral cavity. Antimicrobial compositions of the type described above, however, can be effective in treating infected adenoids and tonsils. A treatment regimen might be to gargle or rinse with up to 100 mL from 1 to 4 times each day, with the treatment running for as long as necessary, generally from 5-70 days, commonly from 7-65 days, more commonly from 8-60 days, and typically from 10-50 days, with 30±10 days being envisioned as most typical. In addition, direct application of an antimicrobial solid material directly to the affected area(s) also is envisioned. Advantages of this type of treatment include, but are not limited to, elimination of post-operative bleeding, avoidance of anesthesia, elimination of post-operative pain, preservation of anatomy, elimination of the risks of morbidity/mortality due to surgery and post-surgical complications, and overall lower healthcare costs. Medical Equipment Prior to disinfection or sterilization, all reusable medical devices must be cleaned thoroughly, a step that requires that all surfaces, internal and external, be made completely free of so-called bioburden, i.e., residual body tissue and fluids, bacteria, fungi, viruses, proteins, and carbohydrates. After the manual and/or mechanical cleaning, the devices must be thoroughly rinsed to remove all residual bioburden and detergent. With current technology, if the device is not clean, sterilization cannot be achieved. Current chemical treatments are ineffective at treating biofilms because of their inherent resistance to biocides. Biofilms can be removed by physical methods such as ultra-sound and mechanical cleaning reasonably effectively, but ensuring that it occurs correctly and completely each time is very difficult. Endoscopes are particularly susceptible to biofilm formation due to their use within the body. Removal of biofilm from the internal surfaces of small diameter tubing within endoscopes is difficult due to limited access and the degradation of these surfaces. Biofilm formation within endoscope channels can result in failure of disinfection procedures and can create a vicious cycle of growth, disinfection, partial killing or inhibition and regrowth, and patients who undergo endoscopy with a biofilm-containing endoscope are at risk for an endoscopy related infection. Bacteria in a biofilm have been shown to be capable of surviving in a down-regulated state after being cleaned and disinfected by present methods. The cleaning and disinfecting processes used are dependent upon the training and diligence of the operator and, while guidelines for endoscope disinfection have been developed by many organizations, no method to determine the efficacy of these regimes on a routine basis is currently available. Failure to completely clean and dry an endoscope using the current guidelines can lead to biofilm formation, with studies suggesting that human error is a major contributing factor, along with the need for rapid turnover of equipment and inadequate training. Similar problems are inherent in the cleaning and disinfection processes used with other medical devices and equipment, although endoscopes seem to be linked to more outbreaks of HAIs, a problem discussed in more detail below. Also problematic are devices and equipment that are not necessarily designed for invasive insertion. This includes manual instruments, powered surgical instruments, and even devices cages and guides for performing spinal surgery. These too are cleaned and disinfected post-usage, with the procedure generally involving wiping followed by sterilization (normally by steam, but occasionally by peroxide or other high performance procedures). Some devices are returned to their manufacturer for reprocessing, often with steam sterilization both before and after reprocessing. The formulation of reprocessing cleaning solutions are unique; however, most contain some combination of at least six components: water, detergent, surfactant, buffer, and chelating agents. Enzymes are also used to increase cleaning efficacy, speed the cleaning process and help to minimize the need for manual brushing and scrubbing. A variety of enzymes, each targeting a particular type of soil, are employed, with the most common being protease (which helps to break down protein-based soils such as blood and feces), amylase (which breaks down starches like those found in muscle tissue), cellulase (which breaks down carbohydrates like those found in connective fluid and joint tissue), and lipase (which breaks down fats like those found in adipose tissue). Any combination of these enzymes may be present in a solution. Solutions containing enzymes can often be used at a more neutral pH and at lower temperatures than those without enzymes. Enzymatic cleaning agents are used as the first step in medical device disinfection to remove biofilms. However, physical cleaning with an enzymatic cleaning agent does not disinfect the device. Even a few viable organisms that might remain after cleaning can accumulate into a biofilm over time. It has been found that commonly used enzymatic cleaners fail to reduce the viable bacterial load or remove the bacterial EPS. Cleaners with high enzyme activity remove some biofilm but fail to reduce bacterial numbers more than 2 logs (i.e., 99%), and some enzymatic solutions actually can contribute to the formation of biofilms. Accordingly, proper disinfection is required to kill down-regulated microbes and prevents the formation of biofilm. All devices undergo a disinfection process and users perform a chemical disinfection process following cleaning. Either an oxidative or aldehyde-based chemistry is used. However, some disinfection chemistries have demonstrated a tendency to promote the formation of biofilms and none completely remove a biofilm that has already formed. Gluteraldehyde solution buildup over several uses actually has been found to promote formation of biofilms within the lumens of endoscopes. Disinfectants employing oxidative chemistries are more effective at controlling the formation of biofilms. However, it has been found that even the harsh environment created by some disinfectants can be survived by these well-protected microbes, which can survive by using several food sources not typically thought to be possible. These disinfectants are also susceptible to deactivation by proteins that may be present on the endoscopes and medical devices, especially if the cleaning step is not adequately performed. Cleaning chemicals require unimpeded contact with all surfaces of the device, internal and external, to assure microbial inactivation; any residuals left on the device, including medical soil, contaminants and detergent residue can interfere with that direct contact. Further, even if they have access to a biofilm, they cannot kill bacteria entrained therein. The shape and design of some devices and instruments make it impossible to remove all of the proteins and EPS/ECPS which may be on them. Presently available cleaners or disinfection techniques are unable to completely remove EPS/ECPS, especially if there is protein which can prevent cleaning chemicals from reaching these areas. Remaining EPS/ECPS can allow for rapid biofilm reformation on the device, and the EPS/ECPS can be dislodged into the surgical field, including into the patient, allowing for a nidus of infection. Advantageously, antimicrobial compositions of the type described above can be effective in cleaning, disinfecting and sterilizing reusable medical equipment. In these techniques, both toxicity and efficacy can be pushed to extremely high levels. Depending on the nature of the materials from which the equipment is made, either acidic or basic compositions can be preferred. For example, a caustic composition might be preferred for a metallic piece of equipment, while an acidic composition might be preferred for a plastic piece. Extremely acidic or caustic compositions preferably are avoided, i.e., the composition employed commonly has a pH within 4 units, preferably within 3 units, and more preferably within 2 units of neutral. Where an acidic composition is employed, a conjugate base of the acid preferably also is present. Tonicities of solutions employed here generally are at least ˜2.0 Osm/L, commonly at least ˜2.5 Osm/L, more commonly at least ˜3.0 Osm/L, and typically at least ˜3.5 Osm/L. In both acidic and caustic compositions, additional solute(s) can be present. In compositions with moderate pH (i.e., 5≤pH≤9, particularly 6≤pH≤8), large amounts of such solutes can be used; for example, for a composition of 6.5≤pH≤7.5, the amount of accompanying salt or solute can be as high as 200 g/L, 250 g/L, 300 g/L, 350 g/L, 400 g/L, 450 g/L or even 500 g/L. Regardless of the nature of the material, cationic surfactants are strongly preferred, with particular preference being given to tetradecyltrimethylammonium halides. Surfactant loading can be pushed to very high levels, e.g., 10 g/L, 15 g/L, 20 g/L, or even 30 g/L or more can be used. Advantageously, the equipment need stay in the composition for no more than a few hours. For example, in no case should static dwell time be required to exceed 250 minutes, with less than 200 minutes being common, less than 150 minutes being more common, less than 100 minutes being even more common, and less than 50 minutes being typical. Depending on the particular antimicrobial composition employed, the dwell time can range from 1 to ˜30 minutes, from ˜2 to ˜25 minutes, from ˜3 to ˜20 minutes, or from ˜5 to ˜15 minutes. The amount of dwell time can be decreased even more with flow for treatment and/or mechanical scrubbing to remove the EPS. Higher-than-ambient temperatures and pressures also can increase efficacy, which can be particularly useful equipment having high loadings of bioburden and/or difficult geometry (e.g., scopes). As an example of the extreme efficacy of the liquid antimicrobial compositions described herein in this application, a citric acid/sodium citrate dihydrate composition having a pH of ˜6.5 and a tonicity of ˜3.5 Osm/L and including ˜15 g/L tetradecyltrimethylammonium chloride surfactant was able to achieve a 9 log reduction (i.e., 99.9999999%) in Pseudomonas in small diameter silicone and polyethylene tubing as well as on metal and plastic coupons. HAI Basic routes of infection involve transmission via contact (direct and indirect), droplets, airborne, common vehicle (contaminated items such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment), and vector (from mosquitoes, flies, rodents, etc.), with direct contact being the most frequent mode. In direct contact, a colonized person (e.g., a caregiver or another patient) transfers the microorganism from his body to that of a susceptible patient. Indirect transmission involves contact between the host, usually a caregiver, and a contaminated object which then becomes the vector for infecting the susceptible patient; examples of objects that can become contaminated include instruments and equipment such as needles, dressings, disposable gloves, saline flush syringes, vials, bags, blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, and the like, as well as non-medical surfaces such as door handles, packaging, mops, linens, pens, keyboards, telephones, bed rails, call buttons, touch plates, seating surfaces, light switches, grab rails, intravenous poles, dispensers, dressing trolleys, countertops, tabletops, and the like. Droplet transmission occurs when droplets containing microbes from an infected person are propelled a short distance through the air and deposited on the patient's body. Droplets may be produced from the source person by coughing, sneezing, talking, and during the performance of certain procedures such as bronchoscopy. Airborne transmission can be by either airborne droplet nuclei of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host in the same room as or quite remote from the original source. Microorganisms commonly transmitted in this manner include Legionella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the rubeola and varicella viruses. Of particular and growing interest and concern are MRSA and VRE. Contamination of the environment with MRSA or VRE occurs when infected or colonized individuals are present in hospital rooms, often medical personnel carrying the organism in or on their clothing. MRSA contamination of gloves also has been observed in many personnel who had no direct contact with the patient but who had touched surfaces in infected patient's rooms. The hands, gloved or otherwise, of healthcare workers can become contaminated by touching surfaces in the vicinity of an infected patient. In undried form, MRSA can survive for up to 48 hours on a plastic surface; in dried form, it can survive for several weeks. It is stable at a wide range of temperatures and humidities, and can survive exposure to sunlight and desiccation. Once a surface becomes contaminated, pathogens can be transferred to other surfaces and patients in the vicinity. Hand washing and gloves can help prevent the spread of HAIs via hand-surface transmission but cannot eradicate surface or indwelling contamination, nor do they eliminate the potential for direct transfer by the patient. However, these methods do nothing to treat the presence of these pathogenic bacteria on surfaces and indwelling devices. Touch surfaces commonly found in hospital rooms often are contaminated with MRSA and VRE, with objects in closest proximity to patients having the highest levels of contamination. The efficacy of traditional cleaning products (e.g., alcohols, quaternary ammonia compounds, and bleach) to remove surface contamination is limited. One recent study of contamination in the hospital environment detected MRSA on 74% of swab samples prior to cleaning and on 66% of swab samples after cleaning, indicating that current methods for disinfecting hospital surfaces are ineffective. Some modern sanitizing methods are more effective against select pathogens; for example, non-flammable alcohol vapor in CO2 has been demonstrated to be effective against gastroenteritis, MRSA, and influenza, while H2O2, as a liquid or vapor, has been shown to reduce infection rates and risk of acquisition, particularly in connection with endospore-forming bacteria such as Clostridium difficile. However, these are so-called “contained” methods (i.e., done in a closed, controlled environment) and cannot be performed unless the object can be removed and taken to a separate treatment facility, and, even then, none have proven to be effective against biofilms and, even in those instances when sanitization is achieved, the biofilm EPS is not removed by any of these treatments (thereby permitting much more rapid re-growth of the bacterial biofilm as compared to an EPS-free surface when a pathogen is re-introduced). From the foregoing, the ordinarily skilled artisan can envision many potential applications for the antimicrobial compositions described previously in the battle against HAIs, as well as biofilms containing or capable of entraining HAI-causing microorganisms. Common examples include cleaning and/or disinfection of any of the types of hard surfaces mentioned above, as well as floors and walls; water transport articles including sinks, therapeutic tubs, showers and drains; beds; transport devices such as gurneys and wheelchairs; surgical suites; and the like. In these instances, high efficacy and low toxicity generally are preferred. Particularly preferred are those compositions which will not harm (e.g., warp or discolor) the surface being treated. Other common examples include cleaning and/or disinfection of any of the types of medical equipment mentioned above, particularly those which are intended for insertion into a patient (e.g., respiratory tubes, IV lines, and catheters) or application to the skin (e.g., stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, and the like). Again, high efficacy and low toxicity generally are preferred for this type of application. Other examples include laundering compositions for linens and clothing, hand disinfectants and washes, surgical site preparation solutions, and the like. Laundering compositions are envisioned as typically being caustic and including high loading levels of surfactant, as well as being capable of being provided in either liquid or solid form for addition to wash water. Hand washes and surgical preparation compositions would be very similar to the OTC and Rx wound washes described previously. No particular limitation on the types of microbes that can be treated are envisioned, with particularly problematic pathogenic organisms like Clostridium difficile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, MRSA, and VRE being specifically envisioned. Also envisioned is any microbe that forms or can reside in a biofilm, with treatment involving both destruction/removal of the biofilm as well as killing of the microbes entrained therein. Implants Although terminally sterilized, medical device implants can become colonized, prior to and during implantation, with bacteria from the environment, from a healthcare worker, or more commonly from bacteria present on the patient's own skin. After insertion, implants can become colonized from systemic bacteria which make their way to the implant which provides a surface for biofilm growth because the implant surface is not protected by the host immune defenses. In addition, currently employed sterilization techniques are not designed to remove EPS/ECPS. Therefore, even a sterilized device/article that is properly implanted can have EPS/ECPS on its surface from previous exposure. The presence of EPS/ECPS greatly facilitates formation of a biofilm. Soon after a device or article is implanted, a conditioning layer composed of host-derived adhesins (including fibrinogen, fibronectin, and collagen) forms on the surface of the implant and invites adherence of free-floating (planktonic) organisms. Bacterial cell division, recruitment of additional planktonic organisms, and secretion of bacterial products (such as the glycocalyx) follow, resulting in a three-dimensional structure of biofilm that contains complex communities of tightly attached (sessile) bacteria. These bacteria display cell-to-cell signaling and exist within a polymer matrix containing fluid channels that allow for the flow of nutrients and waste. Once a biofilm forms on an implant, no currently available treatment can eradicate it. Systemic antibiotics are ineffective against such infections, certainly due to the inherent protection by the EPS/ECPS but also perhaps due to limited blood supply at the surface of the implanted article. Most implants infected by S. aureus or candida require surgical removal. Infections with less virulent coagulase-negative staphylococci may not require surgery to remove the implant. If a decision is made to remove the infected implant, complete extraction of all components is performed, regardless of the type of infecting organism. An infected joint prosthesis can be retained after debridement or, more commonly, removed. In removal situations, the affected area is treated with large doses of antibiotics, optionally followed by insertion of a new device either immediately or, more commonly, after a 35-45 day course of a systemic antibiotic. Infections (and treatments) associated with orthopedic devices often result in serious disabilities. Infections associated with surgical implants are particularly difficult to manage because they require longer periods of antibiotic therapy and repeated surgical procedures. Mortality attributable to such infections is highest among patients with cardiovascular implants, particularly prosthetic heart valves and aortic grafts. A biofilm-fouled pacemaker-defibrillator implant often is treated by a combined medical and surgical treatment. Surgical treatment is done in two-stages: the entire implanted system, including the cardiac leads, is completely removed, even in patients with clinical infection of only the pocket, because their cardiac leads may already be colonized (with cardiac rhythm being controlled by a temporary mechanism), a lengthy course of systemic antibiotics is administered (up to two weeks for infections of the pulse-generator pocket or 35-45 days for lead-associated endocarditis), and a replacement device/article is implanted on the contralateral side of the patient. Infections of fracture-fixation devices that involve bone are treated with a 6-week course of systemic antibiotics, whereas 10 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy are sufficient for superficial infections. Infection of intramedullary nails is often associated with nonunion of bone and requires removal of the infected nail, insertion of external-fixation pins, and if necessary, subsequent insertion of a replacement nail. Surgical treatment of infection of external-fixation pins usually consists of a single procedure to remove the infected pins and, if bone union has not occurred, either insert new pins at a distant site or fuse the bones. Treatment of infected mammary implants usually entails a two-stage replacement procedure: removal of the infected implant and debridement of the capsule surrounding it. After administration of a course of systemic antibiotics and time for the area to heal somewhat, the contralateral implant is removed, and a replacement pair of mammary implants is inserted. An infected penile implant typically is removed, and a malleable penile prosthesis is inserted to preserve space. After the necessary systemic antibiotic treatment, a new inflatable implant is inserted in place of the malleable prosthesis. Even cutaneous implants such as tracheotomy tubes, ostomy bags, catheters, and piercings can become fouled with biofilms that are difficult to remove, a problem exacerbated by the non-removal nature of certain types of these articles. The aforedescribed antimicrobial compositions can be effective topical treatments, applied to a to-be-implanted device or article or can be used to wash the infected implant and surrounding tissue to rid the body of a biofilm and/or biofilm-forming materials such as EPS/ECPS. The types of surfaces involved can be or include PTFE, PVC, silicone gels and rubbers, polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(meth)acrylates, stainless steel, precious metals (e.g., gold, silver, and platinum), ceramics, and titanium. The pocket where the implant is or was located likewise can be treated with a liquid composition of the types mentioned above in connection with wound care. This can be done at the time of the original implantation (i.e., immediately following insertion of the article and prior to suturing), and can be followed with rinsing/irrigation, suctioning or both. For implants in contact with body tissue, low toxicity but moderate-to-high efficacy is desired; this might be achievable with a composition having a fairly neutral pH (e.g., 5≤pH≤9) but moderate-to-high osmolarity, e.g., at least ˜1.5 Osm/L, commonly at least ˜1.75 Osm/L, more commonly at least ˜2.0 Osm/L, and typically at least ˜2.25 Osm/L. Compositions with tonicities of ˜2.5, ˜2.75, ˜3.0, ˜3.25, ˜3.5, ˜3.75 or even ˜4 Osm/L can be used. Cationic surfactants again are preferred, preferably at levels of ˜0.5 to ˜2 g/L, more preferably of ˜0.7 to ˜1.8 g/L, and most preferably of ˜0.8 to ˜1.5 g/L. For devices not yet in contact with body tissue, the conditions can be more extreme, i.e., higher toxicity and very high osmolarity. In either case, the application of the antimicrobial composition can be by rinsing, wiping, flushing, etc., optionally in conjunction with scraping/debridement and optionally followed by a rinsing step. In extreme cases, the implanted article can be removed and treated ex vivo with the composition prior to reimplantation. Alternative or additional techniques involve preparing a body area in which an implant is to be inserted by washing, wiping and/or irrigating that area with an antimicrobial composition. This can be done in conjunction with surgical preparation sterilization with the same or similar composition. While various embodiments of the present invention have been provided, they are presented by way of example and not limitation. To the extent feasible, as long as they are not interfering or incompatible, features and embodiments described above in isolation can be combined with other features and embodiments.

Killing and/or eliminating these microorganisms is desirable for a variety of reasons. Bacteria present special challenges because they can exist in a number of forms (e.g., planktonic, spore and biofilm) and their self preservation mechanisms make them extremely difficult to treat and/or eradicate. For example, the bacteria in biofilms or spores are down-regulated (sessile) and not actively dividing, which makes them resistant to attack by a large group of antibiotics and antimicrobials that attack the bacteria during the active parts of their lifecycle, e.g., cell division. In a biofilm, bacteria interact with and adhere to surfaces and form colonies which facilitate continued growth. The bacteria produce exopolysaccharide (EPS) and/or extracellularpolysaccharide (ECPS) macromolecules that keep them attached to the surface and form a protective barrier effective against many forms of attack. Protection most likely can be attributed to the small diameter of the flow channels in the matrix, which restricts the size of molecules that can reach the underlying bacteria, and consumption of biocides through interactions with portions of the EPS/ECPS macromolecular matrix and bacterial secretions and waste products contained therein. (Certain fungi also can form biofilms, many of which present the same types of challenges presented here.) Bacteria also can form spores, which are hard, non-permeable protein/poly-saccharide shells or coatings. Spores provide additional resistance to eradication efforts by preventing attack from materials that are harmful to the bacteria. Due to the protection afforded by a macromolecular matrix (biofilm) or shell (spore) and their down-regulated state, bacteria in these states are very difficult to treat. The types of biocides and antimicrobials effective in treating bacteria in this form are strongly acidic and/or oxidizing, often involving halogen atoms, oxygen atoms, or both. Common examples include hypochlorite solutions (e.g., bleach), phenolics, mineral acids (e.g., HCl), H2O2, and the like. Large dosages of such chemicals must be allowed to contact the biofilm or spore for extended amounts of time to be effective, which makes them impractical for many applications. Recently developed formulations intended for use in connection with compromised animal/human tissue solvate a biofilm matrix so that still-living bacteria can be rinsed or otherwise removed from infected tissue; see, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,976,873, 7,976,875, 7,993,675, etc. The concentrations of active ingredients in these formulations are too low to effectively kill the bacteria, however, thus making such formulations ill suited for use as surface disinfectants. Neutral-to-very acidic disinfecting solutions that can disrupt macromolecular matrices, or bypass and/or disable their inherent defenses, allowing ingredients in the solutions to access the bacteria, attack cell membranes, and kill them have been described in U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2010/0086576 A1. Animal tissue wounds present both a good environment for bacterial, and even biofilm, growth and a surface or substrate requiring gentle treatment, thus making a difficult problem even worse. Dental plaque, a biofilm that adheres to a tooth surface, consists of bacterial cells (mainly Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sanguis), salivary polymers and bacterial extracellular products. The accumulation of microorganisms subject the teeth and gingival tissues to high concentrations of bacterial metabolites, which results in widespread problems such as gingivitis and periodontal disease, including oral caries. Nosocomial or hospital acquired infections (HAIs) can be caused by viral, bacterial, and/or fungal pathogens and can involve any system of the body. HAIs are a leading cause of patient deaths, and they increase the length of hospitalizations for patients, mortality and healthcare costs; in the developed world, they are estimated to occur in 5-10% of all hospitalizations, even higher for pediatric and neonatal patients. They often are associated with medical devices or blood product transfusions. Three major sites of HAIs are bloodstream, respiratory tract, and urinary tract. Most patients who have HAIs have invasive supportive measures such as central intravenous lines, mechanical ventilation, and catheters, which provide an ingress point for pathogenic organisms. Ventilator-associated pneumonia can be caused by Staphylococcus aureus, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Candida albicans, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Clostridium difficile, and Tuberculosis, while other HAIs include urinary tract infections, pneumonia, gastroenteritis, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Legionellosis. Medical equipment such as endoscopes, gastroscopes, the flow-channels of hematology and dialyzer equipment, the airflow path of respiratory equipment, ISE, HPLC, and certain catheters are designed to be used multiple times. Significant risks have been associated with inadequate or improper cleaning due to the presence of residual soil and/or improper disinfection or sterilization, up to and including HAIs from contaminated devices such as bronchoscopes contaminated with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the transmission of Hepatitis C virus to patients during colonoscopy procedures. Any surface that is or becomes moist is subject to biofilm formation. Thus, articles intended for permanent or temporary implantation—such as artificial hearts, stents, contact lenses, intrauterine devices, artificial joints, dental implants—are particularly susceptible. Extreme measures are taken to prevent biofilm formation because, once established, they are essentially impossible to eradicate in vivo and can cause life-altering, even lethal, infections. Compositions and articles that can be used in the treatment of microbes such as bacteria remain desirable. Liquids that break down the EPS/EPCS macromolecular matrix or that bypass and/or disable the defenses inherent in therein, thereby permitting the liquid or a component thereof to access and kill the bacteria in a down-regulated state, are particularly desirable. Such a liquid that is lethally effective while having no or very limited toxicity is of significant interest and commercial value. Methods and articles capable of treating bacteria that colonize acute wounds at the time of injury and during all stages of healing, as well as in the treatment of chronic wounds, also are highly desirable. Also of significant interest are methods, compositions capable of treating and/or remedying any of a variety of oral and mucosal conditions associated with biofilms; preventing or remedying HAIs and/or biofilms in which the microorganisms can be entrained; preventing the growth of or removing biofilms from implantable (or implanted) devices and articles; and sterilizing or otherwise processing multiuse medical equipment. ",,"The present invention is directed to compositions and articles that can be used in treatment or elimination of microbes including but not limited to bacteria, regardless of whether they are in planktonic, spore, or biofilm form. An aqueous composition according to the present invention is lethal toward a wide spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria and exhibits lethality toward other microbes such as viruses, fungi, molds, yeasts, and bacterial spores. In addition to having a pH greater than 7, the composition includes a significant amount of one or more surfactants and large amounts of osmotically active solutes. The composition is effective at interrupting or breaking ionic crosslinks in the macromolecular matrix of a biofilm, which facilitates passage of the solutes and surfactant through the matrix to the bacteria entrained therein and/or protected thereby. These ingredients, while typically ineffective against bacteria when used in isolation or at low concentrations, become very effective at breaking down the bacterial biofilm or bypassing and disabling the bacterial biofilm defenses, allowing the bacteria in its several states to be accessed and killed (by inducing membrane leakage in bacteria, leading to cell lysis) when provided in the correct combination and in sufficient concentrations. Articles, compositions and methods for treating wound areas also are provided. Non-solid compositions can be applied to the area; the composition can be non-flowing if it is intended to be left in place or can be a liquid if it is intended to irrigate or otherwise flow over or around a treatment area. A solid article can be applied to a wound treatment area; such an article can be adapted to be left in place on or near the treatment area or can be intended for temporary application and removal. An antihemorrhagic can be included in a composition or article to permit the composition or article to stanch bleeding, in addition to providing antimicrobial treatment. These aspects also provide methods of cleaning, dressing and otherwise treating wounds. Also provided are articles, compositions, and methods for protecting against or treating microbial attack of the mouth, teeth, gums, lips, oral mucosal lining, particularly attack by biofilm-related conditions including, but not limited to, oral caries, gingivitis, periodontitis, halitosis, and peri-implantitis. Further, HAIs can be prevented or remedied by applying a liquid or solid antimicrobial composition to a surface located in a medical treatment facility so as to prevent or remove a biofilm and/or kill bacterial entrained therein. A patient possessing a HAI also can be treated with an antimicrobial composition or an article including or based thereon. Additionally, the surfaces of permanently or removably implantable objects can be treated so as to prevent biofilm formation or, after implantation, can be treated to remove biofilm on such surfaces. Reusable medical equipment also can be processed so as to remove EPS/ECPS, materials conducive to the growth of EPS/ECPS, and organisms that are or can be entrained in EPS/ECPS. The processing can involve sterilization or can supplement existing sterilization techniques and results in medical equipment that is less likely to introduce microbes, particularly bacteria, into a patient treated therewith.

DETAILED ","Useful basic (caustic) liquid compositions display at least moderately high tonicity, i.e., large amounts of osmotically active solutes and a pH that is relatively high (7.5≤pH≤9) or even very high (9≤pH≤11). The large amount of solutes work with surfactants that are present to induce membrane leakage in bacteria, leading to cell lysis. The composition can contain as few as three ingredients: water, the dissociation product(s) of at least one base, and at least one surfactant, each of which generally is considered to be biocompatible. The dissociation product(s) of one or more salts also can be included. Reductions in the concentration of hydronium ions, i.e., increases in pH, generally correspond with enhanced efficacy. This effect may not be linear, i.e., the enhancement in efficacy may be asymptotic below a certain hydronium ion concentration. As long as the pH of the composition is greater than 7 and less than ˜10, the basic composition generally will be considered to be biocompatible; specifically, external exposure will result in no long-term negative dermal effects. Basicity is achieved by adding to water (or vice versa) one or more bases such as, but not limited to, alkali metal salts of weak acids including acetates, fulmates, lactates, phosphates, and glutamates; alkali metal nitrates; alkali metal hydroxides, in particular NaOH and KOH; alkali earth metal hydroxides, in particular Mg(OH)2; alkali metal borates; NH3; and alkali metal hypochlorites (e.g., NaClO) and bicarbonates (e.g., NaHCO3). In certain embodiments, preference can be given to those organic compounds which are, or can be made to be, highly soluble in water. In these and/or other embodiments, preference can be given to those bases which are biocompatible. Alternatively or additionally, preference can be given to those organic acids and bases which can act to chelate the metallic cations ionic involved in crosslinking the macromolecular matrix of a biofilm. Surfactant can be added to water before, after or at the same time as the base(s). Essentially any material having surface active properties in water can be employed, although those that bear some type of ionic charge are expected to have enhanced antimicrobial efficacy because such charges, when brought into contact with a bacteria, are believed to lead to more effective cell membrane disruption and, ultimately, to cell leakage and lysis. This type of antimicrobial process can kill even sessile bacteria because it does not involve or entail disruption of a cellular process. Potentially useful anionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, sodium chenodeoxycholate, N-lauroylsarcosine sodium salt, lithium dodecyl sulfate, 1-octanesulfonic acid sodium salt, sodium cholate hydrate, sodium deoxycholate, sodium dodecyl sulfate, sodium glycodeoxycholate, sodium lauryl sulfate, and the alkyl phosphates set forth in U.S. Pat. No. 6,610,314. Potentially useful cationic surfactants include, but are not limited to, cetylpyridinium chloride, tetradecyltrimethylammonium borime, benzalkonium chloride, hexadecylpyridinium chloride monohydrate and hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide, with the latter being a preferred material. Potentially useful nonionic surfactants include, but are not limited to, polyoxy-ethyleneglycol dodecyl ether, N-decanoyl-N-methylglucamine, digitonin, n-dodecyl B-D-maltoside, octyl B-D-glucopyranoside, octylphenol ethoxylate, polyoxyethylene (8) isooctyl phenyl ether, polyoxyethylene sorbitan monolaurate, and polyoxyethylene (20) sorbitan mono-oleate. Useful zwitterionic surfactants include but are not limited to 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-2-hydroxy-1-propane sulfonate, 3-[(3-cholamidopropyl) dimethylammonio]-1-propane sulfonate, 3-(decyldimethylammonio) propanesulfonate inner salt, and N-dodecyl-N,N-dimethyl-3-ammonio-1-propanesulfonate. For other potentially useful materials, the interested reader is directed to any of a variety of other sources including, for example, U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,107,328, 6,953,772, and 7,959,943. Particular classes and types of surfactants can be preferred for certain end use applications, with some of these being specifically referenced later in this document. The composition contains a sufficient amount of surfactant to interrupt or rupture bacterial cell walls. The amount of surfactant constitutes greater than ˜0.075%, ˜0.10%, ˜0.125%, ˜0.15% or ˜0.175%, generally at least ˜0.2%, typically at least ˜0.5%, more typically at least ˜0.7%, often at least ˜0.9%, and preferably at least 1% of the composition (all being weight percentages based on total weight of the composition), with the upper limit being defined by the solubility limits of the particular surfactant(s) chosen. Some surfactants can permit extremely high loading levels, e.g., at least 5%, at least 10%, at least 12%, at least 15%, at least 17%, at least 20%, or even on the order of ˜25% or more (again, all being weight percentages based on total weight of the composition). Any of the foregoing minimum amounts can be combined with any of the foregoing maximum amounts to provide an exemplary range of potential amounts of surfactant. Ionically charged compounds that do not qualify as a surfactants might be able to replace some or all of the surfactant component in some instances. Ionically charged compounds include natural polymers such as chitosan and glucosides, as well as charged molecules and atoms such as such as Cl−, Na+, NH4+, HCO3−, SO4−2, HSO4−, S2O3−2, SO3−2, OH−, NO3−, ClO4−, CrO4−2, Cr2O7−2, MnO4−2, PO4−3, HPO4−2, H2PO4−, and the like. These types of ions also can increase the osmolarity of a composition without increasing its pH past a desired target; see also, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,090,882. Such compounds, upon dissociation, increase the effective amount of solutes in the composition without greatly impacting the molar concentration of hydroxyl ions while, in some cases, simultaneously providing a buffer system in the composition. The lethality of the surfactant component(s) is increased and/or enhanced when the composition has at least moderate effective solute concentrations (tonicity). The osmolarity of the composition generally increases in proportion with the amount of base(s) employed, with the osmolarity maximum for a given composition primarily being a function of the solubility limits of the specific base(s). An obvious corollary to increased levels of base(s) in the composition is lower concentrations of hydronium ions, i.e., high pH values. As noted previously, some end-use applications can call for a composition with only a moderately high pH. To increase the osmolarity of a composition without increasing its pH past a desired target, one or more types of other water soluble compounds can be included. Such compounds, upon dissociation, increase the effective amount of solutes in the composition without greatly impacting the molar concentration of hydroxyl ions while, simultaneously, providing a buffer system in the composition. The ionically charged molecules and atoms discussed above are among those materials which can serve this function; see also, e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 7,090,882. Regardless of how achieved, the tonicity of the composition is at least moderately high, with an osmolarity of at least ˜0.3, ˜0.5, ˜0.7, ˜0.8, ˜0.9 or ˜1 Osm/L being preferred for most applications. Depending on particular end-use application, the composition can have any of the following concentrations: at least ˜1.5 Osm, at least ˜1.75 Osm/L, at least ˜2.0 Osm/L, at least ˜2.25 Osm/L, at least ˜2.5 Osm/L, at least ˜2.75 Osm/L, at least ˜3.0 Osm/L, at least ˜3.25 Osm/L, at least ˜3.5 Osm/L, at least ˜3.75 Osm/L, at least ˜4.0 Osm/L, and even at least ˜4.25 Osm/L. Certain embodiments of the composition can exhibit solute concentrations of 0.3 to 5 Osm/L, 0.5 to 4.5 Osm/L, 0.75 to 4.4 Osm/L, 1 to 4.3 Osm/L, 1.25 to 4.25 Osm/L, 1.4 to 4.1 Osm/L, and 1.5 to 4 Osm/L; other potentially useful ranges include 3 to 5 Osm/L, 2.5 to 4.5 Osm/L, 3 to 4.5 Osm/L, 3.5 to 5 Osm/L, 3.25 to 4.5 Osm/L, and the like. The composition can be employed in a variety of ways. For example, when used to treat a biofilm on a surface (e.g., cutting board, counter, desk, etc.), the composition can be applied directly to the biofilm, optionally followed by physical rubbing or buffing, or the composition can be applied to the rubbing/buffing medium, e.g., cloth. Where a biofilm in an inaccessible area is to be treated, soaking or immersion of the biofilm in an excess of the composition can be performed for a time sufficient to essentially solvate the biofilm, which then can be flushed or wiped from the affected area. Regardless of contact method, the surfactant compo-nent(s) are believed to kill significant numbers of bacteria without a need for the bacteria to be removed from the biofilm or vice versa. Due to the abundance of microbial contamination, the composition may find utility in a large number of potential uses including, but not limited to, household applications including non-compromised skin (hand, foot, hair, and body washing and/or deodorization), kitchen cleaning (countertop and surface cleaning, cleaning of food preparation utensils, dish washing, produce washing, etc.), bathroom cleaning (countertop and surface cleaning, fixture cleaning, toilet bowl cleaning, sink and floor drain cleaning, and shower mildew eradication), laundry area cleaning (including laundry detergent, linen disinfection, and diaper sterilization), baby sensitive applications such as cleaning and or disinfecting baby contact products (including toys, bottles, pacifiers, nipples, teething rings, diapers, blankets, and clothing); commercial applications include livestock care (facility and equipment sterilization and dairy teat dip), produce sterilization (an alternative to irradiation, which can be particularly useful against E. coli, listeria, salmonella, botulism, etc.), meat and poultry processing facilities (including all surfaces, floors and drains, processing equipment and carcass washing), commercial kitchen and food preparation facilities (countertop and surface cleaning, food preparation utensil cleaning, storage equipment and facilities cleaning, dish washing and produce washing), mass food and beverage processing (processing and storage equipment cleaning, tank sterilization, cleaning of liquid transport lines, etc.), cleaning of water lines (e.g., for drinking water, beverage dispensers, dental offices, plumbing, heat exchanging systems, and the like), and food and beverage transport (cleaning of tanker units for semi transport, cleaning of tanker cars for railroad transport, and cleaning of pipelines); and non-traditional uses such as denture cleaning, acne treatment, spermi-cides, laboratory equipment cleaning, laboratory surface cleaning, oil pipeline cleaning, and test article processing for biofilm attachment. The composition can be prepared in a number of ways. Description of an exemplary method follows. Base (e.g., NaOH) and optional solute (e.g., a phosphate or sulfate) are combined with sufficient water to constitute 60-90% of the calculated desired volume. This solution can be stirred and/or heated. The desired amount of surfactant(s) then can be added. Once stirring, if used, is complete, sufficient water is added so as to bring the composition to the calculated tonicity and pH value. Advantageously, no special conditions or containers are needed to store the composition for an extended time, although refrigeration can be used if desired. A variety of additives and adjuvants can be included to make a composition more amenable for use in a particular end-use application without negatively affecting its efficacy in a substantial manner. Examples include, but are not limited to, emollients, fungicides, fragrances, pigments, dyes, defoamers, foaming agents, flavors, abrasives, bleaching agents, preservatives (e.g., antioxidants) and the like. The composition does not require inclusion of an active antimicrobial agent for efficacy, but such materials can be included in certain embodiments. For example, one or more of bleach, any of a variety of phenols, aldehydes, quaternary ammonium compounds, etc., can be added. The composition conveniently can be provided as a solution, although other forms might be desirable for certain end-use applications. Accordingly, the composition can provided as a soluble powder (for subsequent dilution, an option which can reduce transportation costs), a slurry, or a thicker form such as a gel or paste (which might be particularly useful for providing increased residence times). For the latter, the composition can include additional ingredients such as a coalescent (e.g., polyvinylpyrrolidone). Embodiments of the composition can provide very large reductions in the number of bacteria, even with extremely short residence times. For example, a composition having high concentrations of surfactant (e.g., 1.5-2.5% by wt.) and total solutes (e.g., 2-4 Osm/L) can provide a 2, 3 or 4 log (99.99%) reduction in the number of bacteria in an entrenched biofilm with a 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, or 10 minute residence time and a 3, 4, 5, or 6 log (99.9999%) reduction in the number of planktonic bacteria with a mere 30-second residence time. Quantitative Carrier Testing (ASTM E2197) is designed to determine the contact time necessary to eradicate from a surface (e.g., countertops, sinks, bathroom fixtures, and the like) bacteria in a soil-loaded inoculum. In this test, bacteria combined with a soil loading and a 10 μL inoculum is placed on a stainless steel carrier disk. After the inoculate is allowed to dry completely, 50 μL of antimicrobial treatment composition is applied and allowed to stay in place for the desired treatment time, after which dilution with a saline dilution is performed. In addition to the foregoing general uses for the caustic composition of the present invention, certain specific end uses can employ the caustic antimicrobial composition, its acidic counterpart or, in some instances, a solid antimicrobial material. The following paragraphs set forth information about an acidic antimicrobial composition and a solid antimicrobial material, as well as specific novel end uses for such compositions and materials. Potentially useful acidic liquid compositions include those described in the aforementioned U.S. Pat. Nos. 7,976,873, 7,976,875, and 7,993,675 as well as U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2010/0086576 A1, all of which include large amounts of osmotically active solutes. A primary difference among the liquid compositions is pH, with those intended for use in the ear or sinus cavity being very moderate (e.g., commonly about 6≤pH≤7), and those intended for surface disinfection being more extreme, e.g., relatively low (about 3≤pH≤6). An acidic antimicrobial composition can contain as few as three ingredients: water, the dissociation product(s) of at least one acid, and at least one surfactant, each of which generally is considered to be biocompatible. The dissociation product(s) of one or more alkali metal salts of organic acids also can be included. Increases in the concentration of hydronium ions, i.e., decreases in pH, generally correspond with enhanced efficacy and, again, the effect may not be linear, i.e., the enhancement in efficacy may be asymptotic past a certain hydronium ion concentration. As long as the pH of the composition is greater than ˜3, the composition generally will be biocompatible; specifically, external exposure will result in no long-term negative dermal effects. Acidity is achieved by adding to water (or vice versa) one or more acids, specifically strong (mineral) acids such as HCl, H2SO4, H3PO4, HNO3, H3BO3, and the like or, preferably, organic acids, particularly organic polyacids. Examples of organic acids include mono-protic acids such as formic acid, acetic acid and substituted variants, propanoic acid and substituted variants (e.g., lactic acid, pyruvic acid, and the like), any of a variety of benzoic acids (e.g., mandelic acid, chloromandelic acid, salicylic acid, and the like), glucuronic acid, and the like; diprotic acids such as oxalic acid and substituted variants (including oxamic acid), butanedioic acid and substituted variants (e.g., malic acid, aspartic acid, tartaric acid, citramalic acid, and the like), pentanedioic acid and substituted variants (e.g., glutamic acid, 2-ketoglutaric acid, and the like), hexanedioic acid and substituted variants (e.g., mucic acid), butenedioic acid (both cis and trans isomers), iminodiacetic acid, phthalic acid, ketopimelic acid, and the like; triprotic acids such as citric acid, 2-methylpropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylic acid, benzenetricarboxylic acid, nitrilo-triacetic acid, and the like; tetraprotic acids such as prehnitic acid, pyromellitic acid, and the like; and even higher degree acids (e.g., penta-, hexa-, heptaprotic, etc.). Where a tri-, tetra-, or higher acid is used, one or more of the carboxyl protons can be replaced by cationic atoms or groups (e.g., alkali metal ions), which can be the same or different. In certain embodiments, preference can be given to those organic acids which are, or can be made to be, highly soluble in water; acids that include groups that enhance solubility in water (e.g., hydroxyl groups), examples of which include tartaric acid, citric acid, and citramalic acid, can be preferred in some circumstances. In these and/or other embodiments, preference can be given to those organic acids which are biocompatible; many of the organic acids listed above are used in preparing or treating food products, personal care products, and the like. Alternatively or additionally, preference can be given to those organic acids which can act to chelate the metallic cations ionic involved in crosslinking the macromolecular matrix of a biofilm. This is discussed in more detail below. Surfactant can be added to water before, after or at the same time as the acid(s). As with the basic antimicrobial composition, those surfactants that bear some type of ionic charge are expected to yield enhanced antimicrobial efficacy; such charges, when brought into contact with a bacterium, are believed to lead to more effective cell membrane disruption and, ultimately, to cell leakage and lysis. Potentially useful surfactants are the same as those described previously, with non-ionic and cationic surfactants being at least somewhat preferred where the composition is intended for contact with dermal tissue. The amounts of such surfactants that can be employed in the acidic antimicrobial composition are the same as those described above in connection with the basic antimicrobial composition. The lethality of the surfactant component(s) is increased and/or enhanced when the composition has at least moderate effective solute concentrations (tonicity). The osmolarity of the composition generally increases in proportion with the amount of acid(s) employed, with the osmolarity maximum for a given composition primarily being a function of the solubility limits of the specific acid(s). An obvious corollary to increased levels of acid(s) in the composition is higher concentrations of hydronium ions, i.e., low pH values. As noted previously, some end-use applications can call for a composition with only a moderately low pH. To increase the osmolarity of a composition without decreasing its pH past a desired target, one or more types of other water soluble compounds can be included. Such compounds, upon dissociation, increase the effective amount of solutes in the composition without greatly impacting the molar concentration of hydronium ions while, simultaneously, providing a buffer system in the composition. The materials and methods for enhancing tonicity, as well as the osmolarities of the resulting compositions, are the same as those described above in connection with the basic antimicrobial composition. Where one or more organic acids are used in the composition, tonicity can be increased by including salt(s) of those acid(s) or other acid(s). For example, where the composition includes x moles of an acid, a many fold excess (e.g., 3×-10×, preferably at least 5× or even at least 8×) of one or more salts of that acid also can be included. Both the basic and acidic antimicrobial liquid compositions have been described primarily as solutions, although this is not limiting. Additional forms include emulsions, gels (including hydrogels, organogels and xerogels), pastes (i.e., suspension in an organic, typically fatty, base), salves or ointments, aerosols, foams, and even suspensions. Solid articles intended for use in disinfecting applications are described in U.S. Pat. Publ. No. 2012/0288469 A1. Solid materials include a crosslinked version of a water soluble polyelectrolyte and entrained surfactant. This combination of components permits the local chemistry within and immediately surrounding the solid material, when in use in an aqueous environment, to mimic that of the acidic versions of the aforedescribed liquid composition: high tonicity and high surfactant concentration. The solid material can, but need not, include biocidal additives, particularly active antimicrobial agents. When a liquid is passed through or in proximity to the solid material, any bacteria or other microorganisms are exposed to the local chemistry conditions discussed above: high tonicity, relatively low pH, and available surfactant, a combination that can induce membrane leakage in bacteria, leading to cell lysis. These characteristics permit the solid material to be effective at bypassing and disabling bacterial biofilm and spore defenses. In addition to being lethal toward a wide spectrum of gram positive and gram negative bacteria, the solid materials also can exhibit lethality toward other microbes such as viruses, fungi, molds, and yeasts. The solid material requires some level of water or humidity to function effectively. This can be determined or defined in a variety of ways. The polyelectrolytes must be capable of localized liquid charge interaction (meaning at least two water molecules are contacting or very near an electrolyte group); alternatively, sufficient water must be present to activate the charge of the electrolyte and/or permit bacterial growth. A solid antimicrobial material does not itself have a true pH. In use, however, the local pH of any aqueous composition in which it is deployed preferably is lower than ˜7 to ensure proper antimicrobial activity. Reduced pH values (e.g., less than ˜6.5, ˜6.0, ˜5.5, ˜5.0, ˜4.5 and even ˜4.0) generally are believed to correlate with increases in efficacy of the solid material, although this effect might be asymptotic for reasons described above. In addition to more strongly acidic local environments, high local osmolarity conditions also are believed to increase efficacy. Accordingly, larger concentrations of polyelectrolytes, larger concentrations of surfactant, surfactants with shorter chain lengths (e.g., no more than C10, typically no more than C8, commonly no more than C6), and surfactants with smaller side groups around the polar group each are more desirable. (These factors also are applicable to the previously described liquid compositions.) The lethality of the surfactant component(s) is increased and/or enhanced when the solid material can provide to the local environment in which it is deployed at least moderate effective solute concentrations, similar to that described above. Local osmolarity (tonicity) generally increases in proportion to the number and type of electrolytes present in the polymeric network. (By local osmolarity is meant that of a liquid contained in the solid material. While this might vary from place to place throughout the article, preference is given to those solid materials capable of providing high local osmolarities throughout.) The polyelectrolyte(s) that form the bulk of the solid material preferably are at least somewhat water soluble but also essentially water insoluble after being crosslinked. A partial list of polyelectrolytes having this combination of characteristics includes, but are not limited to, strong polyelectrolytes such as polysodium styrene sulfonate and weak polyelectrolytes such as polyacrylic acid, pectin, carrageenan, any of a variety of alginates, polyvinylpyrrolidone, carboxymethylchitosan, and carboxymethylcellulose. Included in potentially useful poly-amphyolytes are amino acids and betaine-type crosslinked networks; examples would be hydrogels based on sodium acrylate and trimethylmethacryloyloxyethylammonium iodide, 2-hydroxy-ethylmethacrylate, or 1-vinyl-3(3-sulfopropyl)imidazolium betaine. Those polymeric materials having electrolyte groups that completely (or nearly completely) dissociate in water and/or provide relatively low local pH values are desired for efficacy are preferred. Also preferred are those polyelectrolytes having a high density of mer with electrolyte-containing side groups. Several crosslinking mechanisms including but not limited to chemical, high temperature self-crosslinking, and irradiation can be employed in forming the solid material. Another option is to create crosslinks during the polymerization process itself, such as by con-densing adjacent sulfonic acid groups to yield sulfonyl crosslinks. Solid materials with higher crosslink densities tend to maintain higher surfactant concentrations for a longer period of time due to, presumably, longer mean free paths in the polymeric network. Independent of crosslinking method, the solid material can be formed by crosslinking polymers (or polymerizable monomers) in an aqueous solution contained in a heat conductive mold, followed by rapid freezing and subsequent lyophilizing. The resulting sponge-like material generally takes the shape of the mold in which it was formed. Solids resulting from this type of process often have a spongy appearance, with relatively large pores connected by tortuous paths. Often, pores less than ˜0.22 μm, less than ˜0.45 μm, less than ˜0.80 μm, and less than ˜0.85 μm are desirable (based on the diameters of endotoxins, bacteria, and spores); for these and other applications, a solid material with at least some larger pores (e.g., less than ˜1, 2, 5, 10, 50, or 100 μm) can be used. The solid material contains a sufficient amount of surfactant to interrupt or rupture cell walls of bacteria contacting or coming into the vicinity of the solid material. The surfactant component(s) generally constitute as low as ˜0.03% and as high as ˜10%, ˜15% or even ˜17.5% (all by wt.) of the solid material. The same types of surface active materials discussed previously also can be used in this form. The surfactant preferably is present in the polymer network at the time that crosslinking occurs (or the time of polymerization in the case of the type of simultaneous polymerization and condensation discussed above). If it is not, a crosslinked polymer article or film must be post-treated to ensure proper entrainment of the surfactant. A possible method for accomplishing this is immersion of the article or film in a solution, typically but not always aqueous, that contains one or more surfactants, followed by removal of excess water via a drying (e.g., thermal or freeze) or evacuation process. In addition to the surfactant(s), one or more ionic compounds (salts) can be incorporated into the solid material so as to enhance its ability to create localized regions of high tonicity. Regardless of how achieved, the local tonicity around the solid material is at least moderately high, with an osmolarity of at least ˜0.1 Osm/L being preferred for most applications. Solid materials that create local tonicities greater than ˜0.1 Osm/L will have enhanced bactericidal activity with further increases in the osmotic pressure providing further enhanced antimicrobial efficacy. The solid material can take any of a variety of intermediate and final shapes or forms including, but are not limited to, a spongy solid that is permeable to vapor and or liquids; a molded, extruded or deposited sheet; a coating on a surface or layer in a multilayer structure; and an extruded fiber or thread. Once in a particular shape, the material then can be further processed or manipulated so as to provide a desired shape, e.g., a sheet good can be rolled or folded so as to provide a membrane of a particular geometry or a larger solid can be ground into a powder. Both the liquid and solid forms can act at least in part to interrupt or break ionic crosslinks in the macromolecular matrix of a biofilm, facilitating the passage of solutes and surfactant through the matrix to bacteria entrained therein and/or protected thereby. Both forms also typically do not involve C1-C4 alcohols, yet can result, after no more than 10 minutes residence time, in at least 6 log (99.9999%) reductions in the number of bacteria in an entrenched biofilm. Embodiments of the composition which are non-toxic if ingested can result, after no more than 10 minutes residence time, in at least 2 log (99%), 3 log (99.9%) or 4 log (99.99%) reductions in the number of bacteria in an entrenched biofilm. In the discussion of particular applications of the previously described compositions and solid materials, terms such as “low,” “moderate,” and “high” are used in connection with properties such as toxicity and efficacy. Toxicity refers to negative effects on biological tissues or systems, with low toxicity referring to little or no irritation even upon repeated applications, high LD50 values, little or no cytotoxicity, and/or no systemic toxicity, and high toxicity referring to irritation upon repeated exposure, low LD50 values, and/or moderate-to-high cytotoxicity; toxicity generally increases with increasing surfactant concentration, increasing tonicity, and/or departure of pH from neutral. Efficacy refers to lethality against microbes and/or ability to disrupt or even remove the EPS/ECPS in which certain bacterial colonies reside, with low efficacy referring to <2 log, or even <1 log reduction in bacteria (particularly those in an entrenched biofilm) and high efficacy referring to >2 log, >3 log, >4 log, >5 log and even >6 log reductions in bacteria; efficacy generally increases with departures of pH from neutral, surfactant loading increases, tonicity increases, and optimization of surfactant architecture (e.g., higher charge potentials, smaller groups near a charged site, smaller hydrophilic sites, etc.) or type (i.e., cationic>zwitterionic>anionic>non-ionic). Wounds A number of pathogenic bacteria often are present in and around wounds. Gram positive bacteria include Enterococcus faecalis, Staphylococcus epidermidis, and Staphylococcus aureus. Gram negative bacteria include Klebsiella pneumonia, Acinetobacter baumanii, Haemophilus influenza, Burkholderia cenocepacia, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Various fungi also can be present in burn wounds. Wound colonization often occurs in stages, with bacterial flora in the wound changing over time. Initially, wounds are colonized by aerobic gram positive cocci, such as S. aureus, S. epidermidis, Streptococcus spp., and Enterococcus spp., followed by gram negative rods such as P. aeruginosa, E. coli, K pneumoniae, and A. baumannii. The wound later is colonized by anaerobic species such as Prevotella spp., and Porphorymonas spp. Bacteria can colonize a wound and form a biofilm having mixed species communities of aerobic bacteria near the surface and anaerobic bacteria deeper in the biofilm. Biofilms are a major, perhaps primary, factor in making a wound chronic and preventing healing because neither the body's natural defenses or antibiotics are able to eradicate bacteria in a biofilm. Additional reasons that wound infections can be difficult to treat include the avascular nature of wound eschars and the presence of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. Human and animal wounds can classified as (1) acute, which includes skin abrasions, surgical incisions, trauma, and burns, or (2) chronic, which includes diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, and venous arterial ulcers. Acute wounds generally heal through an orderly and timely regenerative process with sequential, yet somewhat overlapping, stages of healing: haemostasis, inflammation, and regeneration and repair. In haemostasis, damaged endothelial lining exposes platelets to sub-endothelial collagen, which then releases von Willebrand factor and tissue thromboplastin. The von Willebrand factor facilitates platelet adhesion to sub-endothelial collagen and the adhered platelets release ADP and thromboxane A2, which leads to further platelet aggregation. Tissue thromboplastin then activates the coagulation pathways, leading to the formation of fibrin, which forms a plug into which platelets and red blood cells are trapped, thereby leading to clot formation. In inflammation, platelets release platelet-derived growth factor and transformation growth factor β, which are chemotactic to neutrophils and monocytes. Neutrophils and macro-phages phagocytose foreign material and bacteria. Platelet-derived growth factor and transformation growth factors are mitogenic to epithelium and fibroblasts. In the regeneration and repair phase, this leads to proliferation of epithelial cells and fibroblasts, which produce collagen. Vascular endothelial growth factor is mitogenic to endothelial cells, and it is released by monocytes in response to hypoxia and promotes angiogenesis. During the first 24 hours of the healing process in acute wounds, neutrophils are the predominant cell type; this is the acute inflammation phase where epithelial cells start proliferating and migrating into the wound cavity. Over the next 24-48 hours, where macro-phage and fibroblasts are the dominant cell types, epithelial cell proliferation and migration continues and angiogenesis begins. Granulation tissue appears and collagen fibers are present but are vertical and do not bridge the wound gap. Granulation tissue includes newly formed capillary loops. By the end of fifth day, the predominant cell type is fibroblasts, which synthesize collagen to bridge the wound edges. Epidermal cells continue to divide, the epidermis becomes multilayered, and abundant granulation tissue is present. During the second week, acute inflammation subsides, and collagen continues to accumulate. The foregoing is inapplicable to burns and chronic wounds. In burn wounds, the lack of a protective barrier due to the injury often results in septic infections. In chronic wounds, the wound fails to proceed through an orderly progression, causing the wound to remain in the inflammation phase of the healing process. The forms that the treatment can take, the stages of a wound that can benefit from a treatment, the types and forms of bacteria present in the wound, and the portions of the wound and surrounding skin that can be treated all are indicative of the breadth of the present invention. Each possible combination of variables cannot be described individually; instead, many of the variables will be discussed separately, and the ordinarily skilled artisan is capable of combining these individual descriptions to provide for a given form that can be used in or near a particular type of wound at a particular stage of the healing process. Wound Types Both chronic and acute wounds can affect only the epidermis and dermis or can affect tissue down to the fascia. Chronic wounds, which primarily affect humans although also occur with horses, most often are caused by poor circulation, neuropathy, and lack of mobility, although other factors such as systemic illness (including infection and diabetes), age, repeated trauma and co-morbid ailments such as vasculitis, pyoderma gangrenosum, neoplasia, metabolic disorders, and diseases that cause ischemia (e.g., chronic fibrosis, atherosclerosis, edema, sickle cell disease, arterial insufficiency-related illnesses, etc.) or that suppress the immune system. All of these can act to overwhelm the body's ability to deal with wound damage via the common healing process be disrupting the precise balance between production and degradation of molecules such as collagen seen in acute wounds, with degradation playing a disproportionately large a role. Many of the aforementioned causes result in inadequate tissue oxygenation, leading to a higher risk for infection. The immune response to the presence of bacteria prolongs inflammation and delays healing, leading to a chronic wound and damaged tissue. Bacterial colonization and infection damage tissue by causing a greater number of neutrophils to enter the wound site. Although neutrophils fight pathogens, they also release inflammatory cytokines and enzymes that damage cells as well as produce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) to kill bacteria; enzymes and ROS produced by neutrophils and other leukocytes damage cells and prevent cell proliferation and wound closure by damaging DNA, lipids, proteins, the extracellular matrix, and cytokines that facilitate healing. Neutrophils remain in chronic wounds longer than in acute wounds and contribute to the fact that chronic wounds have higher levels of inflammatory cytokines and ROS, and chronic wound fluid has an excess of proteases and ROS, so the fluid itself interferes with healing by inhibiting cell growth and breaking down growth factors and proteins in the extracellular matrix. Chronic wounds typically are classified as diabetic ulcers, venous ulcers and pressure ulcers, although a small number of wounds not falling into one these categories can be caused by, for example, radiation poisoning or ischemia. Generally accepted wisdom is that disinfectants are contraindicated for the treatment of chronic wounds. This belief is based on a variety of factors, including the potential to damage tissue, potential delay in wound contraction, and general ineffectiveness in the presence of organic matter, e.g., blood and exudates. An acute wound results from a force that exceeds the resistive strength of the skin and/or underlying supporting tissues, resulting in an abrasion, puncture, laceration, or incision. Most acute wounds result from a trauma, with most of the remainder resulting from a medical procedure, e.g., surgery. Surgical wounds commonly are classified on a sliding scale that ranges from clean to contaminated to dirty, with surgical wounds that are contaminated or dirty (or known to be infected) occasionally being left open for treatment prior to being sutured. Surgical wounds almost always are dressed, with dressing selection based on the amount of exudate to be absorbed (leakage of exudate onto surrounding skin can cause blistering, particularly in the area under the dressing), supporting haemostasis and protecting against infection. Wound Treatment Fundamental wound care protocol involves cleansing (i.e., removal of debris and softening of necrotic tissue), possible debridement, absorbing excess exudate, promoting granulation and epithelialization, and treating infection. The cleansing agents used at this stage tend to be based on surfactants targeted at physical removal of dirt and bacteria with very little (if any) killing of bacteria being effected. Common treatments for wounds involve dressing changes, medicated dressings, and cleansing or debridement. These often are combined with systemic and/or topical antibiotics which, unfortunately, are ineffective when treating bacteria in a biofilm due to their sessile state. (Orders of magnitude more antibiotic(s) are needed to kill bacteria in a biofilm, an amount which makes most/all antibiotics toxic to the host.) Changing dressings to dry ones, if performed, can be a means of mechanical debridement which causes injury to new tissue growth, causes pain, predisposes a wound to infection, becomes a foreign body and delays healing time. Debridement is performed for necrotic tissue and infection in the wound. This can be accomplished by multiple methods, including mechanical, autolytic, surgical, enzymatic or biochemical, or biological. Hydrogels are often applied to wounds to keep them hydrated. Negative pressure wound therapy can be used to pull bacteria from a wound. Hyperbaric chambers can also be used to attempt to improve wound healing. Topical application of an antibacterial product such as alcohols, H2O2, povidone-iodine and dilute HClO, sometimes is performed to control bacterial load. A number of gels and dressing are marketed for the treatment of infections in wounds, including antibacterial silver-loaded gels, calcium fiber gels and alginates (which entrap bacteria). None of these are effective against biofilms, however, and therefore are not effective in treating many wounds. As mentioned previously acute wounds generally heal through an orderly, multi-stage regenerative process that includes haemostasis, inflammation, and regeneration/repair. The aforementioned compositions and solid materials can be useful in treatments at each of these stages. Further, the treatments can be targeted at preventing bacterial colonization, including the formation of biofilms, or at treating an infection, including in biofilm form, in or near a wound. Concurrent with or soon after wound formation, the wound and surrounding skin can be treated so as to minimize the risk of infection. This treatment can be effected by cleansing the area with a liquid composition or by contacting the area with a solid form carrier such as, for example, a topical wipe. At this stage, long term exposure to the treating medium is not expected, so increasing efficacy at the cost of reducing biocompatibility is acceptable. Efficacy can be bolstered by increasing osmolarity, pushing the pH farther from neutral and/or using more aggressive surfactants. For example, liquid compositions (which includes semi-solid materials such as gels, salves and balms) intended for immediate removal or topical wipes intended for use in field situations where other treatment will not be immediate can have a relatively extreme pH (e.g., 2 to 4 or 10 to 12), whereas liquid compositions not intended for immediate removal and topical wipes intended for use in situations other than extreme situations can have an intermediate pH (e.g., 4 to 5 or 9 to 10), and liquid compositions not intended to be removed, or compositions/wipes intended for use with children or small animals, can have a gentle pH (e.g., 5 to 6.5 or 7.5 to 9). In addition to or instead of pushing pH farther from neutral, a topical composition also can have a very high osmolarity and/or surfactant loading. Particularly because biofilms are unlikely to have formed at such an early stage, the need for H3O+ or OH− ions to assist in breaking up the EPS/ECPS macromolecular matrix might not be as great and, accordingly, higher loadings of other solutes, buffers and/or surfactants might be sufficient to provide significant lethality against many types of bacteria in planktonic form. For example, at this stage of wound care, a liquid composition with an osmolarity greater than ˜300 mOsm/L and a surfactant loading greater than ˜0.075% (by wt.) often can be adequate for preventing biofilm growth. Adjusting the osmolarity and/or surfactant loading upward (using the amounts provided previously) can provide more effective (i.e., biocidal) compositions, but at the cost of potential for skin irritation. For biocompatibility reasons, non-ionic and cationic surfactants (particularly benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride) are preferred. A variety of grades of liquid antimicrobial compositions for wound care also are envisioned. For example, over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription (Rx) or professional grades can be provided having compositions and properties such as those shown in the following table:

 Liquid antimicrobial compositions can be applied directly or can be delivered and continuously removed, e.g., fed via an instrument like a debrider (e.g., any of the Pulsavac Plus™ family of products, commercially available from Zimmer Inc., Warsaw, Ind.) or even a syringe with a special flow restriction (increased pressure) tip. Also, a liquid composition or one of the foregoing additional (solid or semi-solid, particularly gels including those based on any of a variety of PEGs) forms can be used to provide articles with disinfectant properties such as sponges, topical wipes, bandages, pads, gauze, surgical packing, and the like. In addition to being applied to a wounded area to halt or prevent microbial infection, embodiments of a liquid composition (including gels and foams) or a topical wipe can be used to disinfect the skin of those treating the wound as well as the instruments used in that treatment including, but not limited to, syringes, debriders, tourniquets, and the like. Certain types of wounds, patients and/or treatments argue for the inclusion of other types of materials in or with the disinfecting composition or material. Non-limiting examples of such materials include, but are not limited to, emollients, lotions, humectants, glycosaminogly-cans such as hyaluronic acid, analgesics (e.g., pramoxine, lidocaine, capsaicin, isobutylpropano-icphenolic acid, etc.), colloidal silver (for treatment of burns) and antimicrobials including sporicides, antifungals, antibiotics (e.g., bacitracin, neomycin, polymyxin B, etc.), fragrances, preservatives (e.g., antioxidants), and the like. Adding an antihemorrhagic to the disinfecting (antimicrobial) composition or material, or adding the disinfectant to an antihemorrhagic, is potentially quite useful. Examples of common antihemorrhagic materials used in military and emergency medical settings include fibrin, collagen oxidized starch, carboxymethyl cellulose, thrombin and chitosan. Various embodiments of the disinfecting composition or material can be added to an antihemorrhagic material or article such as a haemostatic bandage (HemCon Medical Technologies, Inc.; Portland, Oreg.), Tisseel™ fibrin sealant (Baxter International Inc.; Deerfield, Ill.), Thrombi-Gel™ gelatin foam hemostat (Pfizer Inc.; New York, N.Y.), GelFoam™ gelatin sponge (Pfizer), GelFoam™ Plus haemostasis kit (Baxter), and the like; alternatively, addition of an antihemorrhagic material to a liquid disinfecting composition or to a solid disinfecting material or article also can be useful. For purpose of exemplification, addition of at least ˜5%, often at least ˜10%, commonly at least ˜20% of disinfecting composition or material in solid or semisolid antihemorrhagic materials (e.g., gel-foam and chitosan bandages). Conversely, from ˜1 to ˜80% (by wt.), commonly from ˜3 to ˜70% (by wt.), and typically from ˜5 to ˜60% antihemorrhagic material (with the amount varying primarily based on the identity and efficacy of the antihemorrhagic, e.g., thrombin, chitosan, oxidized cellulose, or carboxymethyl cellulose) can be added to or incorporated in a disinfecting composition or material. Embodiments of the foregoing are expected to find utility in military battlefield (e.g., pourable powders carried by field medics) and emergency medical applications (e.g., EMT and ambulance kits as well as surgical theater usages), where disinfecting capability (efficacy) preferably is high, e.g., high osmolarity and surfactant levels. Blood and wound fluid can hydrate a solid material or a concentrated liquid composition, so levels of water or other carrier can be kept low. Other embodiments are expected to find utility in connection with less traumatic wounds, such as shaving cuts or improperly trimmed animal nails, where an embodiment of the liquid or solid disinfecting material might be added to a styptic such as alum or TiO2. From the foregoing, the ordinarily skilled artisan can envision numerous articles, techniques and ways in which wounds can be cleansed. Embodiments of the previously described liquid compositions and solid materials also can be used at during various stages of the wound healing process. As described in more detail above, wounds are believed to heal via a process that involves haemostasis, inflammation, and repair and/or regeneration. During these phases, a variety of topical medicaments and articles are applied to wounds and surrounding areas, some for brief periods of time and others for an extended duration. For example, many wounds are bandaged soon after occurrence and, in certain circumstances, re-bandaged over time. A bandage that includes an embodiment of the liquid composition can help to prevent infection, treat infection, prevent biofilms, or break up a biofilm and kill the bacteria entrained therein. In this particular form, a strong disinfecting composition (high osmolarity and relatively extreme pH, e.g., ˜3.5 to 5 or ˜9 to 10.5) can be preferable because high efficacy and microbial toxicity are desired and because the bandage typically only overlays the wound. Methods of making such a bandage include soaking bandage material in a liquid composition or by coating or entraining in the bandage material a gel, optionally one that undergoes a temperature-based phase change, i.e., becomes less viscous between ˜25° to ˜40° C. (Alternatively, some PEG-based gels themselves can act as bandages.) Tailoring the elution rate of the disinfecting composition over the expected use period of the bandage can be desirable. Alternatively, an embodiment of a solid form disinfectant can be used to provide a bandage. The solid article can be in as-made form (e.g., spongy solid) or in further processed form (e.g., a fiber made from a solid). Here, the bandage material itself is antimicrobial, although such a material certainly can be further loaded with additional composition or with other antimicrobials. A variation on the foregoing theme involves surgical packing, which is structurally similar to a bandage although typically is intended for insertion into the body for a limited time or to be bioresorbed within a predetermined amount of time. The method of making a surgical packing is essentially the same as those set out above with respect to bandages, although the efficacy and toxicity levels and/or the elution rate can be downwardly adjusted. Ongoing wound treatment sometimes involve repeated applications of a gel, paste or salve directly to the wound. Because of the amount of time that such materials are allowed to reside on or in the wound, these materials typically involve gentle or only moderately strong disinfecting composition embodiments. In other words, efficacy and toxicity can be reduced to avoid pain or tissue damage, a sacrifice that is offset by the proximity of the treatment to the wound and its length of contact. Both bandages and topical treatments can be used in connection with burn wounds. In such circumstances, addition of a variety of adjuvants and additional treatments can be preferable. Potentially useful adjuvants include colloidal silver, analgesics, antifungals, emollients, hyaluronic acid, and the like. Because wound edema is common, a somewhat concentrated, even solid, form of topically applied disinfectant can be used. Similarly, both bandages and topical treatments can be used in connection with diabetic and pressure ulcers, i.e., chronic wounds. Similar adjuvants, particularly analgesics, hyaluronic acid, and emollients, can be included in embodiments intended for this use. Embodiments of the liquid composition also can find utility in connection with debridement techniques and equipment. Specifically, such liquid compositions can be used to irrigate or flush an area prior to, simultaneously with, or immediately after debridement. While most of the foregoing embodiments have been described as single use, articles intended for multiple applications are envisioned. These are expected to have high loading levels that are intended to elute over time. Oral Care The oral environment initially changes due to an increased concentration of carbohydrates in the diet of the host. The anaerobic bacteria in the plaque biofilm produce acid by fermenting these carbohydrates, thus reducing the pH of the biofilm; some of the more common bacteria responsible for this shift in composition include S. mutans, S. sorbrinus, and Lactobacillus casei, all of which can survive at a pH level as low as 3.0. As the pH drops, the microflora shift towards acid-tolerant bacteria, as intolerant bacteria cannot survive in the acidic conditions formed. At highly acidic pH, the acid-tolerant bacterial biofilm can de-mineralize the tooth enamel, with greater degrees of acidity causing faster rates of demineralization. (Demineralization of tooth enamel can also occur solely from the presence of highly acidic substances in the oral cavity.) Caries result if demineralization persists at a rate greater than re-mineralization occurs. S. mutans, Lactobacilli, Lactobacillus acidophilus, Actinomyces viscosus, Nocardia spp., and Streptococcus sanguis are most closely associated with oral caries but, because most plaque-induced oral diseases occur with a diverse microflora present, the specific causal species is not known. Plaque and tartar (hardened plaque) become more harmful the longer that they remain on the teeth. The bacteria within the biofilm cause inflammation of the gums, commonly known as gingivitis, a mild form of gum disease that does not include any loss of bone and tissue holding the teeth in place. Spirochetes, Actinomyces naeslundii, and P. gingivalis are often associated with the gingivitis. Untreated gingivitis progresses to inflammation around the tooth, commonly known as periodontitis, a condition where the gums retract from the teeth and form gaps or pockets that can become infected because they are easily colonized by microbes due to dentinal tubules and enamel fissures that lead directly into the gums; the biofilm plaque spreads and grows below the gum line. The majority of the bacteria within the microflora in these gum pockets are gram-negative anaerobes, although the identity of the microbes in the biofilm change as the biofilm itself changes. At a certain point, the organisms must disperse to other locations in the oral cavity to ensure survival. Periodontitis involves progressive loss of the alveolar bone around the teeth and the connective tissue that holds the teeth in place due to the bacterial toxins in the biofilm and the body's immune response to the biofilm. If left untreated, this can lead to loosening and subsequent loss of teeth. The areas around and under the gums are difficult to reach via typical oral health care mechanisms that are mechanical in nature and, as such, the diseased states of gingi-vitis or periodontitis occur. The same bacterial listed above in connection with gingivitis can be involved in periodontitis, but an enormous variety of other bacteria can be found in these biofilms. Peri-implantitis, which is similar to periodontitis but occurs on the surface of dental implants, refers to the destruction of the supporting peri-implant tissue due to a microbial infection. These infections tend to occur around residual teeth or failing implants, which can act as reservoirs for bacteria and form biofilm colonies, as they have no inherent host response to fight the infecting organisms. The bacterial species involved in peri-implantitis are similar to those involved in periodontitis. The primary treatment for dental diseases is prevention. For the consumer, this involves tasks such as tooth brushing (mechanical debridement), usually with a fluoride-containing toothpaste; oral rinsing with a mouthwash containing cetylpyridinium chloride, stannous fluoride, or a combination of eucalyptol, menthol, methyl salicylate and thymol in an alcohol vehicle; and flossing. (Mouthwashes and rinses are not particularly effective at removing plaque, which necessitates continued use of floss in the inter-dental regions, as plaque tends to accumulate in these areas which brushing does not clean.) Regardless, because these preventive treatments are not effective at removing and disinfecting a biofilm, regular prophy-lactic treatment (removal of biofilm from the teeth, typically by mechanical scraping, although lasers have been used additionally or alternatively) by a dental professional usually is necessary. When dental disease has progressed to periodontitis, mechanical scraping (debridement) has been the only way to remove a biofilm. Professional treatment by a dental professional is performed by scaling (scraping of tartar from above and below the gum line) and root planning (removal of rough spots on the tooth root where the biofilm gathers), sometimes in combination with a laser. In more serious cases, to remove more tartar, flap surgery may be performed, where the gums are lifted so that tartar can be removed, followed by suturing. Bone and tissue grafts may also be performed in the area of bone loss. Medications are sometimes used in conjunction with mechanical treatments. These include prescription antimicrobial mouth rinses containing chlorhexidine; gum pocket inserts such as an antiseptic chip containing chlorhexidine, an antibiotic gel containing doxycycline, antibiotic microspheres containing minocycline, etc.; tablets containing doxycycline; or even systemic antibiotics. The aforedescribed antimicrobial compositions, both acidic and caustic, can be incorporated into any of a variety of oral care vehicles such as, but not limited to oral rinses and washes intended for preventive use, oral rinses intended to treat existing dental and gum disease, oral rinse treatment after dental implants, dental implant sterilization solutions (pre-surgical), disinfecting solutions for orthodontic devices (e.g., braces, retainers, etc.), irrigation solutions (both for use in surgical procedures, such as root canals and impacted teeth prior to closure, as well as in general and localized dental procedures), and the like. The vehicle can be a liquid, gel (e.g., a sealing or packing gel used during and/or after oral surgery), paste (e.g., toothpaste), or salve (e.g., topical treatment for mouth and lip conditions such as canker sores) and can be used with components such as fluoride ions and antibiotics, if desired. Where a liquid antimicrobial composition is to be introduced directly into an oral cavity (e.g., a mouthwash or rinse), some preference can be given to caustic compositions. Because most mouths naturally are a somewhat acidic environment, dental plaque, tartar and other forms of EPS/ECPS seem to be more impervious or resistant to chelation by acids than many other types of biofilm EPS/ECPS. Exemplary pH ranges for caustic compositions used here range from ˜7.5 to ˜10, commonly from ˜7.7 to ˜9.8, more commonly from ˜7.8 to ˜9.7, and typically ˜9±0.5 pH units. This basicity preferably is achieved with a strong inorganic base such as KOH or NaOH. With respect to tonicity, preferred ranges center around ˜1.75 Osm/L, commonly from ˜1.25 to ˜2.5 Osm/L, more commonly from ˜1.33 to ˜2.25 Osm/L, and typically from ˜1.5 to ˜2 Osm/L. To reach this type of tonicity without the pH going outside the previously noted ranges, one or more ionic compounds can be included in the composition. Exemplary materials include, but are not limited to, NaHSO4, NaH2PO4, NaCl, KCl, KI and the like. Non-ionic and cationic surfactants are preferred for the same reasons set forth above in connection with wound care. Both benzalkonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride are known to be safe for oral applications. Exemplary surfactant loading levels range from ˜0.5 to ˜1.8 g/L, commonly from ˜0.6 to ˜1.7 g/L, and typically from ˜0.75 to ˜1.5 g/L. The following table provides the composition and properties of a non-limiting example of a liquid antimicrobial composition intended for oral care applications.

 The antimicrobial compositions also can be incorporated into solid forms, such as chewing gums, lozenges, denture cleaning tablets, breath mints, removable or dissolving strips, powders and the like. They also can be used as, or incorporated in, liquids intended for aerosolizing or other spray techniques, such as breath sprays and dog teeth cleaning solutions. For additional information on the type and amounts that can be employed exemplary liquid and solid formulations, as well as methods of making, the interested reader is directed to any of a variety of references including, for example, U.S. Pat. Publ. Nos. 2005/0169852, 2006/0210491, 2007/0166242, 2008/0286213, 2009/0252690, and 2010/0330000. Those treatments intended for preventive applications typically will be form-ulated around lower toxicity thresholds than those intended for use by dental professionals. Adjuvants that can be included in such treating compositions include, but are not limited to, bleaching agents, binders, flavorings (e.g., essential oils and artificial sweeteners), humectants, foaming agents, abrasives, desensitizers, tooth whiteners, and analgesics. Treatment of adenoids and tonsils, although not strictly oral care, also is possible. Acute infections of the tonsils and adenoids generally are treated with systemic antibiotics. If tonsillitis is caused by group A streptococcus, penicillin or amoxicillin are commonly used with some success, while cephalosporins and macrolides being used less fre-quently. If these fail against β lactamase-producing bacteria (which reside in tonsil tissues and can shield group A streptococcus from penicillin-type antibiotics), clindamycin or amoxicillin-clavulanate may be used. Group A β-hemolytic streptococcus (GABHS) is the most common reason for chronic tonsil infections. Systemic antibiotics fail to treat GABHS due to a number of factors, including the presence of β lactamase-producing organisms that protect GABHS from peni-cillins, coaggregation with M. catarrhalis, absence of competing bacterial flora, poor penetration of antibiotics into tonsil cells, etc. Additionally, GABHS is known to form biofilms. This bacteria, as well as other pathogenic strains, can form biofilms on and within the tonsils and/or adenoids. Infectious bacteria in biofilm form are relatively impervious to systemic antibiotics, meaning that such high levels of antibiotics are necessary to treat them (i.e., orders of magnitude more than is necessary to kill planktonic bacteria) that the patient is unlikely to survive. Biofilm infections often become chronic. When the condition becomes chronic, surgical methods are employed to remove the tonsils and adenoids. The current treatment for chronic infections of the tonsils and adenoids is surgical removal through a tonsillectomy and adenoidectomy. This can be done by powered ablation which essentially burns away the tonsils and/or adenoids, a technique that minimizes or prevents bleeding of the tonsil bed post-surgery, or by cold steel instruments or mechanical debridement, in which case localized cauterization is performed on bleeding vessels to prevent re-bleeding after surgery. Tonsillectomy, with or without adenoidectomy, is one of the most common surgical procedures in the developed world. These surgical interventions are not without risk, however, with post-operative bleeding, airway obstruction, and adverse reaction to anesthesia being three of the most common problems. A substantial amount of pain and hospital recovery times also can be associated with these procedures. Bleeding can occur when scabs begin sloughing off from the surgical sites, generally 7 to 11 days after surgery. This occurs at a rate of about 1% to 2%, with both risk and severity being higher in adults than in children. A topical treatment for these infections is not available, as no commercially available product can disinfect and remove the biofilm and EPS from the tonsil/adenoid surface, nor can these products penetrate into the tonsil and adenoid surface to treat bacteria within the tissue. Of the oral mouth rinses on the market, which have active ingredients that include chlorhexidine, cetylpyridinium chloride, SnF2 and mixtures of therapeutic oils, none can disinfect a biofilm in the short treatment times available in the oral cavity. Antimicrobial compositions of the type described above, however, can be effective in treating infected adenoids and tonsils. A treatment regimen might be to gargle or rinse with up to 100 mL from 1 to 4 times each day, with the treatment running for as long as necessary, generally from 5-70 days, commonly from 7-65 days, more commonly from 8-60 days, and typically from 10-50 days, with 30±10 days being envisioned as most typical. In addition, direct application of an antimicrobial solid material directly to the affected area(s) also is envisioned. Advantages of this type of treatment include, but are not limited to, elimination of post-operative bleeding, avoidance of anesthesia, elimination of post-operative pain, preservation of anatomy, elimination of the risks of morbidity/mortality due to surgery and post-surgical complications, and overall lower healthcare costs. Medical Equipment Prior to disinfection or sterilization, all reusable medical devices must be cleaned thoroughly, a step that requires that all surfaces, internal and external, be made completely free of so-called bioburden, i.e., residual body tissue and fluids, bacteria, fungi, viruses, proteins, and carbohydrates. After the manual and/or mechanical cleaning, the devices must be thoroughly rinsed to remove all residual bioburden and detergent. With current technology, if the device is not clean, sterilization cannot be achieved. Current chemical treatments are ineffective at treating biofilms because of their inherent resistance to biocides. Biofilms can be removed by physical methods such as ultra-sound and mechanical cleaning reasonably effectively, but ensuring that it occurs correctly and completely each time is very difficult. Endoscopes are particularly susceptible to biofilm formation due to their use within the body. Removal of biofilm from the internal surfaces of small diameter tubing within endoscopes is difficult due to limited access and the degradation of these surfaces. Biofilm formation within endoscope channels can result in failure of disinfection procedures and can create a vicious cycle of growth, disinfection, partial killing or inhibition and regrowth, and patients who undergo endoscopy with a biofilm-containing endoscope are at risk for an endoscopy related infection. Bacteria in a biofilm have been shown to be capable of surviving in a down-regulated state after being cleaned and disinfected by present methods. The cleaning and disinfecting processes used are dependent upon the training and diligence of the operator and, while guidelines for endoscope disinfection have been developed by many organizations, no method to determine the efficacy of these regimes on a routine basis is currently available. Failure to completely clean and dry an endoscope using the current guidelines can lead to biofilm formation, with studies suggesting that human error is a major contributing factor, along with the need for rapid turnover of equipment and inadequate training. Similar problems are inherent in the cleaning and disinfection processes used with other medical devices and equipment, although endoscopes seem to be linked to more outbreaks of HAIs, a problem discussed in more detail below. Also problematic are devices and equipment that are not necessarily designed for invasive insertion. This includes manual instruments, powered surgical instruments, and even devices cages and guides for performing spinal surgery. These too are cleaned and disinfected post-usage, with the procedure generally involving wiping followed by sterilization (normally by steam, but occasionally by peroxide or other high performance procedures). Some devices are returned to their manufacturer for reprocessing, often with steam sterilization both before and after reprocessing. The formulation of reprocessing cleaning solutions are unique; however, most contain some combination of at least six components: water, detergent, surfactant, buffer, and chelating agents. Enzymes are also used to increase cleaning efficacy, speed the cleaning process and help to minimize the need for manual brushing and scrubbing. A variety of enzymes, each targeting a particular type of soil, are employed, with the most common being protease (which helps to break down protein-based soils such as blood and feces), amylase (which breaks down starches like those found in muscle tissue), cellulase (which breaks down carbohydrates like those found in connective fluid and joint tissue), and lipase (which breaks down fats like those found in adipose tissue). Any combination of these enzymes may be present in a solution. Solutions containing enzymes can often be used at a more neutral pH and at lower temperatures than those without enzymes. Enzymatic cleaning agents are used as the first step in medical device disinfection to remove biofilms. However, physical cleaning with an enzymatic cleaning agent does not disinfect the device. Even a few viable organisms that might remain after cleaning can accumulate into a biofilm over time. It has been found that commonly used enzymatic cleaners fail to reduce the viable bacterial load or remove the bacterial EPS. Cleaners with high enzyme activity remove some biofilm but fail to reduce bacterial numbers more than 2 logs (i.e., 99%), and some enzymatic solutions actually can contribute to the formation of biofilms. Accordingly, proper disinfection is required to kill down-regulated microbes and prevents the formation of biofilm. All devices undergo a disinfection process and users perform a chemical disinfection process following cleaning. Either an oxidative or aldehyde-based chemistry is used. However, some disinfection chemistries have demonstrated a tendency to promote the formation of biofilms and none completely remove a biofilm that has already formed. Gluteraldehyde solution buildup over several uses actually has been found to promote formation of biofilms within the lumens of endoscopes. Disinfectants employing oxidative chemistries are more effective at controlling the formation of biofilms. However, it has been found that even the harsh environment created by some disinfectants can be survived by these well-protected microbes, which can survive by using several food sources not typically thought to be possible. These disinfectants are also susceptible to deactivation by proteins that may be present on the endoscopes and medical devices, especially if the cleaning step is not adequately performed. Cleaning chemicals require unimpeded contact with all surfaces of the device, internal and external, to assure microbial inactivation; any residuals left on the device, including medical soil, contaminants and detergent residue can interfere with that direct contact. Further, even if they have access to a biofilm, they cannot kill bacteria entrained therein. The shape and design of some devices and instruments make it impossible to remove all of the proteins and EPS/ECPS which may be on them. Presently available cleaners or disinfection techniques are unable to completely remove EPS/ECPS, especially if there is protein which can prevent cleaning chemicals from reaching these areas. Remaining EPS/ECPS can allow for rapid biofilm reformation on the device, and the EPS/ECPS can be dislodged into the surgical field, including into the patient, allowing for a nidus of infection. Advantageously, antimicrobial compositions of the type described above can be effective in cleaning, disinfecting and sterilizing reusable medical equipment. In these techniques, both toxicity and efficacy can be pushed to extremely high levels. Depending on the nature of the materials from which the equipment is made, either acidic or basic compositions can be preferred. For example, a caustic composition might be preferred for a metallic piece of equipment, while an acidic composition might be preferred for a plastic piece. Extremely acidic or caustic compositions preferably are avoided, i.e., the composition employed commonly has a pH within 4 units, preferably within 3 units, and more preferably within 2 units of neutral. Where an acidic composition is employed, a conjugate base of the acid preferably also is present. Tonicities of solutions employed here generally are at least ˜2.0 Osm/L, commonly at least ˜2.5 Osm/L, more commonly at least ˜3.0 Osm/L, and typically at least ˜3.5 Osm/L. In both acidic and caustic compositions, additional solute(s) can be present. In compositions with moderate pH (i.e., 5≤pH≤9, particularly 6≤pH≤8), large amounts of such solutes can be used; for example, for a composition of 6.5≤pH≤7.5, the amount of accompanying salt or solute can be as high as 200 g/L, 250 g/L, 300 g/L, 350 g/L, 400 g/L, 450 g/L or even 500 g/L. Regardless of the nature of the material, cationic surfactants are strongly preferred, with particular preference being given to tetradecyltrimethylammonium halides. Surfactant loading can be pushed to very high levels, e.g., 10 g/L, 15 g/L, 20 g/L, or even 30 g/L or more can be used. Advantageously, the equipment need stay in the composition for no more than a few hours. For example, in no case should static dwell time be required to exceed 250 minutes, with less than 200 minutes being common, less than 150 minutes being more common, less than 100 minutes being even more common, and less than 50 minutes being typical. Depending on the particular antimicrobial composition employed, the dwell time can range from 1 to ˜30 minutes, from ˜2 to ˜25 minutes, from ˜3 to ˜20 minutes, or from ˜5 to ˜15 minutes. The amount of dwell time can be decreased even more with flow for treatment and/or mechanical scrubbing to remove the EPS. Higher-than-ambient temperatures and pressures also can increase efficacy, which can be particularly useful equipment having high loadings of bioburden and/or difficult geometry (e.g., scopes). As an example of the extreme efficacy of the liquid antimicrobial compositions described herein in this application, a citric acid/sodium citrate dihydrate composition having a pH of ˜6.5 and a tonicity of ˜3.5 Osm/L and including ˜15 g/L tetradecyltrimethylammonium chloride surfactant was able to achieve a 9 log reduction (i.e., 99.9999999%) in Pseudomonas in small diameter silicone and polyethylene tubing as well as on metal and plastic coupons. HAI Basic routes of infection involve transmission via contact (direct and indirect), droplets, airborne, common vehicle (contaminated items such as food, water, medications, devices, and equipment), and vector (from mosquitoes, flies, rodents, etc.), with direct contact being the most frequent mode. In direct contact, a colonized person (e.g., a caregiver or another patient) transfers the microorganism from his body to that of a susceptible patient. Indirect transmission involves contact between the host, usually a caregiver, and a contaminated object which then becomes the vector for infecting the susceptible patient; examples of objects that can become contaminated include instruments and equipment such as needles, dressings, disposable gloves, saline flush syringes, vials, bags, blood pressure cuffs, stethoscopes, and the like, as well as non-medical surfaces such as door handles, packaging, mops, linens, pens, keyboards, telephones, bed rails, call buttons, touch plates, seating surfaces, light switches, grab rails, intravenous poles, dispensers, dressing trolleys, countertops, tabletops, and the like. Droplet transmission occurs when droplets containing microbes from an infected person are propelled a short distance through the air and deposited on the patient's body. Droplets may be produced from the source person by coughing, sneezing, talking, and during the performance of certain procedures such as bronchoscopy. Airborne transmission can be by either airborne droplet nuclei of evaporated droplets containing microorganisms that remain suspended in the air for long periods of time or dust particles containing the infectious agent. Microorganisms carried in this manner can be dispersed widely by air currents and may become inhaled by a susceptible host in the same room as or quite remote from the original source. Microorganisms commonly transmitted in this manner include Legionella, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and the rubeola and varicella viruses. Of particular and growing interest and concern are MRSA and VRE. Contamination of the environment with MRSA or VRE occurs when infected or colonized individuals are present in hospital rooms, often medical personnel carrying the organism in or on their clothing. MRSA contamination of gloves also has been observed in many personnel who had no direct contact with the patient but who had touched surfaces in infected patient's rooms. The hands, gloved or otherwise, of healthcare workers can become contaminated by touching surfaces in the vicinity of an infected patient. In undried form, MRSA can survive for up to 48 hours on a plastic surface; in dried form, it can survive for several weeks. It is stable at a wide range of temperatures and humidities, and can survive exposure to sunlight and desiccation. Once a surface becomes contaminated, pathogens can be transferred to other surfaces and patients in the vicinity. Hand washing and gloves can help prevent the spread of HAIs via hand-surface transmission but cannot eradicate surface or indwelling contamination, nor do they eliminate the potential for direct transfer by the patient. However, these methods do nothing to treat the presence of these pathogenic bacteria on surfaces and indwelling devices. Touch surfaces commonly found in hospital rooms often are contaminated with MRSA and VRE, with objects in closest proximity to patients having the highest levels of contamination. The efficacy of traditional cleaning products (e.g., alcohols, quaternary ammonia compounds, and bleach) to remove surface contamination is limited. One recent study of contamination in the hospital environment detected MRSA on 74% of swab samples prior to cleaning and on 66% of swab samples after cleaning, indicating that current methods for disinfecting hospital surfaces are ineffective. Some modern sanitizing methods are more effective against select pathogens; for example, non-flammable alcohol vapor in CO2 has been demonstrated to be effective against gastroenteritis, MRSA, and influenza, while H2O2, as a liquid or vapor, has been shown to reduce infection rates and risk of acquisition, particularly in connection with endospore-forming bacteria such as Clostridium difficile. However, these are so-called “contained” methods (i.e., done in a closed, controlled environment) and cannot be performed unless the object can be removed and taken to a separate treatment facility, and, even then, none have proven to be effective against biofilms and, even in those instances when sanitization is achieved, the biofilm EPS is not removed by any of these treatments (thereby permitting much more rapid re-growth of the bacterial biofilm as compared to an EPS-free surface when a pathogen is re-introduced). From the foregoing, the ordinarily skilled artisan can envision many potential applications for the antimicrobial compositions described previously in the battle against HAIs, as well as biofilms containing or capable of entraining HAI-causing microorganisms. Common examples include cleaning and/or disinfection of any of the types of hard surfaces mentioned above, as well as floors and walls; water transport articles including sinks, therapeutic tubs, showers and drains; beds; transport devices such as gurneys and wheelchairs; surgical suites; and the like. In these instances, high efficacy and low toxicity generally are preferred. Particularly preferred are those compositions which will not harm (e.g., warp or discolor) the surface being treated. Other common examples include cleaning and/or disinfection of any of the types of medical equipment mentioned above, particularly those which are intended for insertion into a patient (e.g., respiratory tubes, IV lines, and catheters) or application to the skin (e.g., stethoscopes, blood pressure cuffs, and the like). Again, high efficacy and low toxicity generally are preferred for this type of application. Other examples include laundering compositions for linens and clothing, hand disinfectants and washes, surgical site preparation solutions, and the like. Laundering compositions are envisioned as typically being caustic and including high loading levels of surfactant, as well as being capable of being provided in either liquid or solid form for addition to wash water. Hand washes and surgical preparation compositions would be very similar to the OTC and Rx wound washes described previously. No particular limitation on the types of microbes that can be treated are envisioned, with particularly problematic pathogenic organisms like Clostridium difficile, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Candida albicans, MRSA, and VRE being specifically envisioned. Also envisioned is any microbe that forms or can reside in a biofilm, with treatment involving both destruction/removal of the biofilm as well as killing of the microbes entrained therein. Implants Although terminally sterilized, medical device implants can become colonized, prior to and during implantation, with bacteria from the environment, from a healthcare worker, or more commonly from bacteria present on the patient's own skin. After insertion, implants can become colonized from systemic bacteria which make their way to the implant which provides a surface for biofilm growth because the implant surface is not protected by the host immune defenses. In addition, currently employed sterilization techniques are not designed to remove EPS/ECPS. Therefore, even a sterilized device/article that is properly implanted can have EPS/ECPS on its surface from previous exposure. The presence of EPS/ECPS greatly facilitates formation of a biofilm. Soon after a device or article is implanted, a conditioning layer composed of host-derived adhesins (including fibrinogen, fibronectin, and collagen) forms on the surface of the implant and invites adherence of free-floating (planktonic) organisms. Bacterial cell division, recruitment of additional planktonic organisms, and secretion of bacterial products (such as the glycocalyx) follow, resulting in a three-dimensional structure of biofilm that contains complex communities of tightly attached (sessile) bacteria. These bacteria display cell-to-cell signaling and exist within a polymer matrix containing fluid channels that allow for the flow of nutrients and waste. Once a biofilm forms on an implant, no currently available treatment can eradicate it. Systemic antibiotics are ineffective against such infections, certainly due to the inherent protection by the EPS/ECPS but also perhaps due to limited blood supply at the surface of the implanted article. Most implants infected by S. aureus or candida require surgical removal. Infections with less virulent coagulase-negative staphylococci may not require surgery to remove the implant. If a decision is made to remove the infected implant, complete extraction of all components is performed, regardless of the type of infecting organism. An infected joint prosthesis can be retained after debridement or, more commonly, removed. In removal situations, the affected area is treated with large doses of antibiotics, optionally followed by insertion of a new device either immediately or, more commonly, after a 35-45 day course of a systemic antibiotic. Infections (and treatments) associated with orthopedic devices often result in serious disabilities. Infections associated with surgical implants are particularly difficult to manage because they require longer periods of antibiotic therapy and repeated surgical procedures. Mortality attributable to such infections is highest among patients with cardiovascular implants, particularly prosthetic heart valves and aortic grafts. A biofilm-fouled pacemaker-defibrillator implant often is treated by a combined medical and surgical treatment. Surgical treatment is done in two-stages: the entire implanted system, including the cardiac leads, is completely removed, even in patients with clinical infection of only the pocket, because their cardiac leads may already be colonized (with cardiac rhythm being controlled by a temporary mechanism), a lengthy course of systemic antibiotics is administered (up to two weeks for infections of the pulse-generator pocket or 35-45 days for lead-associated endocarditis), and a replacement device/article is implanted on the contralateral side of the patient. Infections of fracture-fixation devices that involve bone are treated with a 6-week course of systemic antibiotics, whereas 10 to 14 days of antibiotic therapy are sufficient for superficial infections. Infection of intramedullary nails is often associated with nonunion of bone and requires removal of the infected nail, insertion of external-fixation pins, and if necessary, subsequent insertion of a replacement nail. Surgical treatment of infection of external-fixation pins usually consists of a single procedure to remove the infected pins and, if bone union has not occurred, either insert new pins at a distant site or fuse the bones. Treatment of infected mammary implants usually entails a two-stage replacement procedure: removal of the infected implant and debridement of the capsule surrounding it. After administration of a course of systemic antibiotics and time for the area to heal somewhat, the contralateral implant is removed, and a replacement pair of mammary implants is inserted. An infected penile implant typically is removed, and a malleable penile prosthesis is inserted to preserve space. After the necessary systemic antibiotic treatment, a new inflatable implant is inserted in place of the malleable prosthesis. Even cutaneous implants such as tracheotomy tubes, ostomy bags, catheters, and piercings can become fouled with biofilms that are difficult to remove, a problem exacerbated by the non-removal nature of certain types of these articles. The aforedescribed antimicrobial compositions can be effective topical treatments, applied to a to-be-implanted device or article or can be used to wash the infected implant and surrounding tissue to rid the body of a biofilm and/or biofilm-forming materials such as EPS/ECPS. The types of surfaces involved can be or include PTFE, PVC, silicone gels and rubbers, polyethylene, polypropylene, poly(meth)acrylates, stainless steel, precious metals (e.g., gold, silver, and platinum), ceramics, and titanium. The pocket where the implant is or was located likewise can be treated with a liquid composition of the types mentioned above in connection with wound care. This can be done at the time of the original implantation (i.e., immediately following insertion of the article and prior to suturing), and can be followed with rinsing/irrigation, suctioning or both. For implants in contact with body tissue, low toxicity but moderate-to-high efficacy is desired; this might be achievable with a composition having a fairly neutral pH (e.g., 5≤pH≤9) but moderate-to-high osmolarity, e.g., at least ˜1.5 Osm/L, commonly at least ˜1.75 Osm/L, more commonly at least ˜2.0 Osm/L, and typically at least ˜2.25 Osm/L. Compositions with tonicities of ˜2.5, ˜2.75, ˜3.0, ˜3.25, ˜3.5, ˜3.75 or even ˜4 Osm/L can be used. Cationic surfactants again are preferred, preferably at levels of ˜0.5 to ˜2 g/L, more preferably of ˜0.7 to ˜1.8 g/L, and most preferably of ˜0.8 to ˜1.5 g/L. For devices not yet in contact with body tissue, the conditions can be more extreme, i.e., higher toxicity and very high osmolarity. In either case, the application of the antimicrobial composition can be by rinsing, wiping, flushing, etc., optionally in conjunction with scraping/debridement and optionally followed by a rinsing step. In extreme cases, the implanted article can be removed and treated ex vivo with the composition prior to reimplantation. Alternative or additional techniques involve preparing a body area in which an implant is to be inserted by washing, wiping and/or irrigating that area with an antimicrobial composition. This can be done in conjunction with surgical preparation sterilization with the same or similar composition. While various embodiments of the present invention have been provided, they are presented by way of example and not limitation. To the extent feasible, as long as they are not interfering or incompatible, features and embodiments described above in isolation can be combined with other features and embodiments.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Oncolytic viruses have been tested as agents for the treatment of cancers by infecting and destroying tumor cells. These oncolytic viruses include Newcastle Disease Virus, Adenovirus, Sindbis virus, Vaccinia virus, Herpes virus etc. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) showed a great potential in shrinking tumor in cancer patients due to its unique property of preferential replication in and lysis of tumor cells, presumably owing to the factor that most tumor cells have a deficient interferon pathway (Pecora et al., 2002; Laurie et al., 2006; Lorence et al., 2007). Despite the preliminary promising clinical results, NDV as a cancer therapeutic agent has a shortcoming: inevitably most of the NDV particles will be destroyed by the patient's innate immune system, the alternative complement pathway, once the viruses enter the patient's body. The complement system is a part of the innate and adaptive immune system (reviewed by Volanakis, J. E., 1998. Chapter 2. In The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Edited by J. E. Volanakis, and M. M. Frank. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York pp 9-32). Complement plays an important role in microbial killing, and for the transport and clearance of immune complexes. Many of the activation products of the complement system are also associated with proinflammatory or immunoregulatory functions. The complement system consists of plasma and membrane-associated proteins that are organized in three enzymatic-activation cascades: the classical, the lectin, and the alternative pathways. All three pathways can lead to the formation of the terminal complement complex/membrane attack complex (TCC/MAC) and an array of biologically active products. Human cells and organs have a family of membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins to protect them from homologous complement-mediated lysis. These complement regulatory proteins include CD55 (decay-accelerating factor, DAF), CD46 (membrane cofactor protein, MCP), CD35 (complement receptor 1, CR1), and CD59 (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) (Carroll et al., 1988; Rey-Campos et al., 1988; Lublin et al., 1989; Morgan et al., 1994; Kim and Song, 2006). CD55 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein and attaches to a cell plasma membrane through a glycolipid moiety (GPI anchor) at its C-terminus. The GPI-anchored proteins such as CD55 can be endocytosed and degraded or cleaved and released from cell plasma membrane (Censullo and Davitz, 1994a, 1994b; Turner 1994). For example, The GPI-anchored proteins including CD55 can be released from the cell surface by the action of GPI-specific phospholipases C and D (Turner 1994). These enzymatic activities likely control the catabolism of GPI-anchored proteins and regulate the cell surface expression of these proteins (Censullo and Davitz, 1994b). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION This invention provides a recombinant fusion protein comprising: (a) a CD55 peptide sequence, (b) a linker sequence C-terminal to the CD55 sequence, (c) a transmembrane domain C-terminal to the linker sequence, and (d) an intracellular domain C-terminal to the transmembrane domain, wherein the fusion protein does not contain a GPI anchor. This invention also provides nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding the protein, cells expressing the protein, enveloped viruses incorporating the protein on the viral membrane, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the protein-incorporating virus of this invention, as well as methods of treatment and uses of the virus. This invention is based, in part, on the finding that virus expressing a fusion protein according to this invention was resistant to inactivation by normal human serum, as evidenced by a higher recovery rate compared to virus not expressing the fusion protein. The oncolytic enveloped virus produced by the engineered cells of the invention which incorporate complement inhibitor in the form of a recombinant fusion protein on the viral membrane is a better cancer therapeutic and affords better clinical outcomes for cancer patients as compared to the corresponding virus lacking a complement inhibitor on the viral membrane, due to its survival capability in the human serum circulation before it gets into a tumor. The benefits are three-fold: 1) the oncolytic virus can be produced in a cell culturing system in a bio-reactor; 2) fewer viral particles are needed to achieve the same therapeutic efficacy as compared to the parental oncolytic virus produced in chicken eggs; 3) infusion of fewer viral particles to a cancer patient may reduce side effects associated with large amounts of viral particles such as cytokine storm or impurity related effects. Others who have studied the effects of the complement regulatory protein CD55 on the protection of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) (Biswas et al., 2012; Rangaswamy et al., 2016) used native unmodified CD55, which includes a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor. In contrast the fusion protein of this invention omits the GPI anchor. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the omission of a GPI anchor changed the catabolism dynamics of CD55 on the cell surface. The fusion protein of this invention was able to withstand inactivation conditions more stringent than those utilized by Biswas and Rangaswamy. Biswas used 5 to 10% normal human serum and Rangaswamy used 0.3 to 5% normal human serum in their inactivation assays. The example below used 40% normal human serum to conduct the inactivation assay on NDV that has incorporated the recombinant fusion protein.

In accordance with the fusion protein of this invention there can optionally be a spacer of one or more amino acids between the N-terminal signal peptide and sequence (a), between sequence (a) and sequence (b), between sequence (b) and sequence (c), between sequence (c) and sequence (d), between any two of them, between any three of them, or between all four. In one embodiment of this invention there is no spacer between the N-terminal signal peptide and sequence (a), or in other words the N-terminal signal peptide is covalently bonded to sequence (a) by a single peptide bond. In another embodiment there is a spacer between the N-terminal signal peptide and sequence (a). In one embodiment of this invention there is no spacer between sequence (a) and sequence (b), or in other words sequence (a) is covalently bonded to sequence (b) by a single peptide bond.

In one embodiment of this invention there is no spacer between sequence (c) and sequence (d), or in other words sequence (c) is covalently bonded to sequence (d) by a single peptide bond. In another embodiment there is a spacer between sequence (c) and sequence (d). There is in principle no limitation on the size of the spacers. CD55 contains four extracellular short consensus repeat (SCR), a Ser/Thr/Pro (STP)-rich region and a GPI-anchored domain. In accordance with the fusion protein of this invention the GPI-anchor domain is omitted. The STP-rich region can be present or absent. One embodiment of the fusion protein coding sequence of this invention further comprises a polyadenylation signal C-terminal to the third peptide sequence coding sequence. The polyadenylation signal (Poly A) can be any Poly A. This invention provides a nucleic acid encoding the protein described above. In one embodiment the nucleic acid is DNA. It can optionally contain one or more introns, either between the sequences coding for the signal peptide and sequence (a), between sequence (a) and sequence (b), between sequence (b) and sequence (c), between sequence (c) and sequence (d), or elsewhere. In an embodiment of this invention the nucleic acid encodes a protein having the sequence SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:3. SEQ ID NO:1 is one example of a nucleic acid encoding a protein having the sequence SEQ ID NO:2. Because different nucleic acid codon triplets code for the same amino acid, a relationship known as the degeneracy of the genetic code, many other nucleic acid sequences that encode a protein having the sequence SEQ ID NO:2 can readily be envisioned and are included in this invention. An embodiment of this invention is an expression vector comprising the nucleic acid described above operatively linked to a control sequence, for example a promoter. The promoter driving the fusion protein can be any promoter and is not limited to a CMV promoter. When there is an intron between the promoter and the fusion protein coding sequence, any suitable and conventional intron can be utilized. For example, a (3-globin intron is suitable. This invention provides a cell line stably expressing the fusion protein of this invention on its cell surface. Any conventional cell line for protein expression can be used in accordance with this invention. In one embodiment the cell line is a mammalian cell line. In another embodiment the cell line is a non-mammalian cell line, for example a DF-1 chicken embryonic fibroblast cell line. This invention provides an enveloped virus incorporating the fusion protein described above on the virus membrane. In accordance with this invention any enveloped virus can be utilized. In an embodiment the virus is an oncolytic virus, for example a paramyxovirus such as Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV). In the examples a complement inhibitor in the form of a recombinant fusion protein was incorporated onto NDV particles envelope. The recombinant fusion protein of this invention could be used for oncolytic viruses other than NDV, leading to generation of oncolytic viral particles that are more resistant to host complement inactivation. The novel recombinant complement inhibitor in the form of a fusion protein can be used to modify any other mammalian cells such as HeLa cells to produce oncolytic viruses. Oncolytic viruses are described in International Patent Publication No. WO 2000/062735, the content of which is incorporated by reference. In the experiments whose results are presented below the NDV utilized was PPMK107 described in WO 2000/062735. The virus can be incorporated in a pharmaceutical composition that comprises the virus and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This invention provides a method for treating a neoplastic condition in a mammalian subject, comprising administering to the subject an amount of the virus described above effective to treat the neoplastic condition. For cancer treatment the virus can be administrated to the patients via any conventional route, for example by one or more intratumoral or intravenous injections. For intratumoral administration, the dose range can be from 1×107 to 5×1012 pfu/per tumor. For intravenous administration, the dose range can be from 1×107 to 1×1013 pfu/m2. (‘Pfu’ is an abbreviation for ‘plaque forming unit’.) The oncolytic virus according to this invention could also be engineered to incorporate other molecules such as GMCSF to enhance the efficacy of the oncolytic virus. In addition, the oncolytic virus could be a part of a combination cancer therapy with a checkpoint inhibitor such as anti-PD1 or anti-PDL1 molecule.

All publications, patents and patent applications mentioned in this specification are herein incorporated by reference in their entirety into the specification to the same extent as if each individual publication, patent or patent application was specifically and individually indicated to be incorporated herein by reference. Also incorporated by reference is any supplemental information that was published along with any of the aforementioned publications, patents and patent applications. For example, some journal articles are published with supplemental information that is typically available online. The invention will be better understood by reference to the following examples, which illustrate but do not limit the invention described herein. EXAMPLES Example 1 A modified version of recombinant CD55 with a four short consensus repeat (SCR) of CD55 downstream of the secretory signal peptide followed by a flexible linker (3×G4S1) and a CD8 transmembrane and a truncated CD8 intracellular domain was created (FIG. 1). The coding sequence was cloned into a mammalian expression construct that has a CMV promoter, a synthetic intron driving the recombinant protein expression. The expression cassette also contained a drug selectable marker, neomycin phosphotransferase downstream from IRES. The gene expression cassette ended with a synthetic polyadenylation signal. SEQ ID NO:1 is the nucleotide sequence of the mammalian cell expression construct. SEQ ID NO:2 represents the amino acid sequence of the expressed protein. When expressed on chicken embryonic fibroblast DF1 cell surface or incorporated onto virus membrane, the signal peptide is cleaved yielding the mature recombinant fusion protein (SEQ ID NO:3) which has a configuration/orientation such that the CD55 SCR is on the outside of the cell or viral membrane, the flexible linker adjacent to the cell or viral membrane should provide maximal flexibility for the SCR of CD55 to exercise its biological function, i.e., disabling C3 convertase which is the central regulator of complement pathway. The flexible linker is followed by a CD8 transmembrane domain and a truncated CD8 intracellular domain. Example 2 The mammalian expression construct was transfected into chicken embryonic fibroblast DF1 cells via PEI 25K (polyethylenimine, linear 25 kDa, Polysciences, Cat. No. 23966) mediated transfection. Seventy two hours post-transfection, the transfected cells were selected in 300 μg/mL G418 (Geneticin®, aminoglycoside antibiotic) to create a stable cell line that constitutively expresses SEQ ID NO:2. The stable cell line constitutively expressed SEQ ID NO:3 on its cell surface as detected by a monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Catalog No. MAB20091) that is specific for mature human CD55. As shown in FIG. 3, the recombinant fusion protein was expressed on the DF1 cells stably transfected with the construct that encodes the recombinant fusion protein as analyzed by flow cytometry (FIG. 3, the histogram on the right). The naïve DF1 cells served as a negative control (FIG. 3, the histogram on the left). Example 3 The stable cell line expressing SEQ ID NO:3 on the cell surface was infected with wild type NDV that was produced from embryonated chicken eggs. The virus was then titered on human tumor cell line HT1080. Equal amount of virus (measured by PFU) was subjected to incubation with 40% normal human serum (NHS) and 40% heat-inactivated normal human serum (iNHS) respectively. The virus that remained alive after incubation with human serum was then scored on HT1080 cells by plaque assay. The ratio of virus recovered after incubation with NHS vs iNHS was calculated. As shown in Table 1, the recovery rate for the virus produced in embryonated chicken eggs was 0.5%, suggesting vast majority of the NDV particles produced by chicken eggs were inactivated most likely by human alternative complement pathway. Likewise, the recovery rate for the virus produced by the parental chicken embryonic fibroblast DF1 cells was 0.5%. Surprisingly, the recovery rate for the virus produced from the bulk non-clonal DF1 cells that stably expressed SEQ ID NO:3 on the cell surface was 5.8%, greater than 10 fold more than the wild type virus. When a total of 11 clonal populations of DF1 cells expressing SEQ ID NO:3 were examined, the recovery rate ranged from 0.8 to 20% with five clones scoring a lower recovery rate and six clones scoring a higher recovery rate than the bulk non-clonal cell line (Table 1). The virus generated by clone number 8 had a recovery rate of 10% which was 20 fold higher than the virus either produced by embryonated chicken eggs or the parental DF1 cells. The virus generated by clone number 40 had a recovery rate of 20% which was 40 fold higher than the virus either produced by embryonated chicken eggs or the parental DF1 cells. These data strongly suggest that the complement activity presented in normal human serum rapidly destroyed the NDV particles that were produced by embryonated chicken eggs or the parental chicken embryonic fibroblast DF1 cells. However, the new NDV particles produced by DF-1 cells that stably expressed recombinant complement inhibitor on the cell surface showed a remarkable up to 40-fold higher recovery rate as compared to the virus either produced by chicken eggs or the parental DF1 cells after incubation with 40% normal human serum under identical experimental conditions.

 Example 4 The broad spectrum oncolytic activity of NDV that was produced from the DF1 cells stably expressing the complement inhibitory fusion protein on their cell surface (Clone Number 8) was assessed using CellTiter96® AQueous One Solution. This solution functions similar to MTT (i.e., 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays where metabolically active cells are able to bio-reduce MTS tetrazolium (i.e., 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) in the reagent into soluble chromogenic formazan. Briefly, three different tumor cell lines HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), PANC-1 (pancreatic epithelial carcinoma) and OV-CARS (ovarian adenocarcinoma) where grown in separate 96 well plates. The following day, serial dilutions of the NDV virus were added to respective wells and the plate was incubated for 6 days at 37° C. incubator with 5% CO2. On Day 6, the absorbance of all wells on each plate was measured at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer. IC50 was calculated using 4 parameter logistic nonlinear regression analysis for each cell line. This resulted in final IC50 values of 255, 120 and 47 pfu/well for HT1080, OV-CAR-3 and PANC-1 cell lines respectively (FIG. 4). These results indicate that the NDV particles produced by DF-1 cells that stably expressed recombinant complement inhibitor on its cell surface retain the ability to lyse various tumor cell lines in a dose dependent manner.

These oncolytic viruses include Newcastle Disease Virus, Adenovirus, Sindbis virus, Vaccinia virus, Herpes virus etc. Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) showed a great potential in shrinking tumor in cancer patients due to its unique property of preferential replication in and lysis of tumor cells, presumably owing to the factor that most tumor cells have a deficient interferon pathway (Pecora et al., 2002; Laurie et al., 2006; Lorence et al., 2007). Despite the preliminary promising clinical results, NDV as a cancer therapeutic agent has a shortcoming: inevitably most of the NDV particles will be destroyed by the patient's innate immune system, the alternative complement pathway, once the viruses enter the patient's body. The complement system is a part of the innate and adaptive immune system (reviewed by Volanakis, J. E., 1998. Chapter 2. In The Human Complement System in Health and Disease. Edited by J. E. Volanakis, and M. M. Frank. Marcel Dekker, Inc., New York pp 9-32). Complement plays an important role in microbial killing, and for the transport and clearance of immune complexes. Many of the activation products of the complement system are also associated with proinflammatory or immunoregulatory functions. The complement system consists of plasma and membrane-associated proteins that are organized in three enzymatic-activation cascades: the classical, the lectin, and the alternative pathways. All three pathways can lead to the formation of the terminal complement complex/membrane attack complex (TCC/MAC) and an array of biologically active products. Human cells and organs have a family of membrane-bound complement regulatory proteins to protect them from homologous complement-mediated lysis. These complement regulatory proteins include CD55 (decay-accelerating factor, DAF), CD46 (membrane cofactor protein, MCP), CD35 (complement receptor 1, CR1), and CD59 (membrane inhibitor of reactive lysis) (Carroll et al., 1988; Rey-Campos et al., 1988; Lublin et al., 1989; Morgan et al., 1994; Kim and Song, 2006). CD55 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-anchored protein and attaches to a cell plasma membrane through a glycolipid moiety (GPI anchor) at its C-terminus. The GPI-anchored proteins such as CD55 can be endocytosed and degraded or cleaved and released from cell plasma membrane (Censullo and Davitz, 1994a, 1994b; Turner 1994). For example, The GPI-anchored proteins including CD55 can be released from the cell surface by the action of GPI-specific phospholipases C and D (Turner 1994). These enzymatic activities likely control the catabolism of GPI-anchored proteins and regulate the cell surface expression of these proteins (Censullo and Davitz, 1994b). ",,"This invention provides a recombinant fusion protein comprising: (a) a CD55 peptide sequence, (b) a linker sequence C-terminal to the CD55 sequence, (c) a transmembrane domain C-terminal to the linker sequence, and (d) an intracellular domain C-terminal to the transmembrane domain, wherein the fusion protein does not contain a GPI anchor. This invention also provides nucleic acids and expression vectors encoding the protein, cells expressing the protein, enveloped viruses incorporating the protein on the viral membrane, pharmaceutical compositions comprising the protein-incorporating virus of this invention, as well as methods of treatment and uses of the virus. This invention is based, in part, on the finding that virus expressing a fusion protein according to this invention was resistant to inactivation by normal human serum, as evidenced by a higher recovery rate compared to virus not expressing the fusion protein. The oncolytic enveloped virus produced by the engineered cells of the invention which incorporate complement inhibitor in the form of a recombinant fusion protein on the viral membrane is a better cancer therapeutic and affords better clinical outcomes for cancer patients as compared to the corresponding virus lacking a complement inhibitor on the viral membrane, due to its survival capability in the human serum circulation before it gets into a tumor. The benefits are three-fold: 1) the oncolytic virus can be produced in a cell culturing system in a bio-reactor; 2) fewer viral particles are needed to achieve the same therapeutic efficacy as compared to the parental oncolytic virus produced in chicken eggs; 3) infusion of fewer viral particles to a cancer patient may reduce side effects associated with large amounts of viral particles such as cytokine storm or impurity related effects. Others who have studied the effects of the complement regulatory protein CD55 on the protection of Newcastle Disease Virus (NDV) (Biswas et al., 2012; Rangaswamy et al., 2016) used native unmodified CD55, which includes a glycosylphosphatidyl-inositol (GPI) anchor. In contrast the fusion protein of this invention omits the GPI anchor. Without wishing to be bound by theory it is believed that the omission of a GPI anchor changed the catabolism dynamics of CD55 on the cell surface. The fusion protein of this invention was able to withstand inactivation conditions more stringent than those utilized by Biswas and Rangaswamy. Biswas used 5 to 10% normal human serum and Rangaswamy used 0.3 to 5% normal human serum in their inactivation assays. The example below used 40% normal human serum to conduct the inactivation assay on NDV that has incorporated the recombinant fusion protein. 
BRIEF ","In accordance with the fusion protein of this invention any CD55 peptide sequence can be utilized for sequence (a). In an embodiment the CD55 peptide sequence is a human CD55 peptide sequence. The CD55 peptide sequence preferably comprises four short consensus repeats (SCR) of CD55.

In one embodiment the transmembrane domain is a CD8 transmembrane domain. Any intracellular domain can be utilized for sequence (d), for example a conventional intracellular domain. In one embodiment the transmembrane domain is a CD8 transmembrane domain, preferably a truncated CD8 transmembrane domain. The fusion protein of this invention can further comprise a secretory signal peptide N-terminal to sequence (a). In accordance with the preferred process of this invention the fusion protein is initially expressed with the signal peptide. The signal peptide directs the newly synthesized fusion protein to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where the signal peptide is cleaved by signal peptidase. SEQ ID NO:2 is an exemplary fusion protein of this invention having an N-terminal signal peptide. SEQ ID NO:3 is an exemplary fusion protein of this invention not having an N-terminal signal peptide.

SEQ ID NO:1 is one example of a nucleic acid encoding a protein having the sequence SEQ ID NO:2.

The flexible linker is followed by a CD8 transmembrane domain and a truncated CD8 intracellular domain. Example 2 The mammalian expression construct was transfected into chicken embryonic fibroblast DF1 cells via PEI 25K (polyethylenimine, linear 25 kDa, Polysciences, Cat. No. 23966) mediated transfection. Seventy two hours post-transfection, the transfected cells were selected in 300 μg/mL G418 (Geneticin®, aminoglycoside antibiotic) to create a stable cell line that constitutively expresses SEQ ID NO:2. The stable cell line constitutively expressed SEQ ID NO:3 on its cell surface as detected by a monoclonal antibody (R&D Systems, Catalog No. MAB20091) that is specific for mature human CD55. As shown in FIG. 3, the recombinant fusion protein was expressed on the DF1 cells stably transfected with the construct that encodes the recombinant fusion protein as analyzed by flow cytometry (FIG. 3, the histogram on the right). The naïve DF1 cells served as a negative control (FIG. 3, the histogram on the left). Example 3 The stable cell line expressing SEQ ID NO:3 on the cell surface was infected with wild type NDV that was produced from embryonated chicken eggs. The virus was then titered on human tumor cell line HT1080. Equal amount of virus (measured by PFU) was subjected to incubation with 40% normal human serum (NHS) and 40% heat-inactivated normal human serum (iNHS) respectively. The virus that remained alive after incubation with human serum was then scored on HT1080 cells by plaque assay. The ratio of virus recovered after incubation with NHS vs iNHS was calculated. As shown in Table 1, the recovery rate for the virus produced in embryonated chicken eggs was 0.5%, suggesting vast majority of the NDV particles produced by chicken eggs were inactivated most likely by human alternative complement pathway. Likewise, the recovery rate for the virus produced by the parental chicken embryonic fibroblast DF1 cells was 0.5%. Surprisingly, the recovery rate for the virus produced from the bulk non-clonal DF1 cells that stably expressed SEQ ID NO:3 on the cell surface was 5.8%, greater than 10 fold more than the wild type virus. When a total of 11 clonal populations of DF1 cells expressing SEQ ID NO:3 were examined, the recovery rate ranged from 0.8 to 20% with five clones scoring a lower recovery rate and six clones scoring a higher recovery rate than the bulk non-clonal cell line (Table 1). The virus generated by clone number 8 had a recovery rate of 10% which was 20 fold higher than the virus either produced by embryonated chicken eggs or the parental DF1 cells. The virus generated by clone number 40 had a recovery rate of 20% which was 40 fold higher than the virus either produced by embryonated chicken eggs or the parental DF1 cells. These data strongly suggest that the complement activity presented in normal human serum rapidly destroyed the NDV particles that were produced by embryonated chicken eggs or the parental chicken embryonic fibroblast DF1 cells. However, the new NDV particles produced by DF-1 cells that stably expressed recombinant complement inhibitor on the cell surface showed a remarkable up to 40-fold higher recovery rate as compared to the virus either produced by chicken eggs or the parental DF1 cells after incubation with 40% normal human serum under identical experimental conditions.

 Example 4 The broad spectrum oncolytic activity of NDV that was produced from the DF1 cells stably expressing the complement inhibitory fusion protein on their cell surface (Clone Number 8) was assessed using CellTiter96® AQueous One Solution. This solution functions similar to MTT (i.e., 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assays where metabolically active cells are able to bio-reduce MTS tetrazolium (i.e., 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium) in the reagent into soluble chromogenic formazan. Briefly, three different tumor cell lines HT1080 (fibrosarcoma), PANC-1 (pancreatic epithelial carcinoma) and OV-CARS (ovarian adenocarcinoma) where grown in separate 96 well plates. The following day, serial dilutions of the NDV virus were added to respective wells and the plate was incubated for 6 days at 37° C. incubator with 5% CO2. On Day 6, the absorbance of all wells on each plate was measured at 490 nm using a spectrophotometer. IC50 was calculated using 4 parameter logistic nonlinear regression analysis for each cell line. This resulted in final IC50 values of 255, 120 and 47 pfu/well for HT1080, OV-CAR-3 and PANC-1 cell lines respectively (FIG. 4). These results indicate that the NDV particles produced by DF-1 cells that stably expressed recombinant complement inhibitor on its cell surface retain the ability to lyse various tumor cell lines in a dose dependent manner.

The material contained in this text file is incorporated by reference in its entirety for all purposes. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Siglec-7, also known as p75 or AIRM, is a member of the sialic acid-binding lectins (Siglec) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Siglec receptors bind glycans containing sialic acid, but differ in their recognition of the linkage regiochemistry and spatial distribution of sialic residues. The members of the family also have distinct expression patterns. High level expression of Siglec-7 has been observed on Natural Killer (NK) cells. Expression has also been observed on a subset CD8+ T cells. Siglec-7 has also been observed to have an inhibitory role on NK cell-mediated tumor clearance (Jandus, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 124: 1810-20, 2014); Hudak et al., Nat. Chem. Biol. 10:69-77, 2014). A broad range of human malignancies overexpress Siglec-7 ligands sialoglycans, including sialocglycans that are the ligands for Siglec-7. Siglec-7 has also been observed to have an inhibitory role on NK cell-mediated tumor clearance (Jandus, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 124: 1810-20, 2014). BRIEF SUMMARY OF ASPECTS OF THE DISCLOSURE The disclosure is based, in part, on the discovery that an elevated level of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells express Siglec-7; and further, that an antibody that blocks Siglec-7-ligand binding interactions and/or decreases the level of Siglec-7 that is expressed on CD8+ cells increases killing of tumor cells. Accordingly, the disclosure provides antibodies and uses of such antibodies for inhibiting tumor growth. In one aspect, the disclosure provides a method of inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-Siglec-7 antibody to a patient that has cancer, wherein the patient has a primary tumor or metastatic lesion that comprises an elevated level of CD8+ infiltrating-T cells that express Siglec-7, and further, wherein the tumor or metastatic lesion comprises cancer cells that express sialylated Siglec-7 ligands.

 DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ASPECTS OF THE DISCLOSURE Terminology As used in herein, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “an antibody” optionally includes a combination of two or more such molecules, and the like. The term “about” as used herein refers to the usual error range for the respective value readily known to the skilled person in this technical field, for example ±20%, ±10%, or ±5%, are within the intended meaning of the recited value. Siglec-7, also known as p75 or AIRM, is a member of the sialic acid-binding lectins (Siglec) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Siglec receptors bind glycans containing sialic acid, but differ in their recognition of specific carbohydrate structures. A human Siglec-7 protein sequence available under accession number NP_055200.1 is

 The term “antibody” is used herein in the broadest sense and encompasses various antibody structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies, such as bispecific antibodies, and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity. The term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and/or bind the same epitope, except for possible variant antibodies, e.g., containing naturally occurring mutations or arising during production of a monoclonal antibody preparation, such variants generally being present in minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. Thus, the modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including but not limited to the hybridoma method, recombinant DNA methods, phage-display methods, and methods utilizing transgenic animals containing all or part of the human immunoglobulin loci. An “antibody fragment” refers to a molecule other than an intact antibody that comprises a portion of an intact antibody and that binds the antigen to which the intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab′, Fab′-SH, F(ab′)2; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules, such as scFv molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. An “antibody that binds to the same epitope” as a reference antibody refers to an antibody that blocks binding of the reference antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more, and conversely, the reference antibody blocks binding of the antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more. An exemplary competition assay is provided herein. As used herein, “V-region” refers to an antibody variable region domain comprising the segments of Framework 1, CDR1, Framework 2, CDR2, and Framework 3, including CDR3 and Framework 4, which segments are added to the V-segment as a consequence of rearrangement of the heavy chain and light chain V-region genes during B-cell differentiation. As used herein, “complementarity-determining region (CDR)” refers to the three hypervariable regions (HVRs) in each chain that interrupt the four “framework” regions established by the light and heavy chain variable regions. The CDRs are the primary contributors to binding to an epitope of an antigen. The CDRs of each chain are referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, numbered sequentially starting from the N-terminus, and are also identified by the chain in which the particular CDR is located. Thus, a VH CDR3 is located in the variable domain of the heavy chain of the antibody in which it is found, whereas a VL CDR1 is the CDR1 from the variable domain of the light chain of the antibody in which it is found. The term “CDR” may be used interchangeably with “HVR”. The amino acid sequences of the CDRs and framework regions can be determined using various well known definitions in the art, e.g., Kabat, Chothia, international ImMunoGeneTics database (IMGT), and AbM (see, e.g., Johnson et al., supra; Chothia & Lesk, 1987, Canonical structures for the hypervariable regions of immunoglobulins. J. Mol. Biol. 196, 901-917; Chothia C. et al., 1989, Conformations of immunoglobulin hypervariable regions. Nature 342, 877-883; Chothia C. et al., 1992, structural repertoire of the human VH segments J. Mol. Biol. 227, 799-817; Al-Lazikani et al., J. Mol. Biol 1997, 273(4)). Definitions of antigen combining sites are also described in the following: Ruiz et al., IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database. Nucleic Acids Res., 28, 219-221 (2000); and Lefranc, M.-P. IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database. Nucleic Acids Res. January 1; 29(1):207-9 (2001); MacCallum et al, Antibody-antigen interactions: Contact analysis and binding site topography, J. Mol. Biol., 262 (5), 732-745 (1996); and Martin et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 86, 9268-9272 (1989); Martin, et al, Methods Enzymol., 203, 121-153, (1991); Pedersen et al, Immunomethods, 1, 126, (1992); and Rees et al, In Stemberg M. J. E. (ed.), Protein Structure Prediction. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 141-172 1996). Reference to CDRs as determined by Kabat numbering are based, for example, on Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). Chothia CDRs are determined as defined by Chothia (see, e.g., Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). “Epitope” or “antigenic determinant” refers to a site on an antigen to which an antibody binds. Epitopes can be formed both from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation. Methods of determining spatial conformation of epitopes include, for example, x-ray crystallography and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66, Glenn E. Morris, Ed (1996). As used herein, “chimeric antibody” refers to an immunoglobulin molecule in which (a) the constant region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced or exchanged so that the antigen binding site (variable region) is linked to a constant region of a different or altered class, effector function and/or species, or an entirely different molecule which confers new properties to the chimeric antibody, e.g., an enzyme, toxin, hormone, growth factor, drug, etc.; or (b) the variable region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced or exchanged with a variable region, or portion thereof, having a different or altered antigen specificity; or with corresponding sequences from another species or from another antibody class or subclass. An “Fc region” refers to the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus, Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cγ2 and Cγ3 and the hinge between Cγ1 and Cγ. It is understood in the art that the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, however, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, using the numbering according to the EU index as in Kabat et al. (1991, NIH Publication 91-3242, National Technical Information Service, Springfield, Va.). The term “Fc region” may refer to this region in isolation or this region in the context of an antibody or antibody fragment. “Fc region” includes naturally occurring allelic variants of the Fc region as well as modifications that modulate effector function. Fc regions also include variants that don't result in alterations to biological function. For example, one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin without substantial loss of biological function. Such variants can be selected according to general rules known in the art so as to have minimal effect on activity (see, e.g., Bowie, et al., Science 247:306-1310, 1990). For example, for IgG4 antibodies, a single amino acid substitution (S228P according to Kabat numbering; designated IgG4Pro) may be introduced to abolish the heterogeneity observed in recombinant IgG4 antibody (see, e.g., Angal, et al., Mol Immunol 30:105-108, 1993). The term “equilibrium dissociation constant” abbreviated (KD), refers to the dissociation rate constant (kd, time−1) divided by the association rate constant (ka, time−1 M−1). Equilibrium dissociation constants can be measured using any method. Thus, in some embodiments antibodies of the present disclosure have a KD of less than about 50 nM, typically less than about 25 nM, or less than 10 nM, e.g., less than about 5 nM or than about 1 nM and often less than about 10 nM as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis using a biosensor system such as a Biacore® system performed at 37° C. In some embodiments, an antibody of the present disclosure has a KD of less than 5×10−5 M, less than 10−5 M, less than 5×10−6 M, less than 10−6 M, less than 5×10−7 M, less than 10−7 M, less than 5×10−8 M, less than 10−8 M, less than 5×10−9 M, less than 10−9 M, less than 5×10−10 M, less than 10−10 M, less than 5×10−11 M, less than 10−11 M, less than 5×10−12 M, less than 10−12 M, less than 5×10−13 M, less than 10−13 M, less than 5×10−14 M, less than 10−14 M, less than 5×10−15 M, or less than 10−15 M or lower as measured as a bivalent antibody. In the context of the present invention, an “improved” KD refers to a lower KD. In some embodiments, an antibody of the present disclosure has a KD of less than 5×10−5 M, less than 10−5 M, less than 5×10−6 M, less than 10−6 M, less than 5×10−7 M, less than 10−7 M, less than 5×10−8 M, less than 10−8 M, less than 5×10−9 M, less than 10−9 M, less than 5×10−10 M, less than 10−10 M, less than 5×10−11 M, less than 10−11 M, less than 5×10−12 M, less than 10−12 M, less than 5×10−13 M, less than 10−13 M, less than 5×10−14 M, less than 10−14 M, less than 5×10−15 M, or less than 10−15 M or lower as measured as a monovalent antibody, typically a monovalent Fab. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody of the present disclosure has KD less than 100 pM, e.g., or less than 75 pM, e.g., in the range of 1 to 100 pM, when measured as a monovalent Fab by surface plasmon resonance analysis using a biosensor system such as a Biacore® system performed at 37° C. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody of the present disclosure has KD less than 500 pM, e.g., in the range of 1 to 500 pM, or 1 to 200, or 1 to 250 pM, when measured as a monovalent Fab by surface plasmon resonance analysis using a biosensor system such as a Biacore® system performed at 37° C. In the context of the present invention, an “improved” KD refers to a lower KD. The term “monovalent molecule” as used herein refers to a molecule that has one antigen-binding site, e.g., a Fab. The term “bivalent molecule” as used herein refers to a molecule that has two antigen-binding sites. In some embodiments, a bivalent molecule of the present invention is a bivalent antibody or a bivalent fragment thereof. In some embodiments, a bivalent molecule of the present invention is a bivalent antibody. In some embodiments, a bivalent molecule of the present invention is an IgG. In general monoclonal antibodies have a bivalent basic structure. IgG and IgE have only one bivalent unit, while IgA and IgM consist of multiple bivalent units (2 and 5, respectively) and thus have higher valencies. This bivalency increases the avidity of antibodies for antigens. The terms “monovalent binding” or “monovalently binds to” as used herein refer to the binding of one antigen-binding site to its antigen. The terms “bivalent binding” or “bivalently binds to” as used herein refer to the binding of both antigen-binding sites of a bivalent molecule to its antigen. Preferably both antigen-binding sites of a bivalent molecule share the same antigen specificity. The term “valency” as used herein refers to the number of different binding sites of an antibody for an antigen. A monovalent antibody comprises one binding site for an antigen. A bivalent antibody comprises two binding sites for the same antigen. The term “avidity” as used herein in the context of antibody binding to an antigen refers to the combined binding strength of multiple binding sites of the antibody. Thus, “bivalent avidity” refers to the combined strength of two binding sites. The phrase “specifically (or selectively) binds” to an antigen or target or “specifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with,” when referring to a protein or peptide, refers to a binding reaction whereby the antibody binds to the antigen or target of interest. In the context of this invention, the antibody binds to SIGLEC-7 with a KD that is at least 100-fold greater than its affinity for other antigens. The terms “identical” or percent “identity,” in the context of two or more polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues that are the same (e.g., at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or higher) identity over a specified region, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be performed in various methods, including those using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Examples examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity the BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (1977) and Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990). Thus, BLAST 2.0 can be used with the default parameters described to determine percent sequence. A “conservative” substitution as used herein refers to a substitution of an amino acid such that charge, hydrophobicity, and/or size of the side group chain is maintained. Illustrative sets of amino acids that may be substituted for one another include (i) positively-charged amino acids Lys, Arg and His; (ii) negatively charged amino acids Glu and Asp; (iii) aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr and Trp; (iv) nitrogen ring amino acids His and Trp; (v) large aliphatic nonpolar amino acids Val, Leu and Ile; (vi) slightly polar amino acids Met and Cys; (vii) small-side chain amino acids Ser, Thr, Asp, Asn, Gly, Ala, Glu, Gln and Pro; (viii) aliphatic amino acids Val, Leu, Ile, Met and Cys; and (ix) small hydroxyl amino acids Ser and Thr. Reference to the charge of an amino acid in this paragraph refers to the charge at physiological pH. Anti-Siglec-7 Antibodies Anti-Siglec-7 antibodies of the invention have improved binding characteristics compared to known anti-Siglec 7 antibodies, such as improved internalization activity and/or improved ligand-blocking activity. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention has internalizing activity, but does not block ligand binding. An antibody of the invention typically has a lower KD when compared to known anti-Siglec 7 monoclonal antibodies such as Z176, QA79, and S7.7. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention has a KD of less than about 100 pM, or less than about 75 pM, or less than about 50 pM, or less than about 40 pM or less than about 35 pM. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention has a KD of about 1 pM or less. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention has at least one, at least two, or three CDRs of a VH sequence of the antibody designated as 16H11, 3F1, SL9, 8A2, 5D1, or 5G10 in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention that has an improved KD has at least one, at least two, or three CDRs of a VL sequence of the antibody designated as 16H11, 3F1, SL9, 8A2, 5D1, or 5G10 in FIG. 3. In embodiments has six CDRs of an antibody designated as 16H11, 3F1, SL9, 8A2, 5D1, or 5G10 in FIGS. 1-3. In some embodiments, has an enhanced ability to block ligand binding compared to previously characterized anti-Siglec 7 monoclonal antibodies. In the context of the present invention, the ability to block ligand binding refers to the concentration of monoclonal antibody at which 50% of Siglec-7 does not bind ligand. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention is more potent in ligand-blocking activity, i.e., the IC50 for an antibody for ligand blocking, is lower than that of a known antibody, such as such as Z176, QA79, and S7. Ligand blocking activity can be assessed using known assays. For example, ligand blocking activity may be determined using a cell line, such as the human melanoma cell line A375, that expresses high levels of ligands for Siglec-7 on the cell surface. IC50 values for blocking can be determined, for example, as explained in the examples section. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention that has improved ligand blocking activity has an IC50 of less than 4000 pM, or less than about 3500 pM or less than about 3000 pM or less than about 2000 pM or less than about 1500 pM or less than about 1000 pM or about 500 pM or less when assayed under the assay conditions described in the Examples section. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention that exhibits improved ligand blocking activity has at least one, at least two, or three CDRs of a VH sequence of the antibody designated as 9D4, SL13, or 5G10 in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention has at least one, at least two, or three CDRs of a VL sequence of the antibody designated as 9D4, SL13, or 5G10 in FIG. 3. In embodiments has six CDRs of an antibody designated as 9D4, SL13, or 5G10 in FIGS. 1-3. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody of the present invention exhibits improved internalization compared to previously characterized anti-Siglec-7 monoclonal antibodies. In the present disclosure, internalization activity refers to the concentration of antibody at which 50% of Siglec-7 is internalized in 24 hours on healthy donor Natural Killer (NK) cells. In the context of the present invention, an “enhanced” or “improved” internalization activity means that the IC50 for internalization is lower than that of a known antibody, such as such as Z176, QA79, and S7. Internalization can be assessed using known assays. For example, PBMC obtained from healthy donors may be used to determine internalization activity of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies. IC50 values for internalization can be determined, for example, as described in the Examples section. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention has an internalizing IC50 of less than about 70 pM, In some embodiments, an antibody has an internalizing IC50 of less than about 60 pM, or less than about 50 pM, or less than about 40 pM, or less than about 30 pM, or less than about 25 pM, or less than about 20, or less than about 10 pM when assayed under the assay conditions described in the Examples section. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention having an improved internalization activity has at least one, at least two, or three CDRs of a VH sequence of the antibody designated as 3F1, SL9, 16H11, 8A2, SL2, 5D1, or 10E11 in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2.

In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody of the present invention comprises a heavy chain variable region having at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of a heavy chain variable region of SEQ ID NO: 104 or 106; and a light chain variable region having at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or 100% sequence identity to the amino acid sequence of a light chain variable region of SEQ ID NO: 105 or 107. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-7 antibody has a modification to the heavy chain variable region and/or the light chain variable region as described in the preceding two paragraphs. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region that comprises a CDR3 as set forth SEQ ID NO:104 or 106 in which 1, 2, or 3 amino acids are substituted, e.g., conservatively substituted; or 1 or 2 amino acids are substituted, e.g., conservatively substituted.

In a further aspect of the invention, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody according to any of the above embodiments is a monoclonal antibody, including a chimeric, humanized or human antibody. In one embodiment, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody is an antibody fragment, e.g., a Fv, Fab, Fab′, scFv, diabody, or F(ab′)2 fragment. In another embodiment, the antibody is a substantially full length antibody, e.g., an IgG antibody or other antibody class or isotype as defined herein. For a review of certain antibody fragments, see Hudson et al. Nat. Med. 9: 129-134 (2003). Antibody fragments can be made by various techniques, including but not limited to proteolytic digestion of an intact antibody as well as production by recombinant host cells (e.g. E. coli or phage), as described herein. In some embodiments an anti-Siglec-7 antibody in accordance with the present disclosure is a ligand blocking antibody in a monovalent format. In some embodiments, the nati-Siglec-7 antibody is in a fragment format, e.g., a Fv, Fab, Fab′, scFv, diabody, or F(ab′)2 fragment. In some embodiments, an antibody in a monovalent or fragment format is modified, for example by PEGylation, to extend half-life. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody of the present invention is employed in a bispecific or multi-specific format. For example, in some embodiments, the antibody may be incorporated into a bispecific or multi-specific antibody that comprises a therapeutic antibody, as further discussed below. Fc Engineering In some embodiments, an antibody of the present disclosure comprises an Fc region. The Fc region may be an Fc region engineered to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as serum half-life, complement fixation, Fc receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, an antibody of the disclosure may be chemically modified (e.g., one or more chemical moieties can be attached to the antibody) or be modified to alter its glycosylation, again to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody In one embodiment, the hinge region of CH1 is modified such that the number of cysteine residues in the hinge region is altered, e.g., increased or decreased. This approach is described further in U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,425 by Bodmer et al. The number of cysteine residues in the hinge region of CH1 is altered to, for example, facilitate assembly of the light and heavy chains or to increase or decrease the stability of the antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody of invention may have a human IgG4 Fc region modified to include a S228P substitution, where the amino acid residues are numbered according to the EU index as in Kabat. In other embodiments, the Fc region is altered by replacing at least one amino acid residue with a different amino acid residue to alter the effector functions of the antibody. For example, one or more amino acids can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has an altered binding for an effector ligand but retains the antigen-binding ability of the parent antibody. The effector ligand to which binding is altered can be, for example, an Fc receptor or the C1 component of complement. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260, both by Winter et al. In another embodiment, one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has altered C1 q binding and/or reduced or abolished complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551. In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues are altered to thereby alter the ability of the antibody to fix complement. This approach is described further in PCT Publication W01994/29351 by Bodmer et al. In yet another embodiment, the Fc region is modified to increase the ability of the antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to increase the affinity of the antibody for an Fc receptor by modifying one or more amino acids. This approach is described further in PCT Publication WO2000/42072 by Presta. Moreover, the binding sites on human IgG1 for FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII and FcR have been mapped and variants with improved binding have been described (see Shields et al., (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-6604). In still another embodiment, the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody or antibody having an altered glycosylation pattern can be made. Glycosylation can be altered, for example, to increase the affinity of the antibody for an antigen or, if made in the Fc region, to influence effector function. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861 by Co et al. Additionally or alternatively, an antibody can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody preparation having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the disclosure to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. For example, EP 1,176,195 by Hang et al. describes a cell line with a functionally disrupted FUT8 gene, which encodes a fucosyl-transferase, such that antibodies expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation. PCT Publication WO2003/035835 by Presta describes a variant CHO cell line, Lecl3 cells, with reduced ability to attach fucose to Asn(297)-linked carbohydrates, also resulting in hypofucosylation of antibodies expressed in that host cell (see also Shields et al., (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740). PCT Publication W01999/54342 by Umana et al. describes cell lines engineered to express glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl-transferases (e.g., beta (1,4)-N acetylglucosaminyl-transferase III (GnTIII)) such that antibodies expressed in the engineered cell lines exhibit increased bisecting GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC activity of the antibodies (see also Umana et al., (1999) Nat. Biotech. 17:176-180). In another embodiment, the antibody is modified to increase its biological half-life. Various approaches are possible. For example, one or more of the following mutations can be introduced: T252L, T254S, and T256F, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,375 to Ward. Alternatively, to increase the biological half-life, the antibody can be altered within the CH1 or CL region to contain a salvage receptor binding epitope taken from two loops of a CH2 region of an Fc region of an IgG, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,869,046 and 6,121,022 by Presta et al. Treatment of Cancer Anti-Siglec-7 antibodies of the invention can be used to treat any number of cancers. In some aspects of the present disclosure antibodies are used to treat cancers that exhibit infiltration of immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells, with high levels of Siglec-7 expression. In some embodiments, anti-Siglec-7 antibodies of the invention can be used to treat cancers that exhibit infiltration of NK cells or monocytes that express Siglec-7. In some aspects, the disclosure thus provides methods of identifying subjects who are candidates for treatment with an anti-Siglec-7 antibody. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides a method of identifying the level of infiltration of Siglec-7 expressing CD8+ T cells in a tumor sample obtained from a patient. In some embodiments, the tumor sample is from a primary tumor. In alternative embodiments, the tumor sample is a metastatic lesion. The level of expression of Siglec-7 on the surface of cells, e.g., T cells, can be measured using any assay, such as immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry. In the context of the determination of levels of expression of Siglec-7 on tumor-infiltrating T cells, “overexpression” of Siglec-7 is considered to be where at least 10%, at least 20%, or at least 25%, or at least 30%, or greater, of the cells being analyzed, e.g., CD8+ T cells, express detectable Siglec-7 on the cell surface. Thus, “overexpress” in this context refers to the percentage of T cells that express detectable Siglec-7. “Overexpression” in this context is synonymous with the term “elevated numbers” or “elevated levels” of T cells that express detectable Siglec-7 in referring to the percentage of T cells that express detectable Siglec-7. The level of Siglec-7 ligand expressed by a tumor is also typically evaluated. A tumor is considered to express Siglec-7 ligand when detectable binding of Siglec-7 is observed on the surface of tumor cells. In some embodiments, expression of Siglec-7 ligand on at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 50%, or greater of the tumor cells in a sample that is evaluated may be used as a selection criteria for determining a patient to be treated with an anti-Siglec-7 antibody.

In one aspect, methods of the disclosure comprise administering an anti-Siglec-7 antibody as a pharmaceutical composition to a cancer patient in a therapeutically effective amount using a dosing regimen suitable for treatment of the cancer. The composition can be formulated for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. One or more physiologically acceptable excipients or carriers can also be included in the compositions for proper formulation. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found, e.g., in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Edition, Philadelphia, Pa. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005. The anti-Siglec-7 antibody is provided in a solution suitable for administration to the patient, such as a sterile isotonic aqueous solution for injection. The antibody is dissolved or suspended at a suitable concentration in an acceptable carrier. In some embodiments the carrier is aqueous, e.g., water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, and the like. The compositions may contain auxillary pharmaceutical substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions are administered to a patient in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the disease or symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a “therapeutically effective dose.” A therapeutically effective dose is determined by monitoring a patient's response to therapy. Typical benchmarks indicative of a therapeutically effective dose include amelioration of symptoms of the disease in the patient. Amounts effective for this use will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the patient's health, including other factors such as age, weight, gender, administration route, etc. Single or multiple administrations of the antibody may be administered depending on the dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the patient. In any event, the methods provide a sufficient quantity of anti-Siglec-7 antibody to effectively treat the patient. An anti-Siglec-7 antibody can be administered by any suitable means, including, for example, parenteral, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, administration, as well as local administration, such as intratumor administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In some embodiments, the antibody may be administered by insufflation. In an illustrative embodiment, the antibody may be stored at 10 mg/ml in sterile isotonic aqueous saline solution for injection at 4° C. and is diluted in either 100 ml or 200 ml 0.9% sodium chloride for injection prior to administration to the patient. In some embodiments, the antibody is administered by intravenous infusion over the course of 1 hour at a dose of between 0.01 and 25 mg/kg. In other embodiments, the antibody is administered by intravenous infusion over a period of between 15 minutes and 2 hours. In still other embodiments, the administration procedure is via sub-cutaneous bolus injection. The dose of antibody is chosen in order to provide effective therapy for the patient and is in the range of less than 0.01 mg/kg body weight to about 25 mg/kg body weight or in the range 1 mg-2 g per patient. Preferably the dose is in the range 0.1-10 mg/kg or approximately 50 mg-1000 mg/patient. The dose may be repeated at an appropriate frequency which may be in the range once per day to once every three months, or every six months, depending on the pharmacokinetics of the antibody (e.g., half-life of the antibody in the circulation) and the pharmacodynamic response (e.g., the duration of the therapeutic effect of the antibody). In some embodiments, the in vivo half-life of between about 7 and about 25 days and antibody dosing is repeated between once per week and once every 3 months or once every 6 months. In other embodiments, the antibody is administered approximately once per month. An anti-Siglec-7 antibody of may be administered with one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g., chemotherapeutic agents and/or additional immunotherapies. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody can be administered in conjunction with another checkpoint inhibitor.

Cancer vaccines include Gardasil®, Cervarix®, sipuleucel-T (Provenge®), NeuVax™, HER-2 ICD peptide-based vaccine, HER-2/neu peptide vaccine, AdHER2/neu dendritic cell vaccine, HER-2 pulsed DC1 vaccine, Ad-sig-hMUC-1/ecdCD40L fusion protein vaccine, MVX-ONCO-1, hTERT/survivin/CMV multipeptide vaccine, E39, J65, PlOs-PADRE, rV-CEA-Tricom, GVAX®, Lucanix®, HER2 VRP, AVX901, ONT-10, ISA101, ADXS1 1-001, VGX-3100, INO-9012, GSK1437173A, BPX-501, AGS-003, IDC-G305, HyperAcute®-Renal (HAR) immunotherapy, Prevenarl3, MAGER-3.A1, NA17.A2, DCVax-Direct, latent membrane protein-2 (LMP2)-loaded dendritic cell vaccine (NCT02115126), HS410-101 (NCT02010203, Heat Biologies), EAU RF 2010-01 (NCT01435356, GSK), 140036 (NCT02015104, Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey), 130016 (NCTO 1730118, National Cancer Institute), MVX-201101 (NCT02193503, Maxivax SA), ITL-007-ATCR-MBC (NCT01741038, Immunovative Therapies, Limited), CDR0000644921 (NCT00923143, Abramson cancer center of the University of Pennsylvania), SuMo-Sec-01 (NCT00108875, Julius Maximilians Universitaet Hospital), or MCC-15651 (NCT01176474, Medarex, Inc, BMS). In the context of the present invention a therapeutic agent that is administered in conjunction with an anti-Siglec-7 antibody of the present invention can be administered prior to administrations of the anti-Siglec-7 antibody or after administration of the anti-Siglec-7 antibody. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody may be administered at the same time as the additional therapeutic agent. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non-critical parameters that can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. EXAMPLES Example 1. Siglec-7 Detection on Tumor-Infiltrating T Cells Samples comprising cells from primary human tumor specimens were prepared using the Mylteni GentleMACS instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting to determine immune cell surface markers including CD3, CD8, CD16, CD45 and 7-AAD as a viability marker. CD8+ T cells were identified and gated as 7-AAD-CD45+CD3+CD8+. Anti-Siglec-7-PE (clone S7.7 Biolegend) was used to detect Siglec-7 levels. The results demonstrated that both the percentage (FIG. 4) and the level (FIG. 5) of Siglec-7 expression is enhanced on CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells in a subset of tumors. Example 2. Siglec-7 Ligand Detection on Tumor Cells Ligand levels on tumor cells were also evaluated. Specific binding of recombinant Siglec-7-Fc fusion protein was used to assess Siglec-7 ligand levels on cells isolated form fresh primary tumors. As a specificity control, cells were treated with sialidase/neuraminidase (Roche) at 0.1 U/mL to remove sialic acids from the cell surface. The results demonstrated that Siglec-7 ligands are detected on tumor cells from various subsets of tumors (FIG. 6). Sialidase treatment of cells (i.e. “stripping” of sialoglycans from the cell membrane) eliminated binding. Example 3. Antibodies with Improved KD  A panel of antibodies was evaluated for binding to Siglec-7. The results identified anti-Siglec-7 antibodies that have improved KD values compared to commercially available anti-Siglec-7 antibodies (FIG. 7). Example 4. Antibodies with Siglec-7 Ligand Blocking Activity Recombinant Siglec-7-Fc was added to A375 cells in the presence of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies at increasing concentrations and binding of the complex was detected on the cell surface. The results showed that anti-Siglec-7 antibodies blocked the interaction of Siglec-7 with ligands present on the surface of A375 melanoma human cells with various potencies (FIG. 8) and demonstrated antibodies that have improved ligand blocking activity relative to commercially available anti-Siglec-7 antibodies. Example 5. Antibodies with Siglec-7 Internalization Activity Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were incubated with increasing concentrations of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies for 24 hours and remaining Siglec-7 in the cell surface of NK cells was detected using a non-competing anti-Siglec-7 antibody. The results showed that anti-Siglec-7 antibodies caused internalization of Siglec-7 on primary human NK cells with various potencies (FIG. 9) and demonstrated antibodies that have improved internalization activity compared to commercially available, or previously described, anti-Siglec-7 antibodies. Rapid, concentration-dependent antibody-induced internalization of Siglec-7 on human NK cells was further evaluated using monoclonal antibody 3F1. 3F1 showed more potent internalization activity compared to commercially available S7.7 antibody (FIG. 10) Evaluation of monoclonal antibody 8A2 (FIG. 11) demonstrated that the antibody did not block Siglec-7/ligand interaction (left panel), but caused internalization (right panel) of Siglec-7 on primary human immune cells. Example 6. Humanized Sequences Humanized antibodies were generated using monoclonal antibodies 16H11 and 8A2 to generate humanized internalizing anti-Siglec 7 antibodies. Humanized antibodies derived from 16H11 were evaluated for binding to Siglec 7. Antibody binding results (measured in the form of a monovalent Fab) are shown in Table 1. Antibodies having the following heavy and light chain variable regions demonstrated KD values (monovalent Fab) of about 75 nM or lower: VH438-4 and VL418-2; VH440-2 and VL418-2; VH441-2 and VL418-2; VH443-1 and VL418-2; VH444-2 and VL418-2, VH445-3 and VL418-2; VH449-4 and VL448-3; VH449-6 and VL418-2; VH387-11 and VL418-2; VH446-7 and VL418-2; VH 446-7 and VL448-3; VH463-2 and VL418-2; Vh463-2 and VL448-3; FH465-17 and VL418-2; VH484-6 and VL418-2; VH484-6 and VL448-3; and VH484-7 and VL448-3. The ligand blocking activity of the 16H11 anti-Siglec-7 antibody is preserved, as indicated by analysis of selected antibodies (indicated by the VH/VL pairs in Table 1): AK410-1/AK418-2, AK446-7/AK418-2, and AK446-7/AK448-3.

 Methods KD Measurements Antibody binding analysis was carried out by bio-layer interferometry (ForteBio). The assay was conducted at 25° C. in 1× ForteBio Kinetics buffer (ForteBio18-132) in ultrapure water. Antibodies were captured on anti-mouse kinetic sensors at 0.5 ug/mL; Siglec-7-ECD was used as analyte and diluted in assay buffer from 50 nM to 1.56 nM with 2× dilutions. Two-minute associations were conducted, followed by 10-minute dissociations. Results were determined relative to a control empty reference AHC sensor, and analyzed using ForteBio analysis software with 1:1 global fit parameters. Antibody Competition Using Fortebio Siglec-7-ECD-huFc was captured on anti-human IgG kinetic sensors at 0.5 ug/ml under saturating conditions (15 min at 1 ug/ml), after which the competing antibody was tested for binding. Each anti-Siglec-7 antibody was tested both ways (i.e. as saturating antibody and as competing antibody) against all other antibodies. When the antibody on the sensor competes with the antibody in solution, no additional binding to the antigen is observed. When a binding signal is observed, the two antibodies bind to the antigen in a non-competitive manner. Ligand Blocking Assay Human melanoma cell line A375, which expresses high level of ligands for Siglec-7, was used to determine the blocking activity of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies in a cell based assay. Two-fold serial dilutions of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies (40 nM to 40 pM) were combined with 10 nM Siglec-7-ECD-Fc in FACS buffer (PBS/2% BSA) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. 2.5×10e4 A375 cells per well were added to round bottom 96-well tissue culture plates in FACS buffer, plates were centrifuged at 400 g for 2 min, supernatant was removed and cells were re-suspended in 100 ul of the antibody-Siglec-7 complexes. After a 1 hour incubation on ice, cells were washed twice and incubated for 30 minutes with goat anti-human F(ab′)2 fragment conjugated to AF647 (Jackson IR labs) at 1 ug/ml in FACS buffer. After two more washes, cells were fixed in PBS/2% PFA and acquired on a Novocyte flow cytometer (ACEA biosciences). IC50 values for blocking were determined based on plotting mean fluorescence in the APC channel and analysis using Prism Graphpad software. Internalization Assay Healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear monocytes (PBMC) were used to determine internalization activity of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies. Previously cryopreserved PBMC were thawed and incubated for 90 minutes at 37° C. in complete medium (RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). Five-fold serial dilutions of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies (100 nM-0.01 pM) were prepared in complete medium. Cells (5×10e4 per well) and antibody dilutions were combined in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours. Cells were re-suspended in huFc block (Becton Dickinson) in FACS buffer and stained with an antibody cocktail containing CD3-FITC, CD16-PE and anti-Siglec-7 antibody 4B12-AF647 for 1 hour on ice. After two washes, cells were fixed in PBS/2% PFA and acquired on a Novocyte flow cytometer. IC50 values for internalization were determined based on plotting mean fluorescence in the APC channel on NK cells (gated as CD3-CD16+) and analysis using Prism Graphpad software. Primary Tumor Analysis Single cells from primary human tumor specimens were prepared using the Mylteni GentleMACS instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were re-suspended in huFc block (Becton Dickinson) in FACS buffer and staining was performed using cocktails containing conjugated antibodies against immune cell surface markers, including CD3, CD8, CD16, CD45 and 7-AAD as a viability marker. CD8+ T cells were identified and gated as 7-AAD-CD45+CD3+CD8+. Anti-Siglec-7-PE (clone S7.7 Biolegend) was used to detect Siglec-7 levels. Cells were fixed in PBS/2% PFA and acquired on a Novocyte cytometer. Gating and analysis was performed using Flowjo software (Tristar). Ligand levels on tumor cells were detected using Siglec-7-ECD-Fc as described under Ligand blocking assay above. As a specificity control, cells were treated with sialidase/neuraminidase (Roche) at 0.1 U/mL to remove sialic acids from the cell surface.

Siglec receptors bind glycans containing sialic acid, but differ in their recognition of the linkage regiochemistry and spatial distribution of sialic residues. The members of the family also have distinct expression patterns. High level expression of Siglec-7 has been observed on Natural Killer (NK) cells. Expression has also been observed on a subset CD8+ T cells. Siglec-7 has also been observed to have an inhibitory role on NK cell-mediated tumor clearance (Jandus, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 124: 1810-20, 2014); Hudak et al., Nat. Chem. Biol. 10:69-77, 2014). A broad range of human malignancies overexpress Siglec-7 ligands sialoglycans, including sialocglycans that are the ligands for Siglec-7. Siglec-7 has also been observed to have an inhibitory role on NK cell-mediated tumor clearance (Jandus, et al., J. Clin. Invest. 124: 1810-20, 2014). BRIEF ",,"The disclosure is based, in part, on the discovery that an elevated level of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells express Siglec-7; and further, that an antibody that blocks Siglec-7-ligand binding interactions and/or decreases the level of Siglec-7 that is expressed on CD8+ cells increases killing of tumor cells. Accordingly, the disclosure provides antibodies and uses of such antibodies for inhibiting tumor growth. In one aspect, the disclosure provides a method of inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells, the method comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of an anti-Siglec-7 antibody to a patient that has cancer, wherein the patient has a primary tumor or metastatic lesion that comprises an elevated level of CD8+ infiltrating-T cells that express Siglec-7, and further, wherein the tumor or metastatic lesion comprises cancer cells that express sialylated Siglec-7 ligands. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-7 antibody has a KD of 50 pM or less. In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-7 antibody blocks ligand binding at an IC50 of less than about 4000 pM, or blocks ligand binding at an IC50 of less than about 3500 pM, and optionally may have a KD of 50 pM or less.

BRIEF ","Terminology As used in herein, the singular forms “a”, “an” and “the” include plural referents unless the content clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “an antibody” optionally includes a combination of two or more such molecules, and the like. The term “about” as used herein refers to the usual error range for the respective value readily known to the skilled person in this technical field, for example ±20%, ±10%, or ±5%, are within the intended meaning of the recited value. Siglec-7, also known as p75 or AIRM, is a member of the sialic acid-binding lectins (Siglec) of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily. Siglec receptors bind glycans containing sialic acid, but differ in their recognition of specific carbohydrate structures. A human Siglec-7 protein sequence available under accession number NP_055200.1 is

 The term “antibody” is used herein in the broadest sense and encompasses various antibody structures, including but not limited to monoclonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, multispecific antibodies, such as bispecific antibodies, and antibody fragments so long as they exhibit the desired antigen-binding activity. The term “monoclonal antibody” as used herein refers to an antibody obtained from a population of substantially homogeneous antibodies, i.e., the individual antibodies comprising the population are identical and/or bind the same epitope, except for possible variant antibodies, e.g., containing naturally occurring mutations or arising during production of a monoclonal antibody preparation, such variants generally being present in minor amounts. In contrast to polyclonal antibody preparations, which typically include different antibodies directed against different determinants (epitopes), each monoclonal antibody of a monoclonal antibody preparation is directed against a single determinant on an antigen. Thus, the modifier “monoclonal” indicates the character of the antibody as being obtained from a substantially homogeneous population of antibodies, and is not to be construed as requiring production of the antibody by any particular method. For example, the monoclonal antibodies to be used in accordance with the present invention may be made by a variety of techniques, including but not limited to the hybridoma method, recombinant DNA methods, phage-display methods, and methods utilizing transgenic animals containing all or part of the human immunoglobulin loci. An “antibody fragment” refers to a molecule other than an intact antibody that comprises a portion of an intact antibody and that binds the antigen to which the intact antibody binds. Examples of antibody fragments include but are not limited to Fv, Fab, Fab′, Fab′-SH, F(ab′)2; diabodies; linear antibodies; single-chain antibody molecules, such as scFv molecules; and multispecific antibodies formed from antibody fragments. An “antibody that binds to the same epitope” as a reference antibody refers to an antibody that blocks binding of the reference antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more, and conversely, the reference antibody blocks binding of the antibody to its antigen in a competition assay by 50% or more. An exemplary competition assay is provided herein. As used herein, “V-region” refers to an antibody variable region domain comprising the segments of Framework 1, CDR1, Framework 2, CDR2, and Framework 3, including CDR3 and Framework 4, which segments are added to the V-segment as a consequence of rearrangement of the heavy chain and light chain V-region genes during B-cell differentiation. As used herein, “complementarity-determining region (CDR)” refers to the three hypervariable regions (HVRs) in each chain that interrupt the four “framework” regions established by the light and heavy chain variable regions. The CDRs are the primary contributors to binding to an epitope of an antigen. The CDRs of each chain are referred to as CDR1, CDR2, and CDR3, numbered sequentially starting from the N-terminus, and are also identified by the chain in which the particular CDR is located. Thus, a VH CDR3 is located in the variable domain of the heavy chain of the antibody in which it is found, whereas a VL CDR1 is the CDR1 from the variable domain of the light chain of the antibody in which it is found. The term “CDR” may be used interchangeably with “HVR”. The amino acid sequences of the CDRs and framework regions can be determined using various well known definitions in the art, e.g., Kabat, Chothia, international ImMunoGeneTics database (IMGT), and AbM (see, e.g., Johnson et al., supra; Chothia & Lesk, 1987, Canonical structures for the hypervariable regions of immunoglobulins. J. Mol. Biol. 196, 901-917; Chothia C. et al., 1989, Conformations of immunoglobulin hypervariable regions. Nature 342, 877-883; Chothia C. et al., 1992, structural repertoire of the human VH segments J. Mol. Biol. 227, 799-817; Al-Lazikani et al., J. Mol. Biol 1997, 273(4)). Definitions of antigen combining sites are also described in the following: Ruiz et al., IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database. Nucleic Acids Res., 28, 219-221 (2000); and Lefranc, M.-P. IMGT, the international ImMunoGeneTics database. Nucleic Acids Res. January 1; 29(1):207-9 (2001); MacCallum et al, Antibody-antigen interactions: Contact analysis and binding site topography, J. Mol. Biol., 262 (5), 732-745 (1996); and Martin et al, Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA, 86, 9268-9272 (1989); Martin, et al, Methods Enzymol., 203, 121-153, (1991); Pedersen et al, Immunomethods, 1, 126, (1992); and Rees et al, In Stemberg M. J. E. (ed.), Protein Structure Prediction. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 141-172 1996). Reference to CDRs as determined by Kabat numbering are based, for example, on Kabat et al., Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, 5th Ed. Public Health Service, National Institute of Health, Bethesda, Md. (1991)). Chothia CDRs are determined as defined by Chothia (see, e.g., Chothia and Lesk J. Mol. Biol. 196:901-917 (1987)). “Epitope” or “antigenic determinant” refers to a site on an antigen to which an antibody binds. Epitopes can be formed both from contiguous amino acids or noncontiguous amino acids juxtaposed by tertiary folding of a protein. Epitopes formed from contiguous amino acids are typically retained on exposure to denaturing solvents whereas epitopes formed by tertiary folding are typically lost on treatment with denaturing solvents. An epitope typically includes at least 3, and more usually, at least 5 or 8-10 amino acids in a unique spatial conformation. Methods of determining spatial conformation of epitopes include, for example, x-ray crystallography and 2-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance. See, e.g., Epitope Mapping Protocols in Methods in Molecular Biology, Vol. 66, Glenn E. Morris, Ed (1996). As used herein, “chimeric antibody” refers to an immunoglobulin molecule in which (a) the constant region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced or exchanged so that the antigen binding site (variable region) is linked to a constant region of a different or altered class, effector function and/or species, or an entirely different molecule which confers new properties to the chimeric antibody, e.g., an enzyme, toxin, hormone, growth factor, drug, etc.; or (b) the variable region, or a portion thereof, is altered, replaced or exchanged with a variable region, or portion thereof, having a different or altered antigen specificity; or with corresponding sequences from another species or from another antibody class or subclass. An “Fc region” refers to the constant region of an antibody excluding the first constant region immunoglobulin domain. Thus, Fc refers to the last two constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgA, IgD, and IgG, and the last three constant region immunoglobulin domains of IgE and IgM, and the flexible hinge N-terminal to these domains. For IgA and IgM Fc may include the J chain. For IgG, Fc comprises immunoglobulin domains Cγ2 and Cγ3 and the hinge between Cγ1 and Cγ. It is understood in the art that the boundaries of the Fc region may vary, however, the human IgG heavy chain Fc region is usually defined to comprise residues C226 or P230 to its carboxyl-terminus, using the numbering according to the EU index as in Kabat et al. (1991, NIH Publication 91-3242, National Technical Information Service, Springfield, Va.). The term “Fc region” may refer to this region in isolation or this region in the context of an antibody or antibody fragment. “Fc region” includes naturally occurring allelic variants of the Fc region as well as modifications that modulate effector function. Fc regions also include variants that don't result in alterations to biological function. For example, one or more amino acids can be deleted from the N-terminus or C-terminus of the Fc region of an immunoglobulin without substantial loss of biological function. Such variants can be selected according to general rules known in the art so as to have minimal effect on activity (see, e.g., Bowie, et al., Science 247:306-1310, 1990). For example, for IgG4 antibodies, a single amino acid substitution (S228P according to Kabat numbering; designated IgG4Pro) may be introduced to abolish the heterogeneity observed in recombinant IgG4 antibody (see, e.g., Angal, et al., Mol Immunol 30:105-108, 1993). The term “equilibrium dissociation constant” abbreviated (KD), refers to the dissociation rate constant (kd, time−1) divided by the association rate constant (ka, time−1 M−1). Equilibrium dissociation constants can be measured using any method. Thus, in some embodiments antibodies of the present disclosure have a KD of less than about 50 nM, typically less than about 25 nM, or less than 10 nM, e.g., less than about 5 nM or than about 1 nM and often less than about 10 nM as determined by surface plasmon resonance analysis using a biosensor system such as a Biacore® system performed at 37° C. In some embodiments, an antibody of the present disclosure has a KD of less than 5×10−5 M, less than 10−5 M, less than 5×10−6 M, less than 10−6 M, less than 5×10−7 M, less than 10−7 M, less than 5×10−8 M, less than 10−8 M, less than 5×10−9 M, less than 10−9 M, less than 5×10−10 M, less than 10−10 M, less than 5×10−11 M, less than 10−11 M, less than 5×10−12 M, less than 10−12 M, less than 5×10−13 M, less than 10−13 M, less than 5×10−14 M, less than 10−14 M, less than 5×10−15 M, or less than 10−15 M or lower as measured as a bivalent antibody. In the context of the present invention, an “improved” KD refers to a lower KD. In some embodiments, an antibody of the present disclosure has a KD of less than 5×10−5 M, less than 10−5 M, less than 5×10−6 M, less than 10−6 M, less than 5×10−7 M, less than 10−7 M, less than 5×10−8 M, less than 10−8 M, less than 5×10−9 M, less than 10−9 M, less than 5×10−10 M, less than 10−10 M, less than 5×10−11 M, less than 10−11 M, less than 5×10−12 M, less than 10−12 M, less than 5×10−13 M, less than 10−13 M, less than 5×10−14 M, less than 10−14 M, less than 5×10−15 M, or less than 10−15 M or lower as measured as a monovalent antibody, typically a monovalent Fab. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody of the present disclosure has KD less than 100 pM, e.g., or less than 75 pM, e.g., in the range of 1 to 100 pM, when measured as a monovalent Fab by surface plasmon resonance analysis using a biosensor system such as a Biacore® system performed at 37° C. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody of the present disclosure has KD less than 500 pM, e.g., in the range of 1 to 500 pM, or 1 to 200, or 1 to 250 pM, when measured as a monovalent Fab by surface plasmon resonance analysis using a biosensor system such as a Biacore® system performed at 37° C. In the context of the present invention, an “improved” KD refers to a lower KD. The term “monovalent molecule” as used herein refers to a molecule that has one antigen-binding site, e.g., a Fab. The term “bivalent molecule” as used herein refers to a molecule that has two antigen-binding sites. In some embodiments, a bivalent molecule of the present invention is a bivalent antibody or a bivalent fragment thereof. In some embodiments, a bivalent molecule of the present invention is a bivalent antibody. In some embodiments, a bivalent molecule of the present invention is an IgG. In general monoclonal antibodies have a bivalent basic structure. IgG and IgE have only one bivalent unit, while IgA and IgM consist of multiple bivalent units (2 and 5, respectively) and thus have higher valencies. This bivalency increases the avidity of antibodies for antigens. The terms “monovalent binding” or “monovalently binds to” as used herein refer to the binding of one antigen-binding site to its antigen. The terms “bivalent binding” or “bivalently binds to” as used herein refer to the binding of both antigen-binding sites of a bivalent molecule to its antigen. Preferably both antigen-binding sites of a bivalent molecule share the same antigen specificity. The term “valency” as used herein refers to the number of different binding sites of an antibody for an antigen. A monovalent antibody comprises one binding site for an antigen. A bivalent antibody comprises two binding sites for the same antigen. The term “avidity” as used herein in the context of antibody binding to an antigen refers to the combined binding strength of multiple binding sites of the antibody. Thus, “bivalent avidity” refers to the combined strength of two binding sites. The phrase “specifically (or selectively) binds” to an antigen or target or “specifically (or selectively) immunoreactive with,” when referring to a protein or peptide, refers to a binding reaction whereby the antibody binds to the antigen or target of interest. In the context of this invention, the antibody binds to SIGLEC-7 with a KD that is at least 100-fold greater than its affinity for other antigens. The terms “identical” or percent “identity,” in the context of two or more polypeptide sequences, refer to two or more sequences or subsequences that are the same or have a specified percentage of amino acid residues that are the same (e.g., at least 70%, at least 75%, at least 80%, 85%, 90%, 91%, 92%, 93%, 94%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99%, or higher) identity over a specified region, when compared and aligned for maximum correspondence over a comparison window or designated region. Alignment for purposes of determining percent amino acid sequence identity can be performed in various methods, including those using publicly available computer software such as BLAST, BLAST-2, ALIGN or Megalign (DNASTAR) software. Examples examples of algorithms that are suitable for determining percent sequence identity and sequence similarity the BLAST 2.0 algorithms, which are described in Altschul et al., Nuc. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402 (1977) and Altschul et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215:403-410 (1990). Thus, BLAST 2.0 can be used with the default parameters described to determine percent sequence. A “conservative” substitution as used herein refers to a substitution of an amino acid such that charge, hydrophobicity, and/or size of the side group chain is maintained. Illustrative sets of amino acids that may be substituted for one another include (i) positively-charged amino acids Lys, Arg and His; (ii) negatively charged amino acids Glu and Asp; (iii) aromatic amino acids Phe, Tyr and Trp; (iv) nitrogen ring amino acids His and Trp; (v) large aliphatic nonpolar amino acids Val, Leu and Ile; (vi) slightly polar amino acids Met and Cys; (vii) small-side chain amino acids Ser, Thr, Asp, Asn, Gly, Ala, Glu, Gln and Pro; (viii) aliphatic amino acids Val, Leu, Ile, Met and Cys; and (ix) small hydroxyl amino acids Ser and Thr. Reference to the charge of an amino acid in this paragraph refers to the charge at physiological pH. Anti-Siglec-7 Antibodies Anti-Siglec-7 antibodies of the invention have improved binding characteristics compared to known anti-Siglec 7 antibodies, such as improved internalization activity and/or improved ligand-blocking activity. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention has internalizing activity, but does not block ligand binding. An antibody of the invention typically has a lower KD when compared to known anti-Siglec 7 monoclonal antibodies such as Z176, QA79, and S7.7. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention has a KD of less than about 100 pM, or less than about 75 pM, or less than about 50 pM, or less than about 40 pM or less than about 35 pM.

In some embodiments, has an enhanced ability to block ligand binding compared to previously characterized anti-Siglec 7 monoclonal antibodies. In the context of the present invention, the ability to block ligand binding refers to the concentration of monoclonal antibody at which 50% of Siglec-7 does not bind ligand. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention is more potent in ligand-blocking activity, i.e., the IC50 for an antibody for ligand blocking, is lower than that of a known antibody, such as such as Z176, QA79, and S7. Ligand blocking activity can be assessed using known assays. For example, ligand blocking activity may be determined using a cell line, such as the human melanoma cell line A375, that expresses high levels of ligands for Siglec-7 on the cell surface. IC50 values for blocking can be determined, for example, as explained in the examples section. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention that has improved ligand blocking activity has an IC50 of less than 4000 pM, or less than about 3500 pM or less than about 3000 pM or less than about 2000 pM or less than about 1500 pM or less than about 1000 pM or about 500 pM or less when assayed under the assay conditions described in the Examples section.

In the context of the present invention, an “enhanced” or “improved” internalization activity means that the IC50 for internalization is lower than that of a known antibody, such as such as Z176, QA79, and S7. Internalization can be assessed using known assays. For example, PBMC obtained from healthy donors may be used to determine internalization activity of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies. IC50 values for internalization can be determined, for example, as described in the Examples section. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention has an internalizing IC50 of less than about 70 pM, In some embodiments, an antibody has an internalizing IC50 of less than about 60 pM, or less than about 50 pM, or less than about 40 pM, or less than about 30 pM, or less than about 25 pM, or less than about 20, or less than about 10 pM when assayed under the assay conditions described in the Examples section.

In the context of the present invention, an antibody that does not block binding of ligand to Siglec-7 refers to an antibody that does not result in more than a 25% reduction in ligand binding when assayed under conditions as explained in the Examples section. In some embodiments, an antibody of the invention that internalizes Siglec-7 ligand, but does not block ligand binding to Siglec-7 has at least one, at least two, or three CDRs of a VH sequence of the antibody designated as 4B12 or 8A2 in FIG. 1 or FIG. 2.

In some embodiments, the anti-Siglec-7 antibody has a modification to the heavy chain variable region and/or the light chain variable region as described in the preceding two paragraphs. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody comprises a heavy chain variable region that comprises a CDR3 as set forth SEQ ID NO:104 or 106 in which 1, 2, or 3 amino acids are substituted, e.g., conservatively substituted; or 1 or 2 amino acids are substituted, e.g., conservatively substituted.

In a further aspect of the invention, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody according to any of the above embodiments is a monoclonal antibody, including a chimeric, humanized or human antibody. In one embodiment, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody is an antibody fragment, e.g., a Fv, Fab, Fab′, scFv, diabody, or F(ab′)2 fragment. In another embodiment, the antibody is a substantially full length antibody, e.g., an IgG antibody or other antibody class or isotype as defined herein. For a review of certain antibody fragments, see Hudson et al. Nat. Med. 9: 129-134 (2003). Antibody fragments can be made by various techniques, including but not limited to proteolytic digestion of an intact antibody as well as production by recombinant host cells (e.g. E. coli or phage), as described herein. In some embodiments an anti-Siglec-7 antibody in accordance with the present disclosure is a ligand blocking antibody in a monovalent format. In some embodiments, the nati-Siglec-7 antibody is in a fragment format, e.g., a Fv, Fab, Fab′, scFv, diabody, or F(ab′)2 fragment. In some embodiments, an antibody in a monovalent or fragment format is modified, for example by PEGylation, to extend half-life. In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody of the present invention is employed in a bispecific or multi-specific format. For example, in some embodiments, the antibody may be incorporated into a bispecific or multi-specific antibody that comprises a therapeutic antibody, as further discussed below. Fc Engineering In some embodiments, an antibody of the present disclosure comprises an Fc region. The Fc region may be an Fc region engineered to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody, such as serum half-life, complement fixation, Fc receptor binding, and/or antigen-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. Furthermore, an antibody of the disclosure may be chemically modified (e.g., one or more chemical moieties can be attached to the antibody) or be modified to alter its glycosylation, again to alter one or more functional properties of the antibody In one embodiment, the hinge region of CH1 is modified such that the number of cysteine residues in the hinge region is altered, e.g., increased or decreased. This approach is described further in U.S. Pat. No. 5,677,425 by Bodmer et al. The number of cysteine residues in the hinge region of CH1 is altered to, for example, facilitate assembly of the light and heavy chains or to increase or decrease the stability of the antibody. In one embodiment, an antibody of invention may have a human IgG4 Fc region modified to include a S228P substitution, where the amino acid residues are numbered according to the EU index as in Kabat. In other embodiments, the Fc region is altered by replacing at least one amino acid residue with a different amino acid residue to alter the effector functions of the antibody. For example, one or more amino acids can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has an altered binding for an effector ligand but retains the antigen-binding ability of the parent antibody. The effector ligand to which binding is altered can be, for example, an Fc receptor or the C1 component of complement. This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,624,821 and 5,648,260, both by Winter et al. In another embodiment, one or more amino acids selected from amino acid residues can be replaced with a different amino acid residue such that the antibody has altered C1 q binding and/or reduced or abolished complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC). This approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. No. 6,194,551. In another embodiment, one or more amino acid residues are altered to thereby alter the ability of the antibody to fix complement. This approach is described further in PCT Publication W01994/29351 by Bodmer et al. In yet another embodiment, the Fc region is modified to increase the ability of the antibody to mediate antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and/or to increase the affinity of the antibody for an Fc receptor by modifying one or more amino acids. This approach is described further in PCT Publication WO2000/42072 by Presta. Moreover, the binding sites on human IgG1 for FcγRI, FcγRII, FcγRIII and FcR have been mapped and variants with improved binding have been described (see Shields et al., (2001) J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591-6604). In still another embodiment, the glycosylation of an antibody is modified. For example, an aglycoslated antibody or antibody having an altered glycosylation pattern can be made. Glycosylation can be altered, for example, to increase the affinity of the antibody for an antigen or, if made in the Fc region, to influence effector function. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, altering one or more sites of glycosylation within the antibody sequence. For example, one or more amino acid substitutions can be made that result in elimination of one or more variable region framework glycosylation sites to thereby eliminate glycosylation at that site. Such aglycosylation may increase the affinity of the antibody for antigen. Such an approach is described in further detail in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,714,350 and 6,350,861 by Co et al. Additionally or alternatively, an antibody can be made that has an altered type of glycosylation, such as a hypofucosylated antibody preparation having reduced amounts of fucosyl residues or an antibody having increased bisecting GlcNac structures. Such altered glycosylation patterns have been demonstrated to increase the ADCC ability of antibodies. Such carbohydrate modifications can be accomplished by, for example, expressing the antibody in a host cell with altered glycosylation machinery. Cells with altered glycosylation machinery have been described in the art and can be used as host cells in which to express recombinant antibodies of the disclosure to thereby produce an antibody with altered glycosylation. For example, EP 1,176,195 by Hang et al. describes a cell line with a functionally disrupted FUT8 gene, which encodes a fucosyl-transferase, such that antibodies expressed in such a cell line exhibit hypofucosylation. PCT Publication WO2003/035835 by Presta describes a variant CHO cell line, Lecl3 cells, with reduced ability to attach fucose to Asn(297)-linked carbohydrates, also resulting in hypofucosylation of antibodies expressed in that host cell (see also Shields et al., (2002) J. Biol. Chem. 277:26733-26740). PCT Publication W01999/54342 by Umana et al. describes cell lines engineered to express glycoprotein-modifying glycosyl-transferases (e.g., beta (1,4)-N acetylglucosaminyl-transferase III (GnTIII)) such that antibodies expressed in the engineered cell lines exhibit increased bisecting GlcNac structures which results in increased ADCC activity of the antibodies (see also Umana et al., (1999) Nat. Biotech. 17:176-180). In another embodiment, the antibody is modified to increase its biological half-life. Various approaches are possible. For example, one or more of the following mutations can be introduced: T252L, T254S, and T256F, as described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,277,375 to Ward. Alternatively, to increase the biological half-life, the antibody can be altered within the CH1 or CL region to contain a salvage receptor binding epitope taken from two loops of a CH2 region of an Fc region of an IgG, as described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,869,046 and 6,121,022 by Presta et al. Treatment of Cancer Anti-Siglec-7 antibodies of the invention can be used to treat any number of cancers. In some aspects of the present disclosure antibodies are used to treat cancers that exhibit infiltration of immune cells, such as CD8+ T cells, with high levels of Siglec-7 expression. In some embodiments, anti-Siglec-7 antibodies of the invention can be used to treat cancers that exhibit infiltration of NK cells or monocytes that express Siglec-7. In some aspects, the disclosure thus provides methods of identifying subjects who are candidates for treatment with an anti-Siglec-7 antibody. Thus, in one embodiment, the invention provides a method of identifying the level of infiltration of Siglec-7 expressing CD8+ T cells in a tumor sample obtained from a patient. In some embodiments, the tumor sample is from a primary tumor. In alternative embodiments, the tumor sample is a metastatic lesion. The level of expression of Siglec-7 on the surface of cells, e.g., T cells, can be measured using any assay, such as immunohistochemistry or flow cytometry. In the context of the determination of levels of expression of Siglec-7 on tumor-infiltrating T cells, “overexpression” of Siglec-7 is considered to be where at least 10%, at least 20%, or at least 25%, or at least 30%, or greater, of the cells being analyzed, e.g., CD8+ T cells, express detectable Siglec-7 on the cell surface. Thus, “overexpress” in this context refers to the percentage of T cells that express detectable Siglec-7. “Overexpression” in this context is synonymous with the term “elevated numbers” or “elevated levels” of T cells that express detectable Siglec-7 in referring to the percentage of T cells that express detectable Siglec-7. The level of Siglec-7 ligand expressed by a tumor is also typically evaluated. A tumor is considered to express Siglec-7 ligand when detectable binding of Siglec-7 is observed on the surface of tumor cells. In some embodiments, expression of Siglec-7 ligand on at least 10%, at least 20%, at least 30%, at least 50%, or greater of the tumor cells in a sample that is evaluated may be used as a selection criteria for determining a patient to be treated with an anti-Siglec-7 antibody.

In one aspect, methods of the disclosure comprise administering an anti-Siglec-7 antibody as a pharmaceutical composition to a cancer patient in a therapeutically effective amount using a dosing regimen suitable for treatment of the cancer. The composition can be formulated for use in a variety of drug delivery systems. One or more physiologically acceptable excipients or carriers can also be included in the compositions for proper formulation. Suitable formulations for use in the present invention are found, e.g., in Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 21st Edition, Philadelphia, Pa. Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, 2005. The anti-Siglec-7 antibody is provided in a solution suitable for administration to the patient, such as a sterile isotonic aqueous solution for injection. The antibody is dissolved or suspended at a suitable concentration in an acceptable carrier. In some embodiments the carrier is aqueous, e.g., water, saline, phosphate buffered saline, and the like. The compositions may contain auxillary pharmaceutical substances as required to approximate physiological conditions, such as pH adjusting and buffering agents, tonicity adjusting agents, and the like. The pharmaceutical compositions are administered to a patient in an amount sufficient to cure or at least partially arrest the disease or symptoms of the disease and its complications. An amount adequate to accomplish this is defined as a “therapeutically effective dose.” A therapeutically effective dose is determined by monitoring a patient's response to therapy. Typical benchmarks indicative of a therapeutically effective dose include amelioration of symptoms of the disease in the patient. Amounts effective for this use will depend upon the severity of the disease and the general state of the patient's health, including other factors such as age, weight, gender, administration route, etc. Single or multiple administrations of the antibody may be administered depending on the dosage and frequency as required and tolerated by the patient. In any event, the methods provide a sufficient quantity of anti-Siglec-7 antibody to effectively treat the patient. An anti-Siglec-7 antibody can be administered by any suitable means, including, for example, parenteral, intrapulmonary, and intranasal, administration, as well as local administration, such as intratumor administration. Parenteral infusions include intramuscular, intravenous, intraarterial, intraperitoneal, or subcutaneous administration. In some embodiments, the antibody may be administered by insufflation. In an illustrative embodiment, the antibody may be stored at 10 mg/ml in sterile isotonic aqueous saline solution for injection at 4° C. and is diluted in either 100 ml or 200 ml 0.9% sodium chloride for injection prior to administration to the patient. In some embodiments, the antibody is administered by intravenous infusion over the course of 1 hour at a dose of between 0.01 and 25 mg/kg. In other embodiments, the antibody is administered by intravenous infusion over a period of between 15 minutes and 2 hours. In still other embodiments, the administration procedure is via sub-cutaneous bolus injection. The dose of antibody is chosen in order to provide effective therapy for the patient and is in the range of less than 0.01 mg/kg body weight to about 25 mg/kg body weight or in the range 1 mg-2 g per patient. Preferably the dose is in the range 0.1-10 mg/kg or approximately 50 mg-1000 mg/patient. The dose may be repeated at an appropriate frequency which may be in the range once per day to once every three months, or every six months, depending on the pharmacokinetics of the antibody (e.g., half-life of the antibody in the circulation) and the pharmacodynamic response (e.g., the duration of the therapeutic effect of the antibody). In some embodiments, the in vivo half-life of between about 7 and about 25 days and antibody dosing is repeated between once per week and once every 3 months or once every 6 months. In other embodiments, the antibody is administered approximately once per month. An anti-Siglec-7 antibody of may be administered with one or more additional therapeutic agents, e.g., chemotherapeutic agents and/or additional immunotherapies.

In some embodiments, an anti-Siglec-7 antibody may be administered at the same time as the additional therapeutic agent. The following examples are offered for illustrative purposes, and are not intended to limit the invention. Those of skill in the art will readily recognize a variety of non-critical parameters that can be changed or modified to yield essentially the same results. EXAMPLES Example 1. Siglec-7 Detection on Tumor-Infiltrating T Cells Samples comprising cells from primary human tumor specimens were prepared using the Mylteni GentleMACS instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were analyzed by fluorescent-activated cell sorting to determine immune cell surface markers including CD3, CD8, CD16, CD45 and 7-AAD as a viability marker. CD8+ T cells were identified and gated as 7-AAD-CD45+CD3+CD8+. Anti-Siglec-7-PE (clone S7.7 Biolegend) was used to detect Siglec-7 levels. The results demonstrated that both the percentage (FIG. 4) and the level (FIG. 5) of Siglec-7 expression is enhanced on CD8+ tumor-infiltrating T cells in a subset of tumors. Example 2. Siglec-7 Ligand Detection on Tumor Cells Ligand levels on tumor cells were also evaluated. Specific binding of recombinant Siglec-7-Fc fusion protein was used to assess Siglec-7 ligand levels on cells isolated form fresh primary tumors. As a specificity control, cells were treated with sialidase/neuraminidase (Roche) at 0.1 U/mL to remove sialic acids from the cell surface. The results demonstrated that Siglec-7 ligands are detected on tumor cells from various subsets of tumors (FIG. 6). Sialidase treatment of cells (i.e. “stripping” of sialoglycans from the cell membrane) eliminated binding. Example 3. Antibodies with Improved KD  A panel of antibodies was evaluated for binding to Siglec-7. The results identified anti-Siglec-7 antibodies that have improved KD values compared to commercially available anti-Siglec-7 antibodies (FIG. 7). Example 4. Antibodies with Siglec-7 Ligand Blocking Activity Recombinant Siglec-7-Fc was added to A375 cells in the presence of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies at increasing concentrations and binding of the complex was detected on the cell surface. The results showed that anti-Siglec-7 antibodies blocked the interaction of Siglec-7 with ligands present on the surface of A375 melanoma human cells with various potencies (FIG. 8) and demonstrated antibodies that have improved ligand blocking activity relative to commercially available anti-Siglec-7 antibodies. Example 5. Antibodies with Siglec-7 Internalization Activity Primary human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were incubated with increasing concentrations of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies for 24 hours and remaining Siglec-7 in the cell surface of NK cells was detected using a non-competing anti-Siglec-7 antibody. The results showed that anti-Siglec-7 antibodies caused internalization of Siglec-7 on primary human NK cells with various potencies (FIG. 9) and demonstrated antibodies that have improved internalization activity compared to commercially available, or previously described, anti-Siglec-7 antibodies. Rapid, concentration-dependent antibody-induced internalization of Siglec-7 on human NK cells was further evaluated using monoclonal antibody 3F1. 3F1 showed more potent internalization activity compared to commercially available S7.7 antibody (FIG. 10) Evaluation of monoclonal antibody 8A2 (FIG. 11) demonstrated that the antibody did not block Siglec-7/ligand interaction (left panel), but caused internalization (right panel) of Siglec-7 on primary human immune cells. Example 6. Humanized Sequences Humanized antibodies were generated using monoclonal antibodies 16H11 and 8A2 to generate humanized internalizing anti-Siglec 7 antibodies. Humanized antibodies derived from 16H11 were evaluated for binding to Siglec 7. Antibody binding results (measured in the form of a monovalent Fab) are shown in Table 1. Antibodies having the following heavy and light chain variable regions demonstrated KD values (monovalent Fab) of about 75 nM or lower: VH438-4 and VL418-2; VH440-2 and VL418-2; VH441-2 and VL418-2; VH443-1 and VL418-2; VH444-2 and VL418-2, VH445-3 and VL418-2; VH449-4 and VL448-3; VH449-6 and VL418-2; VH387-11 and VL418-2; VH446-7 and VL418-2; VH 446-7 and VL448-3; VH463-2 and VL418-2; Vh463-2 and VL448-3; FH465-17 and VL418-2; VH484-6 and VL418-2; VH484-6 and VL448-3; and VH484-7 and VL448-3. The ligand blocking activity of the 16H11 anti-Siglec-7 antibody is preserved, as indicated by analysis of selected antibodies (indicated by the VH/VL pairs in Table 1): AK410-1/AK418-2, AK446-7/AK418-2, and AK446-7/AK448-3.

 Methods KD Measurements Antibody binding analysis was carried out by bio-layer interferometry (ForteBio). The assay was conducted at 25° C. in 1× ForteBio Kinetics buffer (ForteBio18-132) in ultrapure water. Antibodies were captured on anti-mouse kinetic sensors at 0.5 ug/mL; Siglec-7-ECD was used as analyte and diluted in assay buffer from 50 nM to 1.56 nM with 2× dilutions. Two-minute associations were conducted, followed by 10-minute dissociations. Results were determined relative to a control empty reference AHC sensor, and analyzed using ForteBio analysis software with 1:1 global fit parameters. Antibody Competition Using Fortebio Siglec-7-ECD-huFc was captured on anti-human IgG kinetic sensors at 0.5 ug/ml under saturating conditions (15 min at 1 ug/ml), after which the competing antibody was tested for binding. Each anti-Siglec-7 antibody was tested both ways (i.e. as saturating antibody and as competing antibody) against all other antibodies. When the antibody on the sensor competes with the antibody in solution, no additional binding to the antigen is observed. When a binding signal is observed, the two antibodies bind to the antigen in a non-competitive manner. Ligand Blocking Assay Human melanoma cell line A375, which expresses high level of ligands for Siglec-7, was used to determine the blocking activity of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies in a cell based assay. Two-fold serial dilutions of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies (40 nM to 40 pM) were combined with 10 nM Siglec-7-ECD-Fc in FACS buffer (PBS/2% BSA) and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. 2.5×10e4 A375 cells per well were added to round bottom 96-well tissue culture plates in FACS buffer, plates were centrifuged at 400 g for 2 min, supernatant was removed and cells were re-suspended in 100 ul of the antibody-Siglec-7 complexes. After a 1 hour incubation on ice, cells were washed twice and incubated for 30 minutes with goat anti-human F(ab′)2 fragment conjugated to AF647 (Jackson IR labs) at 1 ug/ml in FACS buffer. After two more washes, cells were fixed in PBS/2% PFA and acquired on a Novocyte flow cytometer (ACEA biosciences). IC50 values for blocking were determined based on plotting mean fluorescence in the APC channel and analysis using Prism Graphpad software. Internalization Assay Healthy donor peripheral blood mononuclear monocytes (PBMC) were used to determine internalization activity of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies. Previously cryopreserved PBMC were thawed and incubated for 90 minutes at 37° C. in complete medium (RPMI medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum). Five-fold serial dilutions of anti-Siglec-7 antibodies (100 nM-0.01 pM) were prepared in complete medium. Cells (5×10e4 per well) and antibody dilutions were combined in 96-well tissue culture plates and incubated at 37° C. for 24 hours. Cells were re-suspended in huFc block (Becton Dickinson) in FACS buffer and stained with an antibody cocktail containing CD3-FITC, CD16-PE and anti-Siglec-7 antibody 4B12-AF647 for 1 hour on ice. After two washes, cells were fixed in PBS/2% PFA and acquired on a Novocyte flow cytometer. IC50 values for internalization were determined based on plotting mean fluorescence in the APC channel on NK cells (gated as CD3-CD16+) and analysis using Prism Graphpad software. Primary Tumor Analysis Single cells from primary human tumor specimens were prepared using the Mylteni GentleMACS instrument according to the manufacturer's instructions. Cells were re-suspended in huFc block (Becton Dickinson) in FACS buffer and staining was performed using cocktails containing conjugated antibodies against immune cell surface markers, including CD3, CD8, CD16, CD45 and 7-AAD as a viability marker. CD8+ T cells were identified and gated as 7-AAD-CD45+CD3+CD8+. Anti-Siglec-7-PE (clone S7.7 Biolegend) was used to detect Siglec-7 levels. Cells were fixed in PBS/2% PFA and acquired on a Novocyte cytometer. Gating and analysis was performed using Flowjo software (Tristar). Ligand levels on tumor cells were detected using Siglec-7-ECD-Fc as described under Ligand blocking assay above. As a specificity control, cells were treated with sialidase/neuraminidase (Roche) at 0.1 U/mL to remove sialic acids from the cell surface.

No. 14/766,359, filed on Aug. 6, 2015, which is the US national stage of International Patent Application No. PCT/US2014/014938, filed on Feb. 5, 2014, which claims priority to U.S. Provisional Application No. 61/761,650, filed on Jun. 2, 2013. The contents of all prior applications are hereby incorporated by reference herein in their entirety. FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to antimicrobial peptides. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The increase of drug-resistant pathogens caused by the extensive use of traditional antibiotics is a serious concern worldwide. There is an urgent need to develop more effective treatment to overcome the drug-resistance problem. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are a new class of antibiotics with a new mode of action and remarkable therapeutic effects. In general, they contain 10-50 amino acids, with an overall positive charge and an amphipathic structure. It is well known that most AMPs can directly bind to bacteria membrane and kill them by disrupting membrane or targeting intracellular components. Most importantly, they are effective to antibiotics-resistant pathogens. This unique feature has encouraged the development of AMPs as novel antibiotics in the last few decades. Prior to the present invention, no literature has reported that peptides derived from hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) possess antimicrobial activities. Hepatitis B virus core protein (21 KDa) is essential for viral replication. It contains a capsid assembly domain at N-terminus (residue 1 to 149) and an arginine-rich domain (ARD) at C-terminus (residues 150 to 183) (Birnbaum et al. (1990) J Virol 64: 3319-3330; Nassal M (1992) J Virol 66: 4107-4116). ARD contains 16 arginines separated into four arginine-rich clusters (ARD I, II, III, IV) and has a function of binding to nucleic acids. When it binds to HBV pre-genomic RNA or polyanions, HBc can assemble into a stable capsid. In addition, ARD contains important signals for nuclear export and import of HBc core protein and particles. It was unexpectedly discovered that the growth of E. coli expressing HBc1-183 was much slower than that of E. coli expressing HBc1-149 (unpublished results). SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION In one aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising:

    
    
        (a) an effective amount of an isolated peptide, wherein the peptide comprises the arginine-rich carboxy-terminal region of hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) and exhibits an antimicrobial activity; and
        (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
    
    

 In another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising:

    
    
        (a) an effective amount of an isolated peptide comprising a fragment of HBc, the fragment comprising more than one arginine-rich domain (ARD) selected from the group consisting of (i), (ii) and (iii) as follows:
        
            (i) HBc ARD I-IV;
            (ii) HBc ARD I-III; or
            (iii) HBc ARD II-IV;

wherein the peptide exhibits an antimicrobial activity; and

        
        
        (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
    
    

 In another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of an isolated peptide, the peptide comprising an arginine-rich sequence derived from the C-terminal region of hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc), wherein the peptide is characterized by having an antimicrobial activity. Further in another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition as aforementioned for use in killing and/or inhibiting the growth and/or proliferation of a microorganism by causing the composition as aforementioned to be in contact with the microorganism. Yet in another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition as aforementioned for use in killing and/or inhibiting the growth and/or proliferation of a microorganism in a subject in need thereof, or for treating a subject afflicted with a microbial infection. The subject is afflicted with Staphylococcus aureus or K. pneumoniae infection. These and other aspects will become apparent from the following description of the preferred embodiment taken in conjunction with the following drawings, although variations and modifications therein may be affected without departing from the spirit and scope of the novel concepts of the disclosure. The accompanying drawings illustrate one or more embodiments of the invention and, together with the written description, serve to explain the principles of the invention. Wherever possible, the same reference numbers are used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like elements of an embodiment. 
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS
FIG. 1 shows amino acid sequences of various HBc ARD peptides tested for bactericidal activity. The lower panel presents various phosphorylated peptides and an R-to-A mutant peptide with a total of four Arg-to-Ala substitutions in ARD-III and ARD-IV of HBc147-183.
FIG. 2 shows killing kinetics of HBc147-183 against P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli and S. aureus. Bacteria were treated with HBc147-183 (1×MBC). The viability of bacteria was measured at indicated time points. Samples were measured in triplicates.
FIGS. 3A-G show localization of FITC-HBc147-183 peptide on bacteria. Approximate 107 CFU of P. aeruginosa ATCC9027, ATCC27853 (3A and 3B), K. pneumoniae ATCC13884 (3C), E. coli ATCC25922 (3D), and S. aureus ATCC19636, ATCC25923 and ATCC 29213 (3E, 3F and 3G) were incubated with HBc147-183 (0.5×MBC) for 1 hour. The bacteria were washed, fixed and stained with DAPI (blue). Images were taken using confocal microscopy.
FIGS. 4A-C show possible bactericidal mechanisms of HBc147-183. (4A) SYTOX Green uptake of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and S. aureus by HBc147-183. Measurements of the fluorescence were recorded every minute. (4B) Dose-dependent curves of membrane permeabilization of P. aeruginosa by HBc147-183 and HBc153-176 at 0.5, 1 and 2 μM. Two μM melittin was used as a positive control. Samples were measured in triplicates. (4C) DNA-binding activity of HBc147-183. HBc147-183 was mixed with pSUPER plasmid DNA at indicated N/P ratio for 30 minutes. The mobility of DNA was determined by a gel retardation assay.
FIG. 5 shows dose response effects of LPS and LPS antibody on the bactericidal activity of HBc147-183. LPS from P. aeruginosa and E. coli, and LPS antibody were mixed with P. aeruginosa and HBc147-183 (1×MBC) for 3 hours. The bacteria were then plated on MH agar for the measurement of viability. Samples were measured in triplicates.
FIGS. 6A-E show the ARD peptide HBc147-183 being capable of binding to LPS and Lipid A in several different in vitro binding assays. Samples were measured in triplicates in each assay. (6A) The cartoon illustrates the in vitro assays of peptide-LPS and peptide-Lipid A binding as well as LPS/Lipid A competition. (6B) Constant amount of LPS was incubated with increasing concentrations of biotinylated ARD HBc 147-183 peptide on the streptavidine-conjugated beads (0, 0.004, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 μM). Unbound LPS in the supernatant was measured with the LAL ELISA assay. The EU values were normalized with a control without peptide treatment. HBc147-183 8p (containing 8 phosphorylated amino acids) was also included as a control peptide due to its poor binding with LPS. (6C) Beads-bound LPS was released into the supernatant by overnight digestion with trypsin agarose. Free LPS in the supernatant was analyzed with the LAL ELISA assay. Released LPS in the supernatant appeared to be in proportion to the amount of ARD peptide HBc147-183 on the beads. (6D) Constant amount of Lipid A was incubated with increasing concentrations of HBc147-183 and HBc147-183 8P, respectively. The supernatant was also detected with LAL ELISA reagent. The result here is consistent with the notion that Lipid A can bind to HBc147-183 directly. (6E) LPS/Lipid A competition assay. Constant amount of LPS (1 μg) was coated on each well on the ELISA plate, and then incubated with a reaction mixture containing constant amount of 10 nM HBc147-183 and increasing concentrations of Lipid A. The gradual increase of Lipid A reduced the amount of plate-bound ARD peptide HBc147-183 in a dose dependent manner.
FIGS. 7A-D shows cytotoxicity assays of ARD peptide HBc147-183. (7A) Hemolytic activities of HBc147-183 and melittin were measured with 10% human red blood cells (RBC). Compared to melittin, HBc147-183 showed no hemolytic activity. (7B) Huh7, HepG2, Vero and HEK293 cells were incubated with varying concentrations (0 to 100μM) of HBc147-183 and melittin for 1 hour at 37° C. The effects on cell viability were determined by MTT assay. Melittin was used as a positive control. HBc147-183 showed no detectable effect on cell viability, while melittin exhibited strong toxicity. (7C) Kidney cells, Vero and HEK293 were stained with CFSE and seeded at day 0. At day 1, cells were incubated with varying concentrations (0 to 100 μM) of HBc147-183 for 1 hour. Cell proliferation at day 1 and day 3 were determined by flow cytometry. Similar to the mock control experiment, no significant effect on Vero and HEK293 cells was detected. Samples assayed in FIGS. 7A-C were measured in triplicates. (7D) In vivo toxicity of ARD peptide HBc147-183 was determined using three-week old male ICR mice. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with peptide (10 and 20 mg/kg of body weight). All mice were alive after 7 days.
FIGS. 8A-D show in vivo studies of the protection activity of ARD peptide HBc147-183 against S. aureus. (8A) Three-week old male ICR mice were challenged with a lethal dose of S. aureus ATCC 19636 and then divided into five separate groups for five different time points. At each indicated time point (n=5), blood samples were collected, diluted and plated on BHI agar. The number of bacteria was counted the following day. A maximal bacterial load in the blood was observed at 2 h post-inoculation. The data were shown in mean 6 SD. (8B) ICR mice inoculated with a lethal dose of S. aureus as described above were treated by intraperitoneal injection with ARD peptide (10 mg/kg) at 1, 1.5 or 2 h post-inoculation, respectively. Each group contained 10 mice. All mice (100%) treated with the PBS control died at day 1, while treatment of ARD peptide at 1, 1.5 or 2 h post-inoculation protected the mice with survival rates of 100%, 70% and 40% after 7 days, respectively. (8C) As described above, ICR mice were i.p. inoculated with S. aureus, followed by i.p. injection with PBS (n=5) or 10 mg/kg ARD peptide (n=5) at 1 h post-inoculation. At 4 h post-inoculation, blood, liver and spleen were collected. Liver and spleen samples were homogenized, diluted and, together with blood samples, plated on BHI agar. The number of bacteria was counted the following day. In comparison to mice treated with PBS, treatment of ARD peptide effectively reduced the bacterial load in blood, liver and spleen. (8D) Quantitative comparison of bacterial loads in blood, liver and spleen samples of mice treated with PBS (open circle, diamond and square) versus ARD peptide HBc147-183 (solid circle, diamond and square). The line indicated the mean of bacterial load. **P,0.01 (Mann-Whitney U test) for PBS and ARD peptide HBc147-183.
FIGS. 9A-B shows an IVIS analysis of in vivo antimicrobial activity of ARD peptide against K. pneumoniae. (9A) K. pneumoniae-infected mice were treated with either PBS (n=5) or 10 mg/kg ARD peptide (n=5) at 1 hour post-inoculation. Four hours post-inoculation, mice were anesthetized and imaged. Bacterial load was displayed in the photographic image with an overlay of bioluminescence. False color imaging represents intense luminescence in red, moderate luminescence in green and low luminescence in blue and purple. (9B) Total flux was quantified by IVIS imaging software. **P,0.01 (Mann-Whitney U test) for PBS and ARD peptide HBc147-183.
FIG. 10 is a table showing antimicrobial activity of HBC ARD peptides.
FIG. 11 is a table showing antimicrobial activity of ARD peptide HBc147-183 against colistin-resistant and sensitive P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. 
FIG. 12 shows sequence alignments of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein (HBc) arginine rich domain (ARD). HBc ARD domain is highly conserved among different serotypes isolated from patients of different geographic areas.
FIGS. 13A-B show sequence alignments of HBc ARD domains of hepadnaviruses from primate, rodent and avian origins. HBc ARD sequences are highly conserved among human, wooly monkey, ground squirrel, woodchuck, and bat. The arginine (positive charge) clustering subdomains at HBc ARD are designated as ARD-I, ARD-II, ARD-III, and ARD-IV. FIG. 13 B further shows that there are also four clustering positive charge amino acids in the core protein C-terminus of duck, heron, parrot, Ross's goose and snow goose hepatitis B virus. Despite the sequence divergence and evolutionary distance between the primate, rodent, and avian hepadnaviruses, it is contemplated that these positive charge-rich domain at the C-terminus of core protein from rodent (13A) and avian (13B) hepadnaviruses could also contain antimicrobial activities (cf Table 1).

Certain terms that are used to describe the invention are discussed below, or elsewhere in the specification, to provide additional guidance to the practitioner regarding the description of the invention. For convenience, certain terms may be highlighted, for example using italics and/or quotation marks. The use of highlighting has no influence on the scope and meaning of a term; the scope and meaning of a term is the same, in the same context, whether or not it is highlighted. It will be appreciated that same thing can be said in more than one way. Consequently, alternative language and synonyms may be used for any one or more of the terms discussed herein, nor is any special significance to be placed upon whether or not a term is elaborated or discussed herein. Synonyms for certain terms are provided. A recital of one or more synonyms does not exclude the use of other synonyms. The use of examples anywhere in this specification including examples of any terms discussed herein is illustrative only, and in no way limits the scope and meaning of the invention or of any exemplified term. Likewise, the invention is not limited to various embodiments given in this specification. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains. In the case of conflict, the present document, including definitions will control. As used herein, “around”, “about” or “approximately” shall generally mean within 20 percent, preferably within 10 percent, and more preferably within 5 percent of a given value or range. Numerical quantities given herein are approximate, meaning that the term “around”, “about” or “approximately” can be inferred if not expressly stated. Antimicrobial activity refers to the activity to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and/or protozoans. As used herein, the term “the arginine-rich carboxy-terminal region of hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc)” refers to a highly conserved arginine-rich C-terminal region of HBc (FIGS. 12 and 13A-B) and is characterized by having an antimicrobial activity. It is contemplated that the arginine-rich carboxy-terminal regions from avian and/or rodent hepadnaviruses share the same antimicrobial activities. The C-terminal end of HBc contains four arginine-rich clusters designated as ARD I-IV. Each arginine-rich cluster or domain (ARD) contains 2 or more arginine residues in continuity or in close proximity (e.g., being separated by one or two different amino acid residues). In one embodiment, each ARD may contain 2,3 or 4 continuous arginine residues. As used herein, “an amino acid sequence derived from HBc” refers to “an amino acid sequence originates from hepatitis B virus core protein and possess an antimicrobial activity”. It may be a fragment of HBc, with or without a modification, which contains ARD and possess an antimicrobial activity. A fragment of HBc with a modification includes, but not limited to PEGylation at either N- or C-terminus. The term “two clusters” and “two repeats” are interchangeable. The term “two clusters of SPRRRR” means “2 repeats of SPRRRR”, or “2 SPRRRR”. The term “amphipathic structure” refers to a molecule having hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. The HBV is divided into four major serotypes (adr, adw, ayr, ayw) based on antigenic epitopes present on its envelope proteins. The term “serotype” or “serovar” refers to distinct variations within a species of bacteria or viruses or among immune cells of different individuals. The term “protecting group” refers to a functional group that is attached to a therapeutic protein or peptide to prolong its circulatory time. A protecting group includes, but not limited to, a polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEGylation can also provide water solubility to hydrophobic proteins or peptides. The term “treating” or “treatment” refers to administration of an effective amount of a therapeutic agent to a subject in need thereof with the purpose of cure, alleviate, relieve, remedy, ameliorate, or prevent the disease, the symptoms of it, or the predisposition towards it. Such a subject can be identified by a health care professional based on results from any suitable diagnostic method. “An effective amount” refers to the amount of an active agent that is required to confer a therapeutic effect on the treated subject. Effective doses will vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on routes of administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatment. The “Guidance for Industry and Reviewers Estimating the Safe Starting Dose in Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers” published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration discloses “a human equivalent dose” may be obtained by calculations from the following formula: 

HED=animal dose in mg/kg×(animal weight in kg/human weight in kg)0.33.
 For example for i.p. administration, if a mouse (20 gram BW) dose is 10 mg/kg, then an human dose may be calculated as 10 mg/kg×(0.02/patient's body weight)0.33. A human equivalent effective dose, however, may vary, depending on other factors such as the route of administration. It was an unexpected discovery and unsolved mystery that the growth of E. coli expressing HBc1-183 was very poor and much slower than that of E. coli expressing HBc1-149. It appeared that it was HBc 150-183 that somehow retarded the growth of E. coli, and reduced HBc 1-183 protein yield dramatically. Here, we disclose the in vitro antimicrobial activities of HBc147-183 against a wide variety of bacteria, including multidrug resistant (MDR) and colistin (polymyxin E)-resistant A baumannii. The antimicrobial peptides from HBV core protein (HBc) arginine-rich domain (ARD) are mainly composed of SPRRR repeats and are effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as fungi. Using a peritoneal sepsis mouse model, it was demonstrated further that ARD peptides can effectively protect all the mice challenged with a lethal dose of Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of ARD peptides also caused significant reduction of bacterial load of S. aureus and K. pneumoniae in infected mice. Potential mechanisms for the bactericidal activity were investigated. The ARD peptides appeared to be capable of direct binding to the Lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in several different binding assays. In summary, with high antimicrobial activity and very low toxicity against human cells and animal models, these HBc ARD peptides may have a therapeutic potential in the future (Chen et al. “Identification of a Novel Antimicrobial Peptides from Human Hepatitis B Virus Core Protein Arginine-Rich Domain (ARD)” PLoS Pathog 9(6): e1003425, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In one aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising:

    
    
        (a) an effective amount of an isolated peptide, wherein the peptide comprises the arginine-rich carboxy-terminal region of hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) and exhibits an antimicrobial activity; and

            (iii) HBc ARD II-IV;

wherein the peptide exhibits an antimicrobial activity; and

        
        
        (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
    
    

 The HBc may be selected from the group consisting of a mammalian HBc and an avian HBc.

MATERIALS AND METHODS All animal experiments were conducted under protocols approved by Academia Sinica Institutional Animal Care & Utilization Committee (ASIACUC permit number 12-02-322). Research was conducted in compliance with the principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 1996. Bacterial Isolates The antimicrobial activities of HBc ARD peptides were tested on numerous bacterial strains from ATCC, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa Migula strain (ATCC 27853, ampicillin-resistant), Pseudomonas aeruginosa Migula strain (ATCC 9027, ampicillin-resistant), Klebsiella pneumoniae strain (ATCC 17593), Escherichia coli strain (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus subsp. strain (ATCC 25923, methicillin-resistant), Staphylococcus aureus subsp. strain (ATCC 29213, methicillin-resistant), Staphylococcus aureus subsp. strain (ATCC 19636, methicillinresistant), and Candida albicans strain (ATCC 10231). Clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NHRI-01, NHRI-02 AND NHRI-04) were obtained through the program of Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance, National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan. Acinetobacter baumannii (ATCC 17989, ATCC 17978 CR, ATCC19606, ATCC 19606 CR, TCGH 45530 AND TCGH 46709) were obtained from Tzu-Chi Buddhist General Hospital in Taiwan, and clinical isolates (TCGH 45530 AND TCGH 46709) were identified using the Vitek system (Biomerieux Vitek, Inc., MO, USA). A. baumannii is defined as multidrug-resistant when the organism is resistant to piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin/sulbactam, imipenem, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole. Susceptibility to colistin was determined using the broth-dilution method, in accordance with the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Antimicrobial Activity All peptides were purchased from Yao-Hong Biotechnology Inc. (Taipei, Taiwan). Vendors provided data of peptide characterizations, including HPLC and Mass. Antimicrobial activity was determined as described with some modifications as detailed below. Bacteria were grown overnight in Mueller-Hinton broth (Difco) at 37° C., and during the mid-logarithmic phase, bacteria were diluted to 106 CFU (colony formation unit)/m1 in phosphate buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.2). Peptides were serially diluted in the same buffer. Fifty microliter (μl) of bacteria was mixed with fifty μl of peptides at varying concentrations followed by incubation at 37° C. for 3 hours without shaking. At the end of incubation, bacteria were placed on Mueller-Hinton broth agar plates, and allowed growth at 37° C. overnight for measurement of minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). The lowest peptide concentration on the agar plate, which displayed no bacterial growth (zero colony), was defined as MBC. All peptides were tested in triplicate. For measurement of killing kinetics, bacteria and peptides were prepared as described above. Fifty μl of bacteria were mixed with fifty pl of peptides at the concentrations corresponding to MBC and were incubated at 37° C. At the indicated time, bacteria were serially diluted and placed on Mueller-Hinton broth agar plates for viability measurement. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy The localization of peptide was monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Bacteria were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and collected by centrifugation. Approximate 107 CFU were resuspended in a phosphate buffer containing FITC-labeled HBc147-183 at a concentration corresponding to 0.5×MBC. Following incubation for 1 hour at 37° C., cells were washed, fixed, and immobilized on poly-L-lysine coated glass slides. ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) was added to the slides prior to mounting. Localization of labeled-peptide was observed using an Olympus Ultraview confocal microscopy equipped with a 100× oil immersion lens. SYTOX Green Uptake Briefly, bacteria (107 CFU) were prepared and mixed with 1 μM SYTOX Green (Invitrogen) for 15 minutes in the dark. After the addition of peptides to the final concentrations corresponding to their respective MBC, fluorescence intensity was measured at 37° C. using wavelengths 485 nm and 520 nm filters for excitation and emission. Melittin (Sigma), a major toxin of bee venom, was used as a positive control to provide maximal permeabilization. Gel Retardation Assay The proportion between amino nitrogen (NH3+) of HBc147-183 and phosphate (PO4−) of DNA was defined as N/P ratio. Briefly, HBc147-183 was incubated with pSUPER plasmid DNA at different N/P ratio (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3 and 4) for 30 minutes at 37° C. The mobility of pSUPER plasmid DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. In Vitro Binding Assay Between ARD Peptides and LPS/Lipida Several kinds of peptide-LPS or peptide-Lipid A binding assays were performed as follows:

    
    
        1) Streptavidine-conjugated beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1, Invitrogen) were blocked by P. aeruginosa LPS (Sigma) at 37° C. for 1.5 hour. After washing with PBST (PBS, pH 7.4 containing 0.1% (w/v) Tween-20), aliquots containing 250 pmol streptavidine-conjugated beads were incubated with a reaction mixture overnight at 4° C. The reaction mixture was prepared by mixing increasing amounts of biotinylated peptide HBc147-183 (0, 0.004, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 μM) and 5 μg/ml P. aeruginosa LPS (Sigma) or 200 μg/ml E. coli lipid A (Sigma), at 37° C. for 3 hour. After incubation overnight at 4° C., the reduction of LPS (or Lipid A) in the supernatants were measured by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test (Charles River Endosafe) with an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices). The amount (EU/ml) of LPS was calculated according to the standard curve prepared with Endosafe Control Srandard Endotoxin.
        2) To directly measure the increasing amounts of LPS bound to the increasing amounts of peptide HBc147-183 on the peptide-coated beads, the beads were then washed with PBST three times and incubated with 100 μl of PBS containing 0.15 units of trypsin agarose (Sigma) for overnight digestion at 37° C. After trypsinization, the trypsin-released LPS in the supernatants were collected and measured by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test. Similar results were obtained by another LPS testing method: Endosafe-PST Cartridges (Charles River Laboratories).
        3) To perform the LPS/Lipid A competition assay, one μg of LPS was coated on High Binding ELISA plates (Corning) overnight at 4° C. The LPS-coated plates were washed by PBST and then blocked with PBST containing 5% BSA for 1 hour at 37° C. After washing, HBc147-183 (10 nM), mixed with varying concentrations of E. coli Lipid A (0 to 10m/ml), were added into each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. Plate-bound HBc147-183 was measured by streptavidin conjugated with HRP (1:10000 dilution) for 1 hour at 37° C. TMB substrates were added into each well for color development. The absorption was measured at 450 nm with a reference wavelength at 655 nm.
    
    

 Hemolytic Activity The hemolytic activities of peptides were determined by hemolysis against human red blood cells (hRBCs). Human blood was obtained in EDTA-containing tube and was centrifuged at 450 g for 10 min. The pellet was washed three times with PBS buffer, and a solution of 10% hRBCs was prepared. hRBCs solution was mixed with serial dilutions of peptides in PBS buffer, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37° C. After centrifugation at 450 g for 10 min, the percentage of hemolysis was determined by measuring the absorbance at the wavelength of 405 nm of the supernatant. Blank and 100% hemolysis were determined in PBS buffer and in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, respectively. Cytotoxicity Cytotoxicity was measured in HepG2, Huh7, HEK293, and Vero cells by MTT assay. Cells were seeded at 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate and serial dilutions of peptides were added into each well. PBS was used as a negative control and melittin was used as a positive control. After 1 hour of incubation, the medium were replaced by a fresh medium containing 10% MTT solution (PROMEGA™), and the plate was incubated for 4 hours in 5% CO2 at 37° C. The absorbance at the wavelength of 595 nm was measured by an ELISA reader (BIO-RAD™ model 680). CFSE Cell Proliferation Assay To set up CFSE cell proliferation assay, 293 cells (human kidney origin) and Vero cells (monkey kidney origin) were resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 106 cells/ml before incubation with 10 μM CFSE dye (CELLTRACE™ CFSE cell proliferation kit, INVITROGEN™) at 37° C. for 10 min. To quench the staining, ice-old culture media were then added and incubated on ice for 5 min. Labeled cells were then pelleted and washed three times with a fresh medium containing 10% FBS before seeding into six well plates at a density of 3.3×105cells/well. After 20 h, the medium was removed and incubated with a fresh medium containing 5, 25 and 100 μM HBc 147-183 for one hour (FITC-labeled ARD peptide had been largely internalized in 10 minutes after the addition of ARD peptides to the medium of HepG2 cells). Forty-eight hours later, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCanto, BD Bioscience). In Vivo Animal Studies Three-week old male ICR mice (19 to 21 g) were purchased from BioLASCO (Taiwan). Overnight culture of bacteria in BHI broth (Difco) was subcultured in fresh BHI broth to log phase. Inoculums were diluted in BHI broth to indicated densities. To test the acute toxicity of ARD peptide in vivo, ICR male mice were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10 and 20 mg/kg HBc147-183 in PBS, respectively. Each group contained 5 mice. After peptide injection, the number of dead mice was recorded daily for 7 days post-injection. To test the antimicrobial activity of the ARD peptide in vivo, all mice were inoculated i.p. with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19636 (4×106 CFU/mouse) in BHI broth. Peptide HBc147-183 (10 mg/kg) was administered i.p. at 1, 1.5 and 2 hours post-inoculation. PBS (10 ml/kg) control was administered at 1 hour post-inoculation. Each group contained 10 mice. Mortality was monitored daily for 7 days post-inoculation. In a separate experiment to measure the bacterial load, mice were inoculated i.p. with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19636 (106 CFU/mouse) in BHI broth. All mice were administered at 1 hour post-inoculation with peptide HBc147-183 (10 mg/kg) or PBS (10 ml/kg) control, and sacrificed at 4 hours post-inoculation. Blood samples (200 μl) were mixed with 100 mM EDTA (10 μl) and were diluted 20-fold in PBS (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free). Liver and spleen samples (0.1 g) were homogenized in sterile PBS (500 μl). Samples were diluted approximately 100-fold and plated on BHI agar for scoring the colony numbers. To test the in vivo antimicrobial activity of the ARD peptide against Gram-negative bacteria, mice were inoculated with Klebsiella pneumoniae Xen39 (107 cfu/mouse) (Caliper LifeSciences), an engineered strain containing a modified Photorhabdus luminescens luxABCDE operon. One hour post-inoculation, mice received either 10 ml/kg PBS (n=5) or 10 mg/kg ARD peptide (n=5), respectively. In vivo imaging was carried out at 4 hours post-inoculation. The mice were anesthetized first before transferring to the IVIS imaging system (IVIS spectrum), and luminescence was measured with an exposure time of 1 minutes or less. The image system measured the number of photons and translated the data to false color images that depicted the region of strong luminescence with red, moderate luminescence with yellow and green, and mild luminescence with blue. Decreasing bioluminescence indicated reduction of bacteria. The images were overlay of photographic images and bioluminescence using a computer-generated color scale. Total flux (RLU) of region of interest (ROI) was quantified by the IVIS imaging software. RESULTS In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity of HBc Peptides As shown in FIGS. 1 and 10, HBc147-183 displayed a broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. coli), Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus), and fungi (C. albicans). Among these tested strains, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumonia were the most sensitive to this peptide. The MBCs of HBc147-183 were lower than 4 μM for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumonia, and around 4 μM for E. coli, and S. aureus. C. albicans was the least sensitive to this peptide (MBC ˜8 μM). To further map the active sequences of the antimicrobial activity, various peptides (FIG. 1) in different length were synthesized and tested as before. Peptide HBc147-175, with the deletion of the last eight amino acids at the C-terminus, maintained strong activity against Gram-negative bacteria, albeit it lost the activity against S. aureus and C. albicans. We detected no activity against all of the tested bacteria and fungi from peptides ARD I-II (HBc147-159) or ARD III-IV (HBc164-176 and HBc162-175). In contrast, all peptides containing ARD II-IV (HBc153-176, HBc157-176, HBc153-175, HBc155-175, and HBc157-175) and ARD I-III (HBc147-167) exhibited strong activity against P. aeruginosa and K. pneumonia, respectively, albeit they were weak against E. coli (FIG. 10). Therefore, peptide ARD II-IV and ARD I-III appeared to be necessary and sufficient for the bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa and K. pneumonia.  Positive Charge of ARD Peptides is Critical to the Bactericidal Activity Phophorylation studies on serine residues S155, S162, S170, S176 and S181 revealed that serine phosphorylation in general weakened the potency of antimicrobial activity. It was found that all HBc peptides, once phosphorylated, lost their activities against C. albicans (FIG. 11). For bacteria, the phosphorylation on S181 showed no effects, whereas phosphorylations on S155, S162, S170, and S176 reduced the antimicrobial activity. The MBCs dropped to 8 μM for HBc155p and HBc176p, and 32 μM for HBc162p and HBc170p, respectively. When S155, S162 and S170 were simultaneously phosphorylated (HBc155p162p170p), the antimicrobial activity was completely lost (>32 μM). The results suggested that, except for S181, serine phosphorylation is generally detrimental to the antimicrobial activity of HBc ARD peptide. To confirm the importance of arginine residues for bactericidal activity, we synthesized and tested peptide HBc147-183-III-IV AA, which has two R-to-A substitution mutations in each of ARD III and ARD IV. Similar to phosphorylated HBc ARD peptides, the MBC of HBc147-183-III-IV AA was significantly increased compared to HBc147-183. The result indicated that arginine residues are required for the antimicrobial activity. Drug Resistance The antimicrobial activity of HBc147-183 against colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was tested. As shown in FIG. 11, while HBc147-183 killed colistin-sensitive P. aeruginosa at 4 μM, colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa were cross-resistant to HBc147-183 (MBC>16 μM). In contrast to P. aeruginosa, the MBCs of HBc147-183 against colistin-sensitive and colistin-resistant A. baumannii are in a similar range of 0.5-1 μM. This result indicates that, for colistin-resistant A. baumannii, there is no cross-resistance to our ARD peptide HBc147-183. Killing Kinetics Time course of bacterial viability was determined after the tested bacteria (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, E. coli and S. aureus) were treated with HBc147-183 at the concentrations corresponding to the MBC (FIG. 2). The results showed that P. aeruginosa was immediately killed within 20 minutes upon the addition of HBc147-183 (2 μM). Although K. pneumonia and E. coli were members of Gram-negative bacteria, they were killed by 4 μM HBc147-183 in 180 minutes. For S. aureus, complete killing by 4 μM HBc147-183 was observed in 120 minutes. Localization and Mechanism of HBc147-183 P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus were treated with FITC-labeled HBc147-183 corresponding to 0.5×MBC, and the localization of HBc147-183 was visualized using confocal fluorescence microscopy (FIG. 3). The results showed that, upon peptide treatment, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E. coli appeared as hollow rods with fluorescence clearly defined bacteria surface, suggesting that HBc147-183 was accumulated on the membrane (FIGS. 3A-D). To understand better the effect of HBc peptides on the membranes, SYTOX Green uptake assay was performed. A significant degree of membrane permeabilization was induced on P. aeruginosa upon the addition of 2 μM HBc147-183 (FIG. 4A). Although it was also accumulated on the membrane of K. pneumonia and E. coli, 4 μM HBc147-183 was not able to induce membrane permeabilization as observed on S. aureus. Consistent with the bactericidal activity of HBc147-183 against P. aeruginosa, HBc153-176 caused same membrane permeabilization within 10 minutes in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 4B). This indicated that the bactericidal effect of HBc peptides on P. aeruginosa is directly through the membrane permeabilization with a fast kinetics similar to that of killing kinetics (FIG. 2). On the other hand, HBc147-183 was found to penetrate through the membrane of S. aureus and localized in the cytoplasm (FIGS. 3E-G). To investigate the potential interaction between HBc 147-183 and DNA, HBc147-183 was mixed with pSUPER plasmid DNA at different N/P ratio (Materials and Methods) and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (FIG. 4C). The results showed that the mobility of DNA was decreased when the ratio of peptide/DNA increased and the plasmid DNA was completely retarded at the ratio of 1, suggesting that HBc147-183 has a strong binding activity to plasmid DNA. Overall, it suggests that the bactericidal mechanisms of HBc147-183 on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria may be completely different. Direct Binding of HBc147-183 to LPS To determine whether LPS of Gram-negative bacteria could serve as a potential target of HBc147-183, LPS (0.05 to 50 μg/ml) from either P. aeruginosa or E. coli (Sigma) were incubated with both P. aeruginosa and 2 μM HBc147-183 for three hours, respectively. The results showed that the bactericidal activity of HBc147-183 was significantly reduced by addition of either LPS at the concentration of 50 μg/ml (FIG. 5). In addition, HBc147-183 preferentially bound to the LPS from P. aeruginosa, rather than that from E. coli. However, the addition of anti-LPS antibody (Genetex Co.) cannot sufficiently neutralize the bactericidal activity of HBc147-183 (FIG. 5). It suggests that HBc147-183 could bind to not only LPS but also other target molecules on the membrane. Alternatively, HBc147-183 and the anti-LPS polyclonal antibody used here could bind predominantly to two different epitopes on the LPS. As shown in FIG. 6A, the potential interaction between HBc147-183 and LPS (or Lipid A moiety) in vitro was investigated using several different binding assays. In FIG. 6B, when increasing amount of HBc147-183 was bound to the strepavidine-conjugated Dynabeads and allowed incubation with a constant amount of LPS, gradually increasing amount of LPS appeared to be depleted from the supernatant. HBc147-183 8p, which has eight ser/thr phosphorylations, was used in parallel as a control peptide. Similar results were obtained by another LPS testing method: Endosafe-PTS Cartridges (Charles River Laboratories). In FIG. 6C, the beads-captured LPS were dissociated from the beads by trypsin agarose digestion of the ARD peptide HBc147-183. The amount of released LPS was measured by the LAL test (Materials and Methods). LPS contains mainly the polysaccharide and Lipid A moieties. To determine whether the ARD peptide can bind to Lipid A directly, we tested in FIG. 6D the binding between Lipid A and the ARD peptide in a manner similar to FIG. 6B. As expected, increasing amounts of HBc147-183 on the beads led to decreasing amounts of Lipid A remaining in the supernatant. The inverse correlation between the ARD peptide on the beads and the Lipid A in the supernatant (FIG. 6D) is strikingly similar to what was observed previously between the ARD peptide HBc147-183 on the beads and LPS in the supernatant (FIG. 6B). To directly demonstrate that the ARD peptide can bind to the Lipid A moiety of LPS, we performed a competition experiment between Lipid A and LPS (FIG. 6E). The LPS-coated ELISA plates were incubated with constant amount of HBc147-183 (10 nM), which was premixed with varying concentrations of E. coli Lipid A (0 to 10 μg/ml). After extensive washing, plate-bound (i.e., LPS-bound) biotinylated peptide HBc147-183 was measured by streptavidin conjugated with HRP, followed by adding TMB substrates and color development. The binding of HBc147-183 to LPS was significantly decreased by the increasing concentrations of Lipid A (FIG. 6E). The result here lends support for the notion that Lipid A moiety of LPS can serve as a direct target for ARD peptide HBc147-183. Cytocoxicity To determine the cytotoxicity of HBc peptides, we measured the hemolytic activity of HBc147-183. Compared to the melittin control, no detectable hemolysis by HBc147-183 was observed after one hour of incubation (FIG. 7A). In addition, MTT assay was performed to determine the cytotoxicity of HBc147-183 to human hepatoma (Huh 7 and HepG2 cells) and kidney cells (Vero and HEK293 cells). The viability of cells treated with melittin at low dose (3.125 μM) was significantly decreased. In contrast, HBc147-183 caused only a low level of cytotoxicity at the concentration of 100 μM (FIG. 7B). The CFSE cell proliferation assay was also performed to determine the effect of HBc147-183 on the proliferation of Vero and HEK293 kidney cells. In comparison to day 1, CFSE intensity of cells treated with HBc147-183 (5, 25 and 100 μM) decreased to the same level as the mock control on day 3 (FIG. 7C), suggesting that ARD peptide HBc147-183 has no significant effect on cell proliferation. Animal Model To conduct the experimental infection with bacteria, we i.p. inoculated mice with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19636 (4×106 cfu/mouse). Bacterial load in blood at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-inoculation was determined. As shown in FIG. 8A, bacteria rapidly transferred to the blood compartment from peritoneal cavity. Within 2 hours, the number of bacteria in the blood achieved the maximum (106 cfu/ml). Thereafter, the number of bacteria in the blood gradually decreased spontaneously. To distinguish the ARD peptide-mediated from the spontaneous clearance, we therefore tested the in vivo protection activity of the ARD peptide within 2 hours post-inoculation. Briefly, mice were i.p. inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19636 and received a single dose of 10 ml/kg PBS or a single dose of 10 mg/kg ARD peptide at 1, 1.5, 2 hours post-inoculation, respectively. Mice (n=10) treated with PBS died within 24 hours post-inoculation (FIG. 8B). In contrast, administration of ARD peptide (10 mg/kg) at 1 hour post-inoculation can effectively protect all mice (n=10) from death at day 7. When we administered ARD peptide at 1.5 (n=10) and 2 (n=10) hours post- inoculation, survival rates were decreased to 70% and 40%, respectively. Instead of using death as a surrogate indicator of the antimicrobial activity of ARD peptide, we also determined directly the in vivo effect of ARD peptide on bacterial load of infected mice (FIG. 8C). Mice were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus as before and treated with 10 ml/kg PBS (n=5) or 10 mg/kg ARD peptide (n=5) at 1 hour post-inoculation. Four hours post-inoculation, bacterial load in blood, liver and spleen samples of control mice were in the range of 106 cfu/ml (FIGS. 8C and 8D). Administration of ARD peptide significantly reduced the bacterial load (˜104 cfu/ml) by 100-fold in blood, liver and spleen than the PBS control mice (P<0.01). In addition to Staphylococcus aureus, we also examined the in vivo antimicrobial activity of ARD peptide on K. pneumoniae using an IVIS imaging system. Similar to the change in bacterial load of S. aureus, bioluminescence of mice inoculated with K. pneumoniae Xen39 peaked at 2 hour post-inoculation (data not shown). We then treated K. pneumoniae Xen39-infected mice with PBS or ARD peptide at 1 hour post-inoculation, respectively. The results showed that the bioluminescence of ARD peptide-treated mice was very weak, whereas PBS control showed a more extensive bioluminescence (FIG. 9A). There was a significant difference in the overall RLU values of mice treated with PBS versus ARD peptide (P<0.01) (FIG. 9B). Taken together, the results indicated that HBc147-183 exhibited significant antimicrobial activity in vivo. Table 1 shows comparison of minimal bactericidal concentrations of human HBc ARD and woodchuck HBc ARD against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

 The invention relates to a novel antimicrobial peptide (HBc147-183) isolated from the C-terminal domain of HBc. The computer program based on the antimicrobial peptide database (Wang et al. (2004) Nucleic Acids Res 32: D590-592) predicted unfavorably that HBc147-183 could serve as an antibacterial peptide, due to its very low content of hydrophobic amino acids. Contrary to the computer prediction, surprisingly, HBc147-183 exhibited a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. While colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa exhibited cross-resistance to ARD peptide HBc147-183, we found a strong activity of hbc147-183 (MBC=0.5-1 μm) against all tested colistin-resistant A. baumannii. Our ARD peptide could bind to Lipid A of E. coli and LPS of P. aeruginosa (FIG. 6). While only the full-length HBc147-183 (ARD I-IV) was effective against the tested gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus, ARD II-IV (HBc153-176) and ARD I-III (HBc147-167), in a less than full-length context, exhibited strong activity against gram-negative P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, respectively (but not E. coli). Comparisons with Other AMPs It is surprising that the ARD domain of HBc protein (HBc147-183) exhibits novel and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. This peptide shares some degree of similarity with several antimicrobial peptides in literature, such as protamine (PRRRRSSSRPVRRRRRPRVSRRRRRRGGRRRR; SEQ ID NO: 11) and drosocin (GKPRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV; SEQ ID NO: 12). A radial diffusion assay showed that a single arginine-rich domain (RRRR) is sufficient for antimicrobial activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria (Lesmes et al. (2009) Peptides 30: 2150-2160). Unlike protamine, the arginine-rich domain of HBc147-183, such as ARD I-II and ARD III-IV, were not sufficient for the antimicrobial activity. In addition, sequence alignment by anitimicrobial peptide database revealed that HBc153-176 shares 44% amino acid sequence homology with Drosocin, which is a proline-rich peptide isolated from Drosophila. However, except for P. aeruginosa, Drosocin is predominately active against most Gram-negative bacteria. Drosocin kills bacteria via an apparently non-membranolytic mechanism. The HBc ARD is a novel peptide with a broad spectrum bactericidal activity quite distinct from other known arginine-rich antimicrobial peptides. Protamine contains RRGGRRRR (SEQ ID NO: 17), while HBc147-183 contains SQSRESQC (SEQ ID NO: 16) at the C-terminus of HBc. Bactericidal Mechanisms The results showed the membrane localization of HBc147-183 on Gram-negative bacteria (FIG. 3) and the neutralization activity of LPS from either P. aeruginosa or E. coli (FIG. 5). It suggests that HBc147-183 could have a strong binding activity to LPS. The results revealed a direct binding of HBc147-183 to LPS and Lipid A (FIGS. 6B, 6C and 6D). Furthermore, Lipid A moiety of LPS was shown to be one major direct target of HBc147-183 (FIG. 6E). However, incubation of LPS antibody with P. aeruginosa and HBc147-183 failed to neutralize the bactericidal activity of HBc ARD peptide (FIG. 5). One interpretation for this negative result is that HBc147-183 could bind not only LPS but also some other molecules on the bacterial membrane. We found a better neutralization effect of the LPS from P. aeruginosa than that from E. coli (FIG. 5). The preference of binding by HBc147-183 for the LPS of P. aeruginosa is correlated with its stronger bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa.  The mode of action of HBc147-183 on P. aeruginosa could be related to membrane permeabilization based on the fast killing kinetics (FIG. 2) and its membrane localization (FIGS. 3A and 3B). This speculation is also supported by the results of SYTOX Green uptake experiment (FIG. 4A). Like P. aeruginosa, HBc147-183 was also accumulated on the membrane of K. pneumonia and E. coli. However, the killing kinetics and SYTOX Green uptake experiments of K. pneumonia and E. coli did not support for a mechanism of membrane permeabilization. It remains to be further investigated how bacteria can be killed by the ARD peptides using a mechanism other than membrane permeabilization. In the case of Gram-positive bacteria, we found that HBc147-183 was not accumulated on the membrane (FIG. 3). Instead, it can enter the cytoplasm of S. aureus without any apparent development of membrane permeabilization (FIG. 4A). In addition to LPS, HBc147-183 can also bind strongly to plasmid DNA (FIG. 4C). Taken together, the bactericidal mechanism of HBc147-183 against Gram-positive bacteria appeared to be more similar to Buforin II, which was reported to kill bacteria by binding to DNA and RNA after penetrating bacterial membrane. Although HBc147-183 can penetrate through the cell membrane of Huh 7 and HepG2 cells (data not shown), we observed no significant cytotoxic effect on human hepatoma cells Huh 7 and HepG2, and kidney cells Vero and HEK293, even at a high peptide concentration (100 μM) by MTT assay (FIG. 7B) and proliferation assay (FIG. 7C). Taken together with the results from the hemolytic assay (FIG. 7A), HBc147-183 appears to be much safer relative to melittin in cell culture. The animal model study showed no apparent in vivo toxicity of ARD peptide at 20 mg/kg dose in the ICR mice by i.p. injection (FIG. 7D). At as low as 10 mg/kg level, treatment of ARD peptide can protect mice from death (FIG. 8B). In contrast, all mice receiving the PBS control were dead soon after bacterial inoculation. In addition to the sepsis survival model, treatment of ARD peptide (10 mg/kg) also resulted in a significant reduction of bacterial load of S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, whereas PBS control mice showed high levels of bacterial load (FIGS. 8C-D and FIG. 9). The results demonstrated the in vivo antimicrobial potency of HBc ARD peptide. ","BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS FIG. 1 shows amino acid sequences of various HBc ARD peptides tested for bactericidal activity. The lower panel presents various phosphorylated peptides and an R-to-A mutant peptide with a total of four Arg-to-Ala substitutions in ARD-III and ARD-IV of HBc147-183. FIG. 2 shows killing kinetics of HBc147-183 against P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli and S. aureus. Bacteria were treated with HBc147-183 (1×MBC). The viability of bacteria was measured at indicated time points. Samples were measured in triplicates. FIGS. 3A-G show localization of FITC-HBc147-183 peptide on bacteria. Approximate 107 CFU of P. aeruginosa ATCC9027, ATCC27853 (3A and 3B), K. pneumoniae ATCC13884 (3C), E. coli ATCC25922 (3D), and S. aureus ATCC19636, ATCC25923 and ATCC 29213 (3E, 3F and 3G) were incubated with HBc147-183 (0.5×MBC) for 1 hour. The bacteria were washed, fixed and stained with DAPI (blue). Images were taken using confocal microscopy. FIGS. 4A-C show possible bactericidal mechanisms of HBc147-183. (4A) SYTOX Green uptake of P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae, E. coli, and S. aureus by HBc147-183. Measurements of the fluorescence were recorded every minute. (4B) Dose-dependent curves of membrane permeabilization of P. aeruginosa by HBc147-183 and HBc153-176 at 0.5, 1 and 2 μM. Two μM melittin was used as a positive control. Samples were measured in triplicates. (4C) DNA-binding activity of HBc147-183. HBc147-183 was mixed with pSUPER plasmid DNA at indicated N/P ratio for 30 minutes. The mobility of DNA was determined by a gel retardation assay. FIG. 5 shows dose response effects of LPS and LPS antibody on the bactericidal activity of HBc147-183. LPS from P. aeruginosa and E. coli, and LPS antibody were mixed with P. aeruginosa and HBc147-183 (1×MBC) for 3 hours. The bacteria were then plated on MH agar for the measurement of viability. Samples were measured in triplicates. FIGS. 6A-E show the ARD peptide HBc147-183 being capable of binding to LPS and Lipid A in several different in vitro binding assays. Samples were measured in triplicates in each assay. (6A) The cartoon illustrates the in vitro assays of peptide-LPS and peptide-Lipid A binding as well as LPS/Lipid A competition. (6B) Constant amount of LPS was incubated with increasing concentrations of biotinylated ARD HBc 147-183 peptide on the streptavidine-conjugated beads (0, 0.004, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 μM). Unbound LPS in the supernatant was measured with the LAL ELISA assay. The EU values were normalized with a control without peptide treatment. HBc147-183 8p (containing 8 phosphorylated amino acids) was also included as a control peptide due to its poor binding with LPS. (6C) Beads-bound LPS was released into the supernatant by overnight digestion with trypsin agarose. Free LPS in the supernatant was analyzed with the LAL ELISA assay. Released LPS in the supernatant appeared to be in proportion to the amount of ARD peptide HBc147-183 on the beads. (6D) Constant amount of Lipid A was incubated with increasing concentrations of HBc147-183 and HBc147-183 8P, respectively. The supernatant was also detected with LAL ELISA reagent. The result here is consistent with the notion that Lipid A can bind to HBc147-183 directly. (6E) LPS/Lipid A competition assay. Constant amount of LPS (1 μg) was coated on each well on the ELISA plate, and then incubated with a reaction mixture containing constant amount of 10 nM HBc147-183 and increasing concentrations of Lipid A. The gradual increase of Lipid A reduced the amount of plate-bound ARD peptide HBc147-183 in a dose dependent manner. FIGS. 7A-D shows cytotoxicity assays of ARD peptide HBc147-183. (7A) Hemolytic activities of HBc147-183 and melittin were measured with 10% human red blood cells (RBC). Compared to melittin, HBc147-183 showed no hemolytic activity. (7B) Huh7, HepG2, Vero and HEK293 cells were incubated with varying concentrations (0 to 100μM) of HBc147-183 and melittin for 1 hour at 37° C. The effects on cell viability were determined by MTT assay. Melittin was used as a positive control. HBc147-183 showed no detectable effect on cell viability, while melittin exhibited strong toxicity. (7C) Kidney cells, Vero and HEK293 were stained with CFSE and seeded at day 0. At day 1, cells were incubated with varying concentrations (0 to 100 μM) of HBc147-183 for 1 hour. Cell proliferation at day 1 and day 3 were determined by flow cytometry. Similar to the mock control experiment, no significant effect on Vero and HEK293 cells was detected. Samples assayed in FIGS. 7A-C were measured in triplicates. (7D) In vivo toxicity of ARD peptide HBc147-183 was determined using three-week old male ICR mice. The mice were injected intraperitoneally with peptide (10 and 20 mg/kg of body weight). All mice were alive after 7 days. FIGS. 8A-D show in vivo studies of the protection activity of ARD peptide HBc147-183 against S. aureus. (8A) Three-week old male ICR mice were challenged with a lethal dose of S. aureus ATCC 19636 and then divided into five separate groups for five different time points. At each indicated time point (n=5), blood samples were collected, diluted and plated on BHI agar. The number of bacteria was counted the following day. A maximal bacterial load in the blood was observed at 2 h post-inoculation. The data were shown in mean 6 SD. (8B) ICR mice inoculated with a lethal dose of S. aureus as described above were treated by intraperitoneal injection with ARD peptide (10 mg/kg) at 1, 1.5 or 2 h post-inoculation, respectively. Each group contained 10 mice. All mice (100%) treated with the PBS control died at day 1, while treatment of ARD peptide at 1, 1.5 or 2 h post-inoculation protected the mice with survival rates of 100%, 70% and 40% after 7 days, respectively. (8C) As described above, ICR mice were i.p. inoculated with S. aureus, followed by i.p. injection with PBS (n=5) or 10 mg/kg ARD peptide (n=5) at 1 h post-inoculation. At 4 h post-inoculation, blood, liver and spleen were collected. Liver and spleen samples were homogenized, diluted and, together with blood samples, plated on BHI agar. The number of bacteria was counted the following day. In comparison to mice treated with PBS, treatment of ARD peptide effectively reduced the bacterial load in blood, liver and spleen. (8D) Quantitative comparison of bacterial loads in blood, liver and spleen samples of mice treated with PBS (open circle, diamond and square) versus ARD peptide HBc147-183 (solid circle, diamond and square). The line indicated the mean of bacterial load. **P,0.01 (Mann-Whitney U test) for PBS and ARD peptide HBc147-183. FIGS. 9A-B shows an IVIS analysis of in vivo antimicrobial activity of ARD peptide against K. pneumoniae. (9A) K. pneumoniae-infected mice were treated with either PBS (n=5) or 10 mg/kg ARD peptide (n=5) at 1 hour post-inoculation. Four hours post-inoculation, mice were anesthetized and imaged. Bacterial load was displayed in the photographic image with an overlay of bioluminescence. False color imaging represents intense luminescence in red, moderate luminescence in green and low luminescence in blue and purple. (9B) Total flux was quantified by IVIS imaging software. **P,0.01 (Mann-Whitney U test) for PBS and ARD peptide HBc147-183. FIG. 10 is a table showing antimicrobial activity of HBC ARD peptides. FIG. 11 is a table showing antimicrobial activity of ARD peptide HBc147-183 against colistin-resistant and sensitive P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii.  FIG. 12 shows sequence alignments of human hepatitis B virus (HBV) core protein (HBc) arginine rich domain (ARD). HBc ARD domain is highly conserved among different serotypes isolated from patients of different geographic areas. FIGS. 13A-B show sequence alignments of HBc ARD domains of hepadnaviruses from primate, rodent and avian origins. HBc ARD sequences are highly conserved among human, wooly monkey, ground squirrel, woodchuck, and bat. The arginine (positive charge) clustering subdomains at HBc ARD are designated as ARD-I, ARD-II, ARD-III, and ARD-IV. FIG. 13 B further shows that there are also four clustering positive charge amino acids in the core protein C-terminus of duck, heron, parrot, Ross's goose and snow goose hepatitis B virus. Despite the sequence divergence and evolutionary distance between the primate, rodent, and avian hepadnaviruses, it is contemplated that these positive charge-rich domain at the C-terminus of core protein from rodent (13A) and avian (13B) hepadnaviruses could also contain antimicrobial activities (cf Table 1).

There is an urgent need to develop more effective treatment to overcome the drug-resistance problem. Antimicrobial peptides (AMP) are a new class of antibiotics with a new mode of action and remarkable therapeutic effects. In general, they contain 10-50 amino acids, with an overall positive charge and an amphipathic structure. It is well known that most AMPs can directly bind to bacteria membrane and kill them by disrupting membrane or targeting intracellular components. Most importantly, they are effective to antibiotics-resistant pathogens. This unique feature has encouraged the development of AMPs as novel antibiotics in the last few decades. Prior to the present invention, no literature has reported that peptides derived from hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) possess antimicrobial activities. Hepatitis B virus core protein (21 KDa) is essential for viral replication. It contains a capsid assembly domain at N-terminus (residue 1 to 149) and an arginine-rich domain (ARD) at C-terminus (residues 150 to 183) (Birnbaum et al. (1990) J Virol 64: 3319-3330; Nassal M (1992) J Virol 66: 4107-4116). ARD contains 16 arginines separated into four arginine-rich clusters (ARD I, II, III, IV) and has a function of binding to nucleic acids. When it binds to HBV pre-genomic RNA or polyanions, HBc can assemble into a stable capsid. In addition, ARD contains important signals for nuclear export and import of HBc core protein and particles. It was unexpectedly discovered that the growth of E. coli expressing HBc1-183 was much slower than that of E. coli expressing HBc1-149 (unpublished results).

Likewise, the invention is not limited to various embodiments given in this specification. Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by one of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention pertains. In the case of conflict, the present document, including definitions will control. As used herein, “around”, “about” or “approximately” shall generally mean within 20 percent, preferably within 10 percent, and more preferably within 5 percent of a given value or range. Numerical quantities given herein are approximate, meaning that the term “around”, “about” or “approximately” can be inferred if not expressly stated. Antimicrobial activity refers to the activity to kill or inhibit the growth of microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and/or protozoans. As used herein, the term “the arginine-rich carboxy-terminal region of hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc)” refers to a highly conserved arginine-rich C-terminal region of HBc (FIGS. 12 and 13A-B) and is characterized by having an antimicrobial activity. It is contemplated that the arginine-rich carboxy-terminal regions from avian and/or rodent hepadnaviruses share the same antimicrobial activities. The C-terminal end of HBc contains four arginine-rich clusters designated as ARD I-IV. Each arginine-rich cluster or domain (ARD) contains 2 or more arginine residues in continuity or in close proximity (e.g., being separated by one or two different amino acid residues). In one embodiment, each ARD may contain 2,3 or 4 continuous arginine residues. As used herein, “an amino acid sequence derived from HBc” refers to “an amino acid sequence originates from hepatitis B virus core protein and possess an antimicrobial activity”. It may be a fragment of HBc, with or without a modification, which contains ARD and possess an antimicrobial activity. A fragment of HBc with a modification includes, but not limited to PEGylation at either N- or C-terminus. The term “two clusters” and “two repeats” are interchangeable. The term “two clusters of SPRRRR” means “2 repeats of SPRRRR”, or “2 SPRRRR”. The term “amphipathic structure” refers to a molecule having hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. The HBV is divided into four major serotypes (adr, adw, ayr, ayw) based on antigenic epitopes present on its envelope proteins. The term “serotype” or “serovar” refers to distinct variations within a species of bacteria or viruses or among immune cells of different individuals. The term “protecting group” refers to a functional group that is attached to a therapeutic protein or peptide to prolong its circulatory time. A protecting group includes, but not limited to, a polyethylene glycol (PEG). PEGylation can also provide water solubility to hydrophobic proteins or peptides. The term “treating” or “treatment” refers to administration of an effective amount of a therapeutic agent to a subject in need thereof with the purpose of cure, alleviate, relieve, remedy, ameliorate, or prevent the disease, the symptoms of it, or the predisposition towards it. Such a subject can be identified by a health care professional based on results from any suitable diagnostic method. “An effective amount” refers to the amount of an active agent that is required to confer a therapeutic effect on the treated subject. Effective doses will vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on routes of administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatment. The “Guidance for Industry and Reviewers Estimating the Safe Starting Dose in Clinical Trials for Therapeutics in Adult Healthy Volunteers” published by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Food and Drug Administration discloses “a human equivalent dose” may be obtained by calculations from the following formula: 

HED=animal dose in mg/kg×(animal weight in kg/human weight in kg)0.33.
 For example for i.p. administration, if a mouse (20 gram BW) dose is 10 mg/kg, then an human dose may be calculated as 10 mg/kg×(0.02/patient's body weight)0.33. A human equivalent effective dose, however, may vary, depending on other factors such as the route of administration. It was an unexpected discovery and unsolved mystery that the growth of E. coli expressing HBc1-183 was very poor and much slower than that of E. coli expressing HBc1-149. It appeared that it was HBc 150-183 that somehow retarded the growth of E. coli, and reduced HBc 1-183 protein yield dramatically. Here, we disclose the in vitro antimicrobial activities of HBc147-183 against a wide variety of bacteria, including multidrug resistant (MDR) and colistin (polymyxin E)-resistant A baumannii. The antimicrobial peptides from HBV core protein (HBc) arginine-rich domain (ARD) are mainly composed of SPRRR repeats and are effective against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as fungi. Using a peritoneal sepsis mouse model, it was demonstrated further that ARD peptides can effectively protect all the mice challenged with a lethal dose of Staphylococcus aureus. Treatment of ARD peptides also caused significant reduction of bacterial load of S. aureus and K. pneumoniae in infected mice. Potential mechanisms for the bactericidal activity were investigated. The ARD peptides appeared to be capable of direct binding to the Lipid A moiety of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in several different binding assays. In summary, with high antimicrobial activity and very low toxicity against human cells and animal models, these HBc ARD peptides may have a therapeutic potential in the future (Chen et al. “Identification of a Novel Antimicrobial Peptides from Human Hepatitis B Virus Core Protein Arginine-Rich Domain (ARD)” PLoS Pathog 9(6): e1003425, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In one aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising:

    
    
        (a) an effective amount of an isolated peptide, wherein the peptide comprises the arginine-rich carboxy-terminal region of hepatitis B virus core protein (HBc) and exhibits an antimicrobial activity; and
        (b) a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.
    
    

 In another aspect, the invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising:

    
    
        (a) an effective amount of an isolated peptide comprising a fragment of HBc, the fragment comprising more than one arginine-rich domain (ARD) selected from the group consisting of (i), (ii) and (iii) as follows:
        
            (i) HBc ARD I-IV;

The subject may be afflicted with Staphylococcus aureus or K. pneumoniae infection. The antimicrobial peptide according to the invention contains few or no hydrophobic amino acids, and thus has no amphipathic structure. In one embodiment of the invention, the peptide comprises the amino acid sequence of Ser Pro Arg Arg Arg Arg (SPRRRR; SEQ ID NO: 13) or Arg Arg Arg Ser (RRRS; SEQ ID NO: 14). Alternatively, the peptide may comprise two clusters of SPRRRR (SEQ ID NO: 13), or three clusters of SPRRR (SEQ ID NO: 15). The peptide may comprise RRRS (SEQ ID NO: 14).

The at least 2 clusters of PR may be immediately adjacent to, or nearby the RRRS sequence with a few residues apart, such as 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17 or 18 amino acid residues apart. The peptide has no RRGGRRRR sequence (SEQ ID NO: 17) at the C-terminus thereof. The peptide may comprise a protecting group. In another embodiment of the invention, the peptide has a cysteine (C) at the C-terminus thereof.

MATERIALS AND METHODS All animal experiments were conducted under protocols approved by Academia Sinica Institutional Animal Care & Utilization Committee (ASIACUC permit number 12-02-322). Research was conducted in compliance with the principles stated in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals, National Research Council, 1996. Bacterial Isolates The antimicrobial activities of HBc ARD peptides were tested on numerous bacterial strains from ATCC, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa Migula strain (ATCC 27853, ampicillin-resistant), Pseudomonas aeruginosa Migula strain (ATCC 9027, ampicillin-resistant), Klebsiella pneumoniae strain (ATCC 17593), Escherichia coli strain (ATCC 25922), Staphylococcus aureus subsp. strain (ATCC 25923, methicillin-resistant), Staphylococcus aureus subsp. strain (ATCC 29213, methicillin-resistant), Staphylococcus aureus subsp. strain (ATCC 19636, methicillinresistant), and Candida albicans strain (ATCC 10231). Clinical isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa (NHRI-01, NHRI-02 AND NHRI-04) were obtained through the program of Taiwan Surveillance of Antimicrobial Resistance, National Health Research Institutes, Taiwan. Acinetobacter baumannii (ATCC 17989, ATCC 17978 CR, ATCC19606, ATCC 19606 CR, TCGH 45530 AND TCGH 46709) were obtained from Tzu-Chi Buddhist General Hospital in Taiwan, and clinical isolates (TCGH 45530 AND TCGH 46709) were identified using the Vitek system (Biomerieux Vitek, Inc., MO, USA). A. baumannii is defined as multidrug-resistant when the organism is resistant to piperacillin, piperacillin-tazobactam, ampicillin/sulbactam, imipenem, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, and cotrimoxazole. Susceptibility to colistin was determined using the broth-dilution method, in accordance with the guidelines of the Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Antimicrobial Activity All peptides were purchased from Yao-Hong Biotechnology Inc. (Taipei, Taiwan). Vendors provided data of peptide characterizations, including HPLC and Mass. Antimicrobial activity was determined as described with some modifications as detailed below. Bacteria were grown overnight in Mueller-Hinton broth (Difco) at 37° C., and during the mid-logarithmic phase, bacteria were diluted to 106 CFU (colony formation unit)/m1 in phosphate buffer (10 mM sodium phosphate and 50 mM sodium chloride, pH 7.2). Peptides were serially diluted in the same buffer. Fifty microliter (μl) of bacteria was mixed with fifty μl of peptides at varying concentrations followed by incubation at 37° C. for 3 hours without shaking. At the end of incubation, bacteria were placed on Mueller-Hinton broth agar plates, and allowed growth at 37° C. overnight for measurement of minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC). The lowest peptide concentration on the agar plate, which displayed no bacterial growth (zero colony), was defined as MBC. All peptides were tested in triplicate. For measurement of killing kinetics, bacteria and peptides were prepared as described above. Fifty μl of bacteria were mixed with fifty pl of peptides at the concentrations corresponding to MBC and were incubated at 37° C. At the indicated time, bacteria were serially diluted and placed on Mueller-Hinton broth agar plates for viability measurement. Confocal Fluorescence Microscopy The localization of peptide was monitored by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Bacteria were grown to mid-logarithmic phase and collected by centrifugation. Approximate 107 CFU were resuspended in a phosphate buffer containing FITC-labeled HBc147-183 at a concentration corresponding to 0.5×MBC. Following incubation for 1 hour at 37° C., cells were washed, fixed, and immobilized on poly-L-lysine coated glass slides. ProLong Gold antifade reagent with DAPI (Invitrogen) was added to the slides prior to mounting. Localization of labeled-peptide was observed using an Olympus Ultraview confocal microscopy equipped with a 100× oil immersion lens. SYTOX Green Uptake Briefly, bacteria (107 CFU) were prepared and mixed with 1 μM SYTOX Green (Invitrogen) for 15 minutes in the dark. After the addition of peptides to the final concentrations corresponding to their respective MBC, fluorescence intensity was measured at 37° C. using wavelengths 485 nm and 520 nm filters for excitation and emission. Melittin (Sigma), a major toxin of bee venom, was used as a positive control to provide maximal permeabilization. Gel Retardation Assay The proportion between amino nitrogen (NH3+) of HBc147-183 and phosphate (PO4−) of DNA was defined as N/P ratio. Briefly, HBc147-183 was incubated with pSUPER plasmid DNA at different N/P ratio (0, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1, 2, 3 and 4) for 30 minutes at 37° C. The mobility of pSUPER plasmid DNA was analyzed by electrophoresis on 1% agarose gel. In Vitro Binding Assay Between ARD Peptides and LPS/Lipida Several kinds of peptide-LPS or peptide-Lipid A binding assays were performed as follows:

    
    
        1) Streptavidine-conjugated beads (Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin T1, Invitrogen) were blocked by P. aeruginosa LPS (Sigma) at 37° C. for 1.5 hour. After washing with PBST (PBS, pH 7.4 containing 0.1% (w/v) Tween-20), aliquots containing 250 pmol streptavidine-conjugated beads were incubated with a reaction mixture overnight at 4° C. The reaction mixture was prepared by mixing increasing amounts of biotinylated peptide HBc147-183 (0, 0.004, 0.02, 0.1, 0.5 and 2.5 μM) and 5 μg/ml P. aeruginosa LPS (Sigma) or 200 μg/ml E. coli lipid A (Sigma), at 37° C. for 3 hour. After incubation overnight at 4° C., the reduction of LPS (or Lipid A) in the supernatants were measured by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test (Charles River Endosafe) with an ELISA reader (Molecular Devices). The amount (EU/ml) of LPS was calculated according to the standard curve prepared with Endosafe Control Srandard Endotoxin.
        2) To directly measure the increasing amounts of LPS bound to the increasing amounts of peptide HBc147-183 on the peptide-coated beads, the beads were then washed with PBST three times and incubated with 100 μl of PBS containing 0.15 units of trypsin agarose (Sigma) for overnight digestion at 37° C. After trypsinization, the trypsin-released LPS in the supernatants were collected and measured by the Limulus Amebocyte Lysate (LAL) test. Similar results were obtained by another LPS testing method: Endosafe-PST Cartridges (Charles River Laboratories).
        3) To perform the LPS/Lipid A competition assay, one μg of LPS was coated on High Binding ELISA plates (Corning) overnight at 4° C. The LPS-coated plates were washed by PBST and then blocked with PBST containing 5% BSA for 1 hour at 37° C. After washing, HBc147-183 (10 nM), mixed with varying concentrations of E. coli Lipid A (0 to 10m/ml), were added into each well and incubated for 1 hour at 37° C. Plate-bound HBc147-183 was measured by streptavidin conjugated with HRP (1:10000 dilution) for 1 hour at 37° C. TMB substrates were added into each well for color development. The absorption was measured at 450 nm with a reference wavelength at 655 nm.
    
    

 Hemolytic Activity The hemolytic activities of peptides were determined by hemolysis against human red blood cells (hRBCs). Human blood was obtained in EDTA-containing tube and was centrifuged at 450 g for 10 min. The pellet was washed three times with PBS buffer, and a solution of 10% hRBCs was prepared. hRBCs solution was mixed with serial dilutions of peptides in PBS buffer, and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 1 h at 37° C. After centrifugation at 450 g for 10 min, the percentage of hemolysis was determined by measuring the absorbance at the wavelength of 405 nm of the supernatant. Blank and 100% hemolysis were determined in PBS buffer and in the presence of 1% Triton X-100, respectively. Cytotoxicity Cytotoxicity was measured in HepG2, Huh7, HEK293, and Vero cells by MTT assay. Cells were seeded at 104 cells/well in a 96-well plate and serial dilutions of peptides were added into each well. PBS was used as a negative control and melittin was used as a positive control. After 1 hour of incubation, the medium were replaced by a fresh medium containing 10% MTT solution (PROMEGA™), and the plate was incubated for 4 hours in 5% CO2 at 37° C. The absorbance at the wavelength of 595 nm was measured by an ELISA reader (BIO-RAD™ model 680). CFSE Cell Proliferation Assay To set up CFSE cell proliferation assay, 293 cells (human kidney origin) and Vero cells (monkey kidney origin) were resuspended in PBS to a final concentration of 106 cells/ml before incubation with 10 μM CFSE dye (CELLTRACE™ CFSE cell proliferation kit, INVITROGEN™) at 37° C. for 10 min. To quench the staining, ice-old culture media were then added and incubated on ice for 5 min. Labeled cells were then pelleted and washed three times with a fresh medium containing 10% FBS before seeding into six well plates at a density of 3.3×105cells/well. After 20 h, the medium was removed and incubated with a fresh medium containing 5, 25 and 100 μM HBc 147-183 for one hour (FITC-labeled ARD peptide had been largely internalized in 10 minutes after the addition of ARD peptides to the medium of HepG2 cells). Forty-eight hours later, cells were harvested and analyzed by flow cytometry (FACSCanto, BD Bioscience). In Vivo Animal Studies Three-week old male ICR mice (19 to 21 g) were purchased from BioLASCO (Taiwan). Overnight culture of bacteria in BHI broth (Difco) was subcultured in fresh BHI broth to log phase. Inoculums were diluted in BHI broth to indicated densities. To test the acute toxicity of ARD peptide in vivo, ICR male mice were inoculated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 10 and 20 mg/kg HBc147-183 in PBS, respectively. Each group contained 5 mice. After peptide injection, the number of dead mice was recorded daily for 7 days post-injection. To test the antimicrobial activity of the ARD peptide in vivo, all mice were inoculated i.p. with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19636 (4×106 CFU/mouse) in BHI broth. Peptide HBc147-183 (10 mg/kg) was administered i.p. at 1, 1.5 and 2 hours post-inoculation. PBS (10 ml/kg) control was administered at 1 hour post-inoculation. Each group contained 10 mice. Mortality was monitored daily for 7 days post-inoculation. In a separate experiment to measure the bacterial load, mice were inoculated i.p. with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19636 (106 CFU/mouse) in BHI broth. All mice were administered at 1 hour post-inoculation with peptide HBc147-183 (10 mg/kg) or PBS (10 ml/kg) control, and sacrificed at 4 hours post-inoculation. Blood samples (200 μl) were mixed with 100 mM EDTA (10 μl) and were diluted 20-fold in PBS (Ca2+ and Mg2+ free). Liver and spleen samples (0.1 g) were homogenized in sterile PBS (500 μl). Samples were diluted approximately 100-fold and plated on BHI agar for scoring the colony numbers. To test the in vivo antimicrobial activity of the ARD peptide against Gram-negative bacteria, mice were inoculated with Klebsiella pneumoniae Xen39 (107 cfu/mouse) (Caliper LifeSciences), an engineered strain containing a modified Photorhabdus luminescens luxABCDE operon. One hour post-inoculation, mice received either 10 ml/kg PBS (n=5) or 10 mg/kg ARD peptide (n=5), respectively. In vivo imaging was carried out at 4 hours post-inoculation. The mice were anesthetized first before transferring to the IVIS imaging system (IVIS spectrum), and luminescence was measured with an exposure time of 1 minutes or less. The image system measured the number of photons and translated the data to false color images that depicted the region of strong luminescence with red, moderate luminescence with yellow and green, and mild luminescence with blue. Decreasing bioluminescence indicated reduction of bacteria. The images were overlay of photographic images and bioluminescence using a computer-generated color scale. Total flux (RLU) of region of interest (ROI) was quantified by the IVIS imaging software. RESULTS In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity of HBc Peptides As shown in FIGS. 1 and 10, HBc147-183 displayed a broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative bacteria (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumoniae and E. coli), Gram-positive bacteria (S. aureus), and fungi (C. albicans). Among these tested strains, P. aeruginosa and K. pneumonia were the most sensitive to this peptide. The MBCs of HBc147-183 were lower than 4 μM for P. aeruginosa and K. pneumonia, and around 4 μM for E. coli, and S. aureus. C. albicans was the least sensitive to this peptide (MBC ˜8 μM). To further map the active sequences of the antimicrobial activity, various peptides (FIG. 1) in different length were synthesized and tested as before. Peptide HBc147-175, with the deletion of the last eight amino acids at the C-terminus, maintained strong activity against Gram-negative bacteria, albeit it lost the activity against S. aureus and C. albicans. We detected no activity against all of the tested bacteria and fungi from peptides ARD I-II (HBc147-159) or ARD III-IV (HBc164-176 and HBc162-175). In contrast, all peptides containing ARD II-IV (HBc153-176, HBc157-176, HBc153-175, HBc155-175, and HBc157-175) and ARD I-III (HBc147-167) exhibited strong activity against P. aeruginosa and K. pneumonia, respectively, albeit they were weak against E. coli (FIG. 10). Therefore, peptide ARD II-IV and ARD I-III appeared to be necessary and sufficient for the bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa and K. pneumonia.  Positive Charge of ARD Peptides is Critical to the Bactericidal Activity Phophorylation studies on serine residues S155, S162, S170, S176 and S181 revealed that serine phosphorylation in general weakened the potency of antimicrobial activity. It was found that all HBc peptides, once phosphorylated, lost their activities against C. albicans (FIG. 11). For bacteria, the phosphorylation on S181 showed no effects, whereas phosphorylations on S155, S162, S170, and S176 reduced the antimicrobial activity. The MBCs dropped to 8 μM for HBc155p and HBc176p, and 32 μM for HBc162p and HBc170p, respectively. When S155, S162 and S170 were simultaneously phosphorylated (HBc155p162p170p), the antimicrobial activity was completely lost (>32 μM). The results suggested that, except for S181, serine phosphorylation is generally detrimental to the antimicrobial activity of HBc ARD peptide. To confirm the importance of arginine residues for bactericidal activity, we synthesized and tested peptide HBc147-183-III-IV AA, which has two R-to-A substitution mutations in each of ARD III and ARD IV. Similar to phosphorylated HBc ARD peptides, the MBC of HBc147-183-III-IV AA was significantly increased compared to HBc147-183. The result indicated that arginine residues are required for the antimicrobial activity. Drug Resistance The antimicrobial activity of HBc147-183 against colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii was tested. As shown in FIG. 11, while HBc147-183 killed colistin-sensitive P. aeruginosa at 4 μM, colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa were cross-resistant to HBc147-183 (MBC>16 μM). In contrast to P. aeruginosa, the MBCs of HBc147-183 against colistin-sensitive and colistin-resistant A. baumannii are in a similar range of 0.5-1 μM. This result indicates that, for colistin-resistant A. baumannii, there is no cross-resistance to our ARD peptide HBc147-183. Killing Kinetics Time course of bacterial viability was determined after the tested bacteria (P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia, E. coli and S. aureus) were treated with HBc147-183 at the concentrations corresponding to the MBC (FIG. 2). The results showed that P. aeruginosa was immediately killed within 20 minutes upon the addition of HBc147-183 (2 μM). Although K. pneumonia and E. coli were members of Gram-negative bacteria, they were killed by 4 μM HBc147-183 in 180 minutes. For S. aureus, complete killing by 4 μM HBc147-183 was observed in 120 minutes. Localization and Mechanism of HBc147-183 P. aeruginosa, E. coli and S. aureus were treated with FITC-labeled HBc147-183 corresponding to 0.5×MBC, and the localization of HBc147-183 was visualized using confocal fluorescence microscopy (FIG. 3). The results showed that, upon peptide treatment, P. aeruginosa, K. pneumonia and E. coli appeared as hollow rods with fluorescence clearly defined bacteria surface, suggesting that HBc147-183 was accumulated on the membrane (FIGS. 3A-D). To understand better the effect of HBc peptides on the membranes, SYTOX Green uptake assay was performed. A significant degree of membrane permeabilization was induced on P. aeruginosa upon the addition of 2 μM HBc147-183 (FIG. 4A). Although it was also accumulated on the membrane of K. pneumonia and E. coli, 4 μM HBc147-183 was not able to induce membrane permeabilization as observed on S. aureus. Consistent with the bactericidal activity of HBc147-183 against P. aeruginosa, HBc153-176 caused same membrane permeabilization within 10 minutes in a dose-dependent manner (FIG. 4B). This indicated that the bactericidal effect of HBc peptides on P. aeruginosa is directly through the membrane permeabilization with a fast kinetics similar to that of killing kinetics (FIG. 2). On the other hand, HBc147-183 was found to penetrate through the membrane of S. aureus and localized in the cytoplasm (FIGS. 3E-G). To investigate the potential interaction between HBc 147-183 and DNA, HBc147-183 was mixed with pSUPER plasmid DNA at different N/P ratio (Materials and Methods) and analyzed by gel electrophoresis (FIG. 4C). The results showed that the mobility of DNA was decreased when the ratio of peptide/DNA increased and the plasmid DNA was completely retarded at the ratio of 1, suggesting that HBc147-183 has a strong binding activity to plasmid DNA. Overall, it suggests that the bactericidal mechanisms of HBc147-183 on Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria may be completely different. Direct Binding of HBc147-183 to LPS To determine whether LPS of Gram-negative bacteria could serve as a potential target of HBc147-183, LPS (0.05 to 50 μg/ml) from either P. aeruginosa or E. coli (Sigma) were incubated with both P. aeruginosa and 2 μM HBc147-183 for three hours, respectively. The results showed that the bactericidal activity of HBc147-183 was significantly reduced by addition of either LPS at the concentration of 50 μg/ml (FIG. 5). In addition, HBc147-183 preferentially bound to the LPS from P. aeruginosa, rather than that from E. coli. However, the addition of anti-LPS antibody (Genetex Co.) cannot sufficiently neutralize the bactericidal activity of HBc147-183 (FIG. 5). It suggests that HBc147-183 could bind to not only LPS but also other target molecules on the membrane. Alternatively, HBc147-183 and the anti-LPS polyclonal antibody used here could bind predominantly to two different epitopes on the LPS. As shown in FIG. 6A, the potential interaction between HBc147-183 and LPS (or Lipid A moiety) in vitro was investigated using several different binding assays. In FIG. 6B, when increasing amount of HBc147-183 was bound to the strepavidine-conjugated Dynabeads and allowed incubation with a constant amount of LPS, gradually increasing amount of LPS appeared to be depleted from the supernatant. HBc147-183 8p, which has eight ser/thr phosphorylations, was used in parallel as a control peptide. Similar results were obtained by another LPS testing method: Endosafe-PTS Cartridges (Charles River Laboratories). In FIG. 6C, the beads-captured LPS were dissociated from the beads by trypsin agarose digestion of the ARD peptide HBc147-183. The amount of released LPS was measured by the LAL test (Materials and Methods). LPS contains mainly the polysaccharide and Lipid A moieties. To determine whether the ARD peptide can bind to Lipid A directly, we tested in FIG. 6D the binding between Lipid A and the ARD peptide in a manner similar to FIG. 6B. As expected, increasing amounts of HBc147-183 on the beads led to decreasing amounts of Lipid A remaining in the supernatant. The inverse correlation between the ARD peptide on the beads and the Lipid A in the supernatant (FIG. 6D) is strikingly similar to what was observed previously between the ARD peptide HBc147-183 on the beads and LPS in the supernatant (FIG. 6B). To directly demonstrate that the ARD peptide can bind to the Lipid A moiety of LPS, we performed a competition experiment between Lipid A and LPS (FIG. 6E). The LPS-coated ELISA plates were incubated with constant amount of HBc147-183 (10 nM), which was premixed with varying concentrations of E. coli Lipid A (0 to 10 μg/ml). After extensive washing, plate-bound (i.e., LPS-bound) biotinylated peptide HBc147-183 was measured by streptavidin conjugated with HRP, followed by adding TMB substrates and color development. The binding of HBc147-183 to LPS was significantly decreased by the increasing concentrations of Lipid A (FIG. 6E). The result here lends support for the notion that Lipid A moiety of LPS can serve as a direct target for ARD peptide HBc147-183. Cytocoxicity To determine the cytotoxicity of HBc peptides, we measured the hemolytic activity of HBc147-183. Compared to the melittin control, no detectable hemolysis by HBc147-183 was observed after one hour of incubation (FIG. 7A). In addition, MTT assay was performed to determine the cytotoxicity of HBc147-183 to human hepatoma (Huh 7 and HepG2 cells) and kidney cells (Vero and HEK293 cells). The viability of cells treated with melittin at low dose (3.125 μM) was significantly decreased. In contrast, HBc147-183 caused only a low level of cytotoxicity at the concentration of 100 μM (FIG. 7B). The CFSE cell proliferation assay was also performed to determine the effect of HBc147-183 on the proliferation of Vero and HEK293 kidney cells. In comparison to day 1, CFSE intensity of cells treated with HBc147-183 (5, 25 and 100 μM) decreased to the same level as the mock control on day 3 (FIG. 7C), suggesting that ARD peptide HBc147-183 has no significant effect on cell proliferation. Animal Model To conduct the experimental infection with bacteria, we i.p. inoculated mice with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19636 (4×106 cfu/mouse). Bacterial load in blood at 1, 2, 4 and 6 hours post-inoculation was determined. As shown in FIG. 8A, bacteria rapidly transferred to the blood compartment from peritoneal cavity. Within 2 hours, the number of bacteria in the blood achieved the maximum (106 cfu/ml). Thereafter, the number of bacteria in the blood gradually decreased spontaneously. To distinguish the ARD peptide-mediated from the spontaneous clearance, we therefore tested the in vivo protection activity of the ARD peptide within 2 hours post-inoculation. Briefly, mice were i.p. inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 19636 and received a single dose of 10 ml/kg PBS or a single dose of 10 mg/kg ARD peptide at 1, 1.5, 2 hours post-inoculation, respectively. Mice (n=10) treated with PBS died within 24 hours post-inoculation (FIG. 8B). In contrast, administration of ARD peptide (10 mg/kg) at 1 hour post-inoculation can effectively protect all mice (n=10) from death at day 7. When we administered ARD peptide at 1.5 (n=10) and 2 (n=10) hours post- inoculation, survival rates were decreased to 70% and 40%, respectively. Instead of using death as a surrogate indicator of the antimicrobial activity of ARD peptide, we also determined directly the in vivo effect of ARD peptide on bacterial load of infected mice (FIG. 8C). Mice were inoculated with Staphylococcus aureus as before and treated with 10 ml/kg PBS (n=5) or 10 mg/kg ARD peptide (n=5) at 1 hour post-inoculation. Four hours post-inoculation, bacterial load in blood, liver and spleen samples of control mice were in the range of 106 cfu/ml (FIGS. 8C and 8D). Administration of ARD peptide significantly reduced the bacterial load (˜104 cfu/ml) by 100-fold in blood, liver and spleen than the PBS control mice (P<0.01). In addition to Staphylococcus aureus, we also examined the in vivo antimicrobial activity of ARD peptide on K. pneumoniae using an IVIS imaging system. Similar to the change in bacterial load of S. aureus, bioluminescence of mice inoculated with K. pneumoniae Xen39 peaked at 2 hour post-inoculation (data not shown). We then treated K. pneumoniae Xen39-infected mice with PBS or ARD peptide at 1 hour post-inoculation, respectively. The results showed that the bioluminescence of ARD peptide-treated mice was very weak, whereas PBS control showed a more extensive bioluminescence (FIG. 9A). There was a significant difference in the overall RLU values of mice treated with PBS versus ARD peptide (P<0.01) (FIG. 9B). Taken together, the results indicated that HBc147-183 exhibited significant antimicrobial activity in vivo. Table 1 shows comparison of minimal bactericidal concentrations of human HBc ARD and woodchuck HBc ARD against Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria.

 The invention relates to a novel antimicrobial peptide (HBc147-183) isolated from the C-terminal domain of HBc. The computer program based on the antimicrobial peptide database (Wang et al. (2004) Nucleic Acids Res 32: D590-592) predicted unfavorably that HBc147-183 could serve as an antibacterial peptide, due to its very low content of hydrophobic amino acids. Contrary to the computer prediction, surprisingly, HBc147-183 exhibited a broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity. While colistin-resistant P. aeruginosa exhibited cross-resistance to ARD peptide HBc147-183, we found a strong activity of hbc147-183 (MBC=0.5-1 μm) against all tested colistin-resistant A. baumannii. Our ARD peptide could bind to Lipid A of E. coli and LPS of P. aeruginosa (FIG. 6). While only the full-length HBc147-183 (ARD I-IV) was effective against the tested gram-positive bacteria, S. aureus, ARD II-IV (HBc153-176) and ARD I-III (HBc147-167), in a less than full-length context, exhibited strong activity against gram-negative P. aeruginosa and K. pneumoniae, respectively (but not E. coli). Comparisons with Other AMPs It is surprising that the ARD domain of HBc protein (HBc147-183) exhibits novel and broad spectrum antimicrobial activity. This peptide shares some degree of similarity with several antimicrobial peptides in literature, such as protamine (PRRRRSSSRPVRRRRRPRVSRRRRRRGGRRRR; SEQ ID NO: 11) and drosocin (GKPRPYSPRPTSHPRPIRV; SEQ ID NO: 12). A radial diffusion assay showed that a single arginine-rich domain (RRRR) is sufficient for antimicrobial activity, especially against gram-negative bacteria (Lesmes et al. (2009) Peptides 30: 2150-2160). Unlike protamine, the arginine-rich domain of HBc147-183, such as ARD I-II and ARD III-IV, were not sufficient for the antimicrobial activity. In addition, sequence alignment by anitimicrobial peptide database revealed that HBc153-176 shares 44% amino acid sequence homology with Drosocin, which is a proline-rich peptide isolated from Drosophila. However, except for P. aeruginosa, Drosocin is predominately active against most Gram-negative bacteria. Drosocin kills bacteria via an apparently non-membranolytic mechanism. The HBc ARD is a novel peptide with a broad spectrum bactericidal activity quite distinct from other known arginine-rich antimicrobial peptides. Protamine contains RRGGRRRR (SEQ ID NO: 17), while HBc147-183 contains SQSRESQC (SEQ ID NO: 16) at the C-terminus of HBc. Bactericidal Mechanisms The results showed the membrane localization of HBc147-183 on Gram-negative bacteria (FIG. 3) and the neutralization activity of LPS from either P. aeruginosa or E. coli (FIG. 5). It suggests that HBc147-183 could have a strong binding activity to LPS. The results revealed a direct binding of HBc147-183 to LPS and Lipid A (FIGS. 6B, 6C and 6D). Furthermore, Lipid A moiety of LPS was shown to be one major direct target of HBc147-183 (FIG. 6E). However, incubation of LPS antibody with P. aeruginosa and HBc147-183 failed to neutralize the bactericidal activity of HBc ARD peptide (FIG. 5). One interpretation for this negative result is that HBc147-183 could bind not only LPS but also some other molecules on the bacterial membrane. We found a better neutralization effect of the LPS from P. aeruginosa than that from E. coli (FIG. 5). The preference of binding by HBc147-183 for the LPS of P. aeruginosa is correlated with its stronger bactericidal activity against P. aeruginosa.  The mode of action of HBc147-183 on P. aeruginosa could be related to membrane permeabilization based on the fast killing kinetics (FIG. 2) and its membrane localization (FIGS. 3A and 3B). This speculation is also supported by the results of SYTOX Green uptake experiment (FIG. 4A). Like P. aeruginosa, HBc147-183 was also accumulated on the membrane of K. pneumonia and E. coli. However, the killing kinetics and SYTOX Green uptake experiments of K. pneumonia and E. coli did not support for a mechanism of membrane permeabilization. It remains to be further investigated how bacteria can be killed by the ARD peptides using a mechanism other than membrane permeabilization. In the case of Gram-positive bacteria, we found that HBc147-183 was not accumulated on the membrane (FIG. 3). Instead, it can enter the cytoplasm of S. aureus without any apparent development of membrane permeabilization (FIG. 4A). In addition to LPS, HBc147-183 can also bind strongly to plasmid DNA (FIG. 4C). Taken together, the bactericidal mechanism of HBc147-183 against Gram-positive bacteria appeared to be more similar to Buforin II, which was reported to kill bacteria by binding to DNA and RNA after penetrating bacterial membrane. Although HBc147-183 can penetrate through the cell membrane of Huh 7 and HepG2 cells (data not shown), we observed no significant cytotoxic effect on human hepatoma cells Huh 7 and HepG2, and kidney cells Vero and HEK293, even at a high peptide concentration (100 μM) by MTT assay (FIG. 7B) and proliferation assay (FIG. 7C). Taken together with the results from the hemolytic assay (FIG. 7A), HBc147-183 appears to be much safer relative to melittin in cell culture. The animal model study showed no apparent in vivo toxicity of ARD peptide at 20 mg/kg dose in the ICR mice by i.p. injection (FIG. 7D). At as low as 10 mg/kg level, treatment of ARD peptide can protect mice from death (FIG. 8B). In contrast, all mice receiving the PBS control were dead soon after bacterial inoculation. In addition to the sepsis survival model, treatment of ARD peptide (10 mg/kg) also resulted in a significant reduction of bacterial load of S. aureus and K. pneumoniae, whereas PBS control mice showed high levels of bacterial load (FIGS. 8C-D and FIG. 9). The results demonstrated the in vivo antimicrobial potency of HBc ARD peptide.

The present invention can inhibit the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain. In addition, the present invention can be applied more easily with respect to the suppression of the intracerebral action of beta-amyloid and thus is advantageous in having excellent applicability.
"," 1. A peptide consisting of an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or an amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 2, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.  2. An inhibitor for inhibiting entry of beta-amyloid into a brain, comprising the peptide or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof of claim 1.  3. A pharmaceutical composition for treatment or prevention of at least one selected from among Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and inflammation of a brain, comprising the peptide or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof of claim 1.  4. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 3, wherein the at least one selected from among Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and inflammation of the brain is caused by deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain.  5. The pharmaceutical composition of claim 3, wherein the treatment or prevention is due to inhibition of entry of beta-amyloid into the brain. ","TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a novel peptide, and more particularly to a novel peptide exhibiting an effect of inhibiting the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain and the use thereof. BACKGROUND ART Beta-amyloid, which acts in the brain, is known to cause diseases, including Alzheimer's disease, dementia such as vascular dementia, alcoholic dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and inflammation of the brain (Irvine G B, El-Agnaf O M, Shankar G M, Walsh D M. “Protein aggregation in the brain: the molecular basis for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases” Mol Med. 2008; 14(7-8):451-64, etc.). In particular, Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the most common degenerative brain disease that causes dementia, accounting for 55-70% of all dementia. Most of the drugs currently developed for dementia are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors that inhibit the degradation of acetylcholine, which is a neurotransmitter that is very important for memory function (U.S. Pat. No. 4,895,841, etc.). The acetylcholinesterase inhibitors focus on symptom relief rather than eliminating the cause thereof. Major side effects of these drugs include hyperactivity of the parasympathetic nervous system owing to excessive increase of acetylcholine, resulting in adverse digestive and neuropsychiatric events such as severe diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, depression, anxiety, insomnia, headaches, and the like. These drugs are difficult to use as practical therapeutic agents for Alzheimer's disease. Meanwhile, peptides comprising the specific amino acid sequence (DAEF) are known as neuroprotective peptides that inhibit beta-amyloid-induced neuronal cytotoxicity (International Patent Publication No. WO 2006/031330 A2). Such peptides are known only to reduce or prevent beta-amyloid-induced effects such as tau protein phosphorylation or neuronal cell death. Furthermore, since such a neuroprotective peptide needs to pass through a blood-brain barrier (BBB) in order to exhibit effects in the brain, additional means for entry into the brain (e.g., a catheter inserted by neurosurgery, etc.) has to be applied, which is considered difficult. Accordingly, there is a need to develop drugs that may be more easily applied with the goal of inhibiting the intracerebral action of beta-amyloid. CITATION LIST Patent Literature

Also, it will be apparent that D may be interpreted as having a meaning including aspartic acid, as well as aspartate, as the amino acid. Furthermore, it will be apparent that E may be interpreted as having a meaning including glutamic acid, as well as glutamate, as the amino acid. The peptide includes variants thereof in which a portion of the peptide structure according to the present invention is varied by natural mutation or artificial mutation without changing the main activity thereof. Examples of the pharmaceutically acceptable salt may include hydrochloride, sulfate, phosphate, acetate, citrate, tartrate, succinate, lactate, maleate, fumarate, oxalate, methane sulfonate, and para-toluene sulfonate. Both the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 (DGEFF) and the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 (DGEF) include DGEF in common. The present inventors have ascertained that the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention, having the common sequence, is effective at inhibiting the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain through the following tests. Thereby, the present invention is capable of more directly and easily inhibiting the intracerebral action (intracerebral deposition, etc.) of beta-amyloid. Specifically, the present invention is capable of easily inhibiting the intracerebral action of beta-amyloid even without the application of additional means (e.g. a catheter inserted by neurosurgery, etc.) for passing through a blood-brain barrier. Also, the present invention is capable of inhibiting the entry of beta-amyloid alone into the brain, thus exhibiting more direct effects on beta-amyloid-related diseases, symptoms and the like. This is because the treatment, prevention and alleviation of diseases and symptoms caused by intracerebral action of beta-amyloid may become possible by suppressing the intracerebral action of beta-amyloid due to inhibition of entry of beta-amyloid into the brain. The inhibition of entry of beta-amyloid into the brain may result from suppressing the binding of beta-amyloid and RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products) using the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention. RAGE is a receptor for transporting beta-amyloid into the brain, and the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention binds to RAGE in place of beta-amyloid, thereby suppressing the binding of beta-amyloid to RAGE, whereby the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain may be inhibited. Therefore, the present invention provides the use of the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention, and preferably the use thereof for inhibition of entry of beta-amyloid into the brain or for the treatment or prevention of at least one selected from among Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and inflammation of the brain. Here, the term “treatment” comprehensively means the reduction or alleviation of symptoms, and the term “prevention” is used with a comprehensive meaning including inhibition of progression of the disease from the asymptomatic stage before disease. The dementia may be at least one selected from among Alzheimer's dementia, vascular dementia, alcoholic dementia, and dementia with Lewy bodies. At least one selected from among Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and inflammation of the brain may be caused by the deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain. The treatment or prevention may be due to inhibition of entry of beta-amyloid into the brain. Also, the treatment or prevention may be due to at least one selected from among inhibition of deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain and inhibition of inflammation of the brain. The inhibition of deposition of beta-amyloid may result from the inhibition of entry of beta-amyloid into the brain. Therefore, the present invention provides an inhibitor for the inhibition of entry of beta-amyloid into the brain, comprising the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention. Also, the present invention provides a composition for the treatment or prevention of at least one selected from among Alzheimer's disease, dementia, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and inflammation of the brain, comprising the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention. The composition may be a pharmaceutical composition. The inhibitor or the composition may contain, as an active ingredient, the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention. The inhibitor or the composition further contains a pharmaceutically acceptable additive, and may be composed of the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention and the additive as above. The peptide of the present invention may be prepared by methods typically useful in the field of peptide chemistry. For example, the peptide may be prepared by the method disclosed by Schroder and Lubke, ┌The Peptides┘ vol. 1, Academic Press, New York (1965), or by the method such as solution synthesis or solid synthesis. Examples of the process for forming a peptide bond may include an acyl azide method, an acyl halide method, an acyl imidazole method, a carbodiimide method, a phosphonium method, an anhydride method, a mixed anhydride method, an oxidation-reduction method, and the use of Woodward regent K. Before the condensation reaction, a carboxyl group, an amino group or the like, not participating in the reaction, may be protected, and a carboxyl group that participates in the condensation reaction may be activated by methods known in the art. Examples of the functional group for protecting the carboxyl group may include ester-forming groups, such as methyl, tert-butyl, aryl, pentafluorophenyl, benzyl, para-methoxybenzyl, and methoxyethoxymethyl. Examples of the functional group for protecting the amino group may include trityl carbonyl, aryloxycarbonyl, cyclohexyloxycarbonyl, trichloroethyloxycarbonyl, benzyloxycarbonyl, tert-butoxycarbonyl, and/or 9-fluorenylmethyloxycarbonyl. Examples of the active form of the carboxyl group may include mixed anhydride, azide, acyl chloride, and active ester [ester with alcohol (e.g. pentachlorophenol, 2,4-dinitrophenol, cyanomethyl alcohol, p-nitrophenol, N-hydroxy-5-norborene-2,3-dicarboxylimide, N-hydroxysuccinimide, N-hydroxyphthalimide, or 1-hydroxybenzotriazole)]. The solvent usable in the condensation reaction for forming a peptide bond may include benzene, toluene, hexane, acetone, nitromethane, cyclohexane, ether, chloroform, dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, N,N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, pyridine, dioxane, tetrahydrofuran, water, methanol, and ethanol, which may be used alone or in combination. The reaction temperature may range from about −70° C. to 100° C., which is typically applied in a reaction, and preferably from −30° C. to 30° C. The deprotection reaction for removing the protecting group from the peptide may be carried out using an acid compound, a base compound, or a transition metal, capable of removing the protecting group without influencing the peptide bond, depending on the kind of protecting group. The deprotection reaction may be performed through acid treatment using, for example, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen fluoride, acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, trimethylchlorosilane, or mixtures thereof. When the deprotection reaction is carried out through acid treatment, it may be promoted by the addition of an adjuvant such as anisole, phenol or thioanisole. Alternatively, the deprotection reaction may be performed through base treatment using, for example, ammonia, diethylamine, hydrazine, morpholine, N-methylpyrrolidine, piperidine, sodium carbonate, or mixtures thereof. Alternatively, the deprotection reaction may be performed through transition metal treatment using, for example, zinc, mercury, palladium/hydrogen, etc. After completion of the reaction, the peptide may be purified using a typical peptide purification process, such as extraction, layer separation, solid precipitation, recrystallization, or column chromatography. Moreover, the peptide according to the present invention may be converted into a variant thereof or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof using a typical process.

 MODE FOR THE INVENTION A peptide or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention is not known. International Patent Publication No. WO2006/031330 A2 discloses beta-amyloid-related peptides, but all of these peptides are associated with the reduction or prevention of effects induced by the action of beta-amyloid alone, particularly the effects of inhibiting beta-amyloid-induced tau protein phosphorylation or neuronal cell death, and thus are known only as neuroprotective peptides. These neuroprotective peptides are known to inhibit beta-amyloid-induced effects such as neuronal cell death and tau phosphorylation. The effects of the neuroprotective peptides are different from the effect of inhibiting the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain according to the present invention. The present invention has an effect of inhibiting the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain and may thus exhibit high applicability because of the application without the need to pass through a blood-brain barrier (BBB), whereas the neuroprotective peptide has to pass through a blood-brain barrier (BBB) in order to exhibit intracerebral activity thereof. Ultimately, the neuroprotective peptide requires additional means for entry into the brain (e.g., a catheter inserted by neurosurgery, etc.) for the desired activity, but the present invention also has an unexpected effect from the neuroprotective peptide in that it requires no additional means for entry into the brain. Thus, the effect of the present invention is not only completely different from, but also unpredictable from, the effects of the peptides disclosed in International Publication No. WO 2006/031330 A2. Furthermore, as shown in the following test results, the neuroprotective peptides do not exhibit the effect of inhibiting entry of beta-amyloid into the brain, and thus it can be reconfirmed that the present invention is not only completely different from such peptides, but also has an unpredictable effect. A better understanding of the present invention is given through the following examples, comparative examples and preparation examples, wherein the examples and preparation examples are merely set forth to illustrate the present invention but are not to be construed as limiting the present invention. The reagents used in the following examples and the like are commercially available and best products, and are purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise mentioned. For the following test results, means and standard deviations were measured and statistical significance was assayed, as necessary. <Preparation of Peptide> The peptides shown in Table 1 below were prepared by AnyGen Co., Ltd., Korea. Specifically, these peptides were synthesized by a solid-phase method using the chemical properties of Fmoc (9-fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl). More specifically, a C-terminus of the peptide was bound to 0.55 mmol/g of a solid-phase resin (Wang resin; Sigma-Aldrich). The coupling of Fmoc-Phe-OH amino acid was carried out together with O-Benzotriazole-N,N,N′,N′-tetramethyl-uronium-hexafluoro-phosphate (HBTU). The amino acid side-chain was protected by tert-butyl and tert-butyloxycarbonyl. Deprotection and separation from the resin were performed at room temperature for 3 hr using a mixed solution comprising trifluoroacetic acid and water at a ratio of 95:5 (v/v). A crude peptide was repeatedly washed with diethylether, dried in a vacuum, and then purified via reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) using a Shimadzu 8 μm Shimpak ODS C18 column (20×250 mm). The purified peptide was identified via analytical RP-HPLC using a Shimpak 5 μm ODS C18 column (4.6×250 mm). The molecular weight of the synthesized peptide was measured using a matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-mass spectrometer (Axima CFR, Kratos Analytical, Manchester, UK).

 In Table 1, D designates aspartic acid (Asp), G designates glycine (Gly), E designates glutamic acid (Glu), F designates phenylalanine (Phe), A designates alanine (Ala), V designates valine (Val), K designates lysine (Lys), M designates methionine (Met), and R designates arginine (Arg). <Evaluation of Effect of Inhibiting Entry of Beta-Amyloid into Brain I> The inhibition of entry of blood beta-amyloid 1-42 into the brain by the peptide of Example 1 was experimentally verified. Specifically, in order to evaluate the effect of the peptide of Example 1 on inhibiting the entry of beta-amyloid 1-42 into the brain, which is the cause of Alzheimer's disease, 1 mg of beta-amyloid 1-42 (American Peptide Company, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) was added with 2 ml of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 days, and aliquoted at 100 μl each into tubes. After evaporation of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) using a speed vacuum, 10 μl of an anhydrous DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) solution was placed in one of the aliquoted tubes, so as to realize sufficient dissolution, after which 400 μl of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was added thereto, thus preparing a 25 μM beta-amyloid 1-42 solution. ICR mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me., USA) were divided into a normal group, a control group and two test groups. The respective test groups were intraperitoneally administered with the peptide of Example 1 in amounts of 2.5 mg/kg and 25 mg/kg, and the control group was treated in the same manner as in the test group, with the exception that an excipient (10% DMSO in saline, 10 ml/kg) was used in lieu of the peptide of Example 1. After 20 min, the control group and the test groups were intravenously (i.v.) injected through the tail vein with 400 μl of 25 μM beta-amyloid 1-42. Furthermore, the normal group was treated in the same manner as in the control group, with the exception that beta-amyloid 1-42 was not added. 10 min after the tail venous injection of beta-amyloid, about 50 μl of blood was collected from the infraorbital vein of each mouse using a sodium-heparinized capillary tube, after which the mouse was immediately subjected to euthanasia with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas and then the right hemisphere of the mouse was extracted and stored in liquid nitrogen. All the collected blood samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was isolated, placed in the prepared tube, and diluted at 1/4000, followed by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay or Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpecific Assay) ofbeta-amyloid 1-42. The frozen right hemisphere was added with 3 ml of a RIPA buffer (Radio Immuno Precipitation Assay buffer), sonicated, and centrifuged, after which the supernatant was isolated, followed by protein concentration measurement through BCA assay (bicinchoninic acid assay). BCA assay was performed in accordance with the kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass., USA, Cat. No. 23227) protocol. The beta-amyloid 1-42 concentration in the brain was measured through ELISA in a RIPA-homogenate. ELISA was performed in accordance with the kit (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany, Code No. 27711) protocol. The results are shown in FIG. 1. FIG. 1 is graphs showing the results of evaluation of the effect of inhibiting the entry of blood beta-amyloid into the brain according to an embodiment of the present invention, the left graph of FIG. 1 illustrating the results of measurement of the beta-amyloid concentration in the brain in the normal group, control group and two test groups (a test group administered with 2.5 mg/kg of peptide and a test group administered with 25 mg/kg of peptide), and the right graph thereof illustrating the results of measurement of the blood (plasma) beta-amyloid concentration. As shown therein, the beta-amyloid 1-42 concentrations in the brain were measured to be 195.5±5.6 pg/mg and 187.8±2.4 pg/mg in the test group intraperitoneally administered with 2.5 mg/kg of peptide of Example 1 and the test group intraperitoneally administered with 25 mg/kg of peptide of Example 1, respectively, indicating that the beta-amyloid level in the brain was decreased in a concentration-dependent manner compared to the control group. These results were considered statistically significant (p<0.01). On the other hand, the plasma beta-amyloid levels were not greatly different in any of the control and test groups. Consequently, the entry of blood beta-amyloid 1-42 into the brain might be inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by the peptide of Example 1. Therefore, the peptide of the present invention is capable of inhibiting the entry of blood beta-amyloid 1-42 into the brain, thus making it possible to treat and/or prevent Alzheimer's disease, dementia such as vascular dementia, alcoholic dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and/or inflammation of the brain. Diseases caused by the deposition of beta-amyloid introduced into the brain are known to be Alzheimer's disease, dementia such as vascular dementia, alcoholic dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, inflammation of the brain, and the like (Irvine G B, El-Agnaf O M, Shankar G M, Walsh D M. Protein aggregation in the brain: the molecular basis for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Mol Med. 2008; 14(7-8):451-64, etc.), and the peptide of the present invention is able to inhibit the entry of blood beta-amyloid 1-42 into the brain, thus enabling the treatment and/or prevention of such diseases. <Evaluation of Learning and Memory Recovery Effects Using Animal Models> The learning and memory recovery effects of the peptide of Example 1 were experimentally verified. Specifically, in order to evaluate the effect of the peptide of Example 1 on inhibiting learning and memory reduction, which are symptoms of Alzheimer's disease, 30-week-old double transgenic mouse (DTg mouse, Jackson Laboratory, USA) models having induced human Alzheimer's disease, obtained in a manner in which a human-derived gene of beta-amyloid precursor protein APP (APPsw; amyloid mutation) having Swedish mutation and a human-derived gene in the form of exon-9 deletion of a gamma secretase PSI gene were over-expressed in the brain through genetic manipulation, were used for tests. DTg mice are known to show amyloid plaques in the brain about 1.5 months after birth, with cognitive dysfunctions shown from 4-5 months (Oakley H, Cole S L, Logan S, Maus E, Shao P, Craft J, Guillozet-Bongaarts A, Ohno M, Disterhoft J, Van Eldik L, Berry R, Vassar R. “Intraneuronal beta-amyloid aggregates, neurodegeneration, and neuron loss in transgenic mice with five familial Alzheimer's disease mutations: potential factors in amyloid plaque formation.” J Neurosci. 2006 Oct. 4; 26(40):10129-40), and were used as animal models to determine whether the peptide of Example 1 exhibits learning and memory recovery effects. The test animals were acclimated in an animal room after purchase in accordance with the Guidelines for Experimental Animal Tests and treated in accordance with the approved Animal Experimental Plan. The test conditions were maintained at a temperature of 23±1° C. and a humidity of 50±5%, and the light/dark cycle was 12 hr (07:00 lighting off-19:00 lighting on). During the testing, animals were free to consume water and feed. The test animals were divided into two groups of 10 animals each, one group being the control group and the other group being the test group. In the test group, the peptide of Example 1 was intraperitoneally administered at a dose of 50 mg/kg using a syringe once a day, 5 times a week, for a total of 13 weeks. The control group was treated in the same manner as in the test group, with the exception that an excipient (10% DMSO in saline, 10 ml/kg) was used in lieu of the peptide of Example 1. 10 weeks after the administration of the peptide of Example 1, a behavioral test (Y-maze test) was performed once. The Y-maze test is an experiment to observe the voluntary tendency of an animal to search a new environment using short-term memory ability. The test was conducted by placing the animal in the center of a maze and allowing it to move freely in the maze for 8 min to thus visually observe and record the order in which the animal enters each branch. Spontaneous alternation (%) was calculated using the following equation. 

Spontaneous alternation (%)={(actual alternation number)/(total alternation number−2)}×100
 The actual alternation number was incremented by one when the animal entered three different branches in succession without repeating a branch. Statistical processing of test results was performed using the SPSS program (IBM SPSS Statistics). Statistical significance was assayed for the control group versus the test group (administered with the peptide of Example 1) using an unpaired t-test. Significance was accepted at p<0.05 and p<0.01. The results are shown in FIG. 2. FIG. 2 is a graph showing the results of evaluation of the effect on animal learning and memory recovery according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 2, the spontaneous alternation values were measured to be 49.44±3.88% in the control group and 63.22±2.56% in the test group administered with the peptide of Example 1. In the test group administered with the peptide of Example 1, the learning and memory effects were recovered significantly (P<0.01). Therefore, the peptide of Example 1 can be concluded to be effective at recovering learning and memory. Consequently, the treatment and/or prevention of Alzheimer's disease, dementia such as vascular dementia, alcoholic dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, and the like which are treated and/or prevented through learning and memory recovery are deemed to be possible through learning and memory recovery by means of the peptide of the present invention. <Evaluation of Effect of Changing Biomarker in Animal Models> In order to evaluate the effect of changing the biomarker using animal models in which an administration period of a total of 13 weeks was terminated in the <Evaluation of learning and memory recovery effects using animal models> test, the following test was conducted. After termination of intraperitoneal administration for a total of 13 weeks, the animal models were subjected to euthanasia using carbon dioxide (CO2) and the brain thereof was immediately extracted. Upon brain extraction, the entire brain was taken out so as not to be scratched, and was then lightly washed with saline solution. The brain hemispheres were separated from each other using a surgical scalpel, and the left hemisphere was placed in a prepared EP tube (EpPendorf tube), rapidly cooled in liquid nitrogen, and stored in a deep freezer at −80° C. until the next experiment. The left hemisphere stored in a deep freezer at −80° C. was placed in a RIPA buffer (Radio Immuno Precipitation Assay buffer) and sonicated, thus preparing a brain homogenate. Thereafter, the amount of protein was measured through BCA assay (BicinChoninic Acid assay). BCA assay was performed in accordance with the kit (Thermo Scientific, saltham, MA, USA, Cat. No. 23227) protocol. The biomarker expression level was measured through ELISA, and ELISA assay was performed in accordance with the kit{Amyloid-beta(1-42) Elisa kit: IBL International, Hamburg, Germany (27711), TNF-alpha ELISA kit: Koma Biotech, Seoul, Korea (K0331186P), GFAP Elisa kit: Millipore Corporation, Billerica, Mass., USA (NS830)} protocol. After completion of all the reactions, the OD (Optical Density) value of the sample was measured at 450 nm using a spectrophotometer and the concentration was calculated using a quantitative analysis program. The biomarkers measured through ELISA were beta-amyloid 1-42, TNF-alpha, and GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein). The biomarker expression level measured through ELISA was determined by calculating the mean value and standard deviation in each of the control group and the test group (a group administered with 50 mg/kg peptide of Example 1). The results are shown in FIGS. 3 to 5. FIG. 3 is a graph showing the results of evaluation of the effect of reducing beta-amyloid 1-42 according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 3, the beta-amyloid 1-42 concentration of the control group was measured to be 76.03±25.63 ng/mg protein, and the beta-amyloid 1-42 concentration of the test group was measured to be 57.56±28.47 ng/mg protein, which was slightly decreased compared to the control group. FIG. 4 is a graph showing the results of evaluation of the effect of reducing TNF-alpha according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 4, the TNF-alpha concentration of the control group was measured to be 1109.91±285.30 pg/mg protein, and the TNF-alpha concentration of the test group was measured to be 798.99±172.90 pg/mg protein, which was decreased statistically significantly (p<0.05) compared to the control group. TNF-alpha is an inflammatory factor, the reduction of which may be interpreted to mean the inhibition of inflammation. Based on these results, the peptide of Example 1 can be concluded to inhibit inflammation of the brain. FIG. 5 is a graph showing the results of evaluation of the effect of reducing GFAP according to an embodiment of the present invention. As shown in FIG. 5, in the astrocyte marker GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein), the GFAP concentration of the control group was measured to be 70.61±26.82 ng/mg protein, and the GFAP concentration of the test group was measured to be 47.63±24.92 ng/mg protein, which was slightly reduced compared to the control group. Based on the biomarker test results, upon the long-term administration of the peptide of Example 1, it can be confirmed that the beta-amyloid level in the brain is reduced and that the inflammatory response is suppressed. This change in biomarker is also deemed to support the results of improvement of the learning and memory recovery in animals using the peptide of Example 1. Based on the above results, the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention is capable of treating and/or preventing Alzheimer's disease, dementia such as vascular dementia, alcoholic dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and/or inflammation of the brain, and the treatment and/or prevention thereof can be found to be due to the inhibition of entry of beta-amyloid into the brain, inhibition of deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain and/or inhibition of inflammation of the brain. <Evaluation of Effect of Inhibiting Entry of Beta-Amyloid into Brain II> Based on the test results of Example 1, the following test was conducted in order to evaluate whether Example 2 and Comparative Examples 1 and 2, in addition to Example 1, are effective at inhibiting the entry of beta-amyloid 1-42 into the brain. The peptide of Example 2 is a peptide (DGEF) consisting of four amino acids obtained by excluding terminal F from the peptide of Example 1, the peptide of Comparative Example 1 is a peptide consisting of the key amino acid sequence (DAEF) among neuroprotective peptides disclosed in International Publication No. WO 2006/031330 A2, and the peptide of Comparative Example 2 is a peptide having the greatest effect among neuroprotective peptides known to comprise the corresponding amino acid sequence. Specifically, 1 mg ofbeta-amyloid 1-42 (American Peptide Company, Sunnyvale, Calif., USA) was added with 2 ml of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP), allowed to stand at room temperature for 3 days, and aliquoted at 100 μl each into tubes. After evaporation of hexafluoroisopropanol (HFIP) using a speed vacuum, 10 μl of an anhydrous DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide) solution was placed in one of the aliquoted tubes, so as to realize sufficient dissolution, after which 400 μl of phosphate buffer saline (PBS) was added thereto, thus preparing a 25 μM beta-amyloid 1-42 solution. ICR mice (The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, Me., USA) were divided into a normal group, a control group and four test groups. The respective test groups were intraperitoneally administered with the peptide of each of Example 1, Example 2, Comparative Example 1, and Comparative Example 2 in amounts of 25 mg/kg, and the control group was treated in the same manner as in the test group, with the exception that an excipient (10% DMSO in saline, 10 ml/kg) was used in lieu of the peptide. After 20 min, the control group and the test groups were intravenously (i.v.) injected through the tail vein with 400 μl of 25 μM beta-amyloid 1-42. Furthermore, the normal group was treated in the same manner as in the control group, with the exception that beta-amyloid 1-42 was not added. 10 min after the tail venous injection of beta-amyloid, about 50 μl of blood was collected from the infraorbital vein of each mouse using a sodium-heparinized capillary tube, after which the mouse was immediately subjected to euthanasia with carbon dioxide (CO2) gas and then the right hemisphere of the mouse was extracted and stored in liquid nitrogen. All the collected blood samples were centrifuged at 13,000 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant was isolated, placed in the prepared tube, and diluted at 1/4000, followed by ELISA (Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSorbent Assay or Enzyme-Linked ImmunoSpecific Assay) ofbeta-amyloid 1-42. The frozen right hemisphere was added with 3 ml of a RIPA buffer (Radio Immuno Precipitation Assay buffer), sonicated, and centrifuged, after which the supernatant was isolated, followed by protein concentration measurement through BCA assay (bicinchoninic acid assay). BCA assay was performed in accordance with the kit (Thermo Scientific, Waltham, Mass., USA, Cat. No. 23227) protocol. The beta-amyloid 1-42 concentration in the brain was measured through ELISA in a RIPA-homogenate. ELISA was performed in accordance with the kit (IBL International, Hamburg, Germany, Code No. 27711) protocol. The results are shown in Table 2 below.

 As is apparent from Table 2, the peptide of Example 2 effectively inhibited the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain, like the peptide of Example 1. As the peptide of Example 1, the peptide of Example 2 was able to inhibit the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain to thus suppress the deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain. Consequently, the peptide of Example 2 is also deemed to enable the treatment and/or prevention of Alzheimer's disease, dementia such as vascular dementia, alcoholic dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and/or inflammation of the brain, associated with the deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain, and such treatment and/or prevention can be found to be due to inhibition of entry of beta-amyloid into the brain, inhibition of deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain and/or inhibition of inflammation of the brain. However, the peptides of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 did not inhibit the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain, unlike the peptide of Example 1. Accordingly, the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention can be concluded to exhibit effects quite different from those of known neuroprotective peptides. Consequently, the present invention can be easily applied because the intracerebral action of beta-amyloid can be inhibited even without additional means for passing through a blood-brain barrier. Moreover, the present invention is capable of inhibiting the intracerebral action of beta-amyloid fundamentally, and can be more directly applied in association with inhibition of the intracerebral action of beta-amyloid, and thus exhibits high applicability. <Evaluation of Effect of Inhibiting Entry of Beta-Amyloid into Brain III> The binding of the peptides of Examples 1 and 2 to RAGE was evaluated through the following test, whereby the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain was confirmed to be inhibited through suppression of the binding of beta-amyloid to RAGE. This is based on the fact that RAGE (Receptor for Advanced Glycation End products), which is expressed on the endothelial cell membrane of the blood-brain barrier, plays a role in transporting beta-amyloid to the brain, and also on the fact that inhibitors for inhibiting the binding of RAGE and beta-amyloid have therapeutic or preventive effects on Alzheimer's disease, cognitive disorder, or dementia, associated with the deposition of beta-amyloid protein in the brain tissues (Neurology. 2004 Jun. 8; 62(11):1984-1989; J Clin Invest. 2012 April; 122(4):1377-1392 etc.). Specifically, the binding capacity of the peptide of Example 1 or 2 to RAGE was measured using MST (Microscale Thermophoresis). Using a kit {Monolith NT™ Protein Labeling Kit RED-NHS (L001, NanoTemper Technologies)}, an extracellular domain recombinant protein RAGE (11629-H08H, Sino Biological Inc.) was bound to a RED fluorescent dye NT-647-NHS and then purified. Thereafter, a RAGE solution in which the concentration of the RED fluorescent dye NT-647-NHS labeled RAGE in an MST buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM MgCl2, 0.05% Tween-20) solution was 20 μM was prepared. Also, a peptide solution was prepared in a 16-step dilution series, in which dilution was repeated with the MST buffer until the concentration of the peptide of Example 1 or Example 2 became 1.52 nM starting from 50 μM. Thereafter, the RAGE solution and the peptide solution were mixed in amounts of 100 μl each, injected into a capillary tube and then placed in the order of concentration in a Monolith NT. 115 tray (G009, NanoTemper technologies). The software was operated in accordance with the Monolith NT. 115 operating method. The same procedure was repeated three times, and the mean value of Kd (dissociation constant) was obtained. Consequently, the Kd between the RAGE and the peptide of Example 1 was 76.86 nM and the Kd between the RAGE and the peptide of Example 2 was 80.89 nM, indicating that both of the peptides of Examples 1 and 2 were coupled with RAGE to thus suppress the binding of beta-amyloid and RAGE, thereby inhibiting the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain. In conclusion, the peptide of the present invention is capable of suppressing the binding of RAGE and beta-amyloid, thus inhibiting the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain, whereby the intracerebral action of beta-amyloid can be prevented fundamentally. Therefore, the peptide or pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof according to the present invention is deemed to enable the treatment and/or prevention of Alzheimer's disease, dementia such as vascular dementia, alcoholic dementia and dementia with Lewy bodies, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and/or inflammation of the brain, associated with the deposition of beta-amyloid in the brain. Moreover, the present invention can be more directly and easily applied in association with inhibition of the intracerebral action of beta-amyloid, and thus exhibits high applicability. Preparation Example Preparation of a Dosage Form for Injection 500 mg of a peptide prepared in the same manner as in Example 1 or 2 was dissolved in saline solution to make 10 ml of a solution. This solution was charged in an ampoule for an injection, yielding a dosage form for injection of Preparation Example 1 or 2. INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY The present invention is effective at inhibiting the entry of beta-amyloid into the brain. Also, the present invention can be more easily applied in association with inhibition of the intracerebral action of beta-amyloid, thus exhibiting high applicability. Therefore, the present invention is industrially applicable.

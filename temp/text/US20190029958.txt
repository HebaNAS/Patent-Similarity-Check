other disorder, that requires topical application of a drug,
Cosmetic products are intended for beautifying the skin and
improving its appearance,

[0063] Cosmetic and medical disorders that are best
treated using the alcohol-free foam carrier and the alcohol-
free cosmetic or pharmaceutical product are identiﬁed, and
the advantages of such carrier and products is demonstrated
as compared to currently available options.

[0064] The foam of the present invention is advantageous
to current options, for one or more of the following reasons:

[0065] (1) The foam is lightweight and thus, economi-
cal;

[0066] (2) The foam contains a hydrophobic solvent, in
any desirable concentration, which provides a refatting
and skin soothing effect, as well as a carrier for
hydrophobic active agents;

[0067] (3) The foam contains silicone oil in a therapeu-
tically effective concentration;

[0068] (4) The foam includes active agent, both water
soluble and oil soluble;

[0069] (5) The foam is easily spreadable, allowing
treatment of large areas such as the arms, back, legs and
the breast;

[0070] (6) Due to its ﬂow properties, it spreads effec-
tively into folds and wrinkles, providing uniform dis-
tribution of the active agent without the need of exten-
sive rubbing and absorbs into the skin; and

[0071] (7) In certain formulations the foam is ﬂame
retardant or ﬂame resistant and in certain more speciﬁc
embodiments it does not ignite.

[0072] Certain emulsions of the present invention surpris-
ingly display the additional inherent property of being ﬂame
retardant or resistant, although the propellant is itself highly
ﬂammable. As the foamed composition according to one or
more embodiments may spread over large surface areas, the
attributes of ﬂame retardancy or ﬂame resistant is particu-
larly desirable,

[0073] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, foamable carrier composition comprises:

[0074] about 2% to about 75% by weight hydrophobic
solvent, said hydrophobic solvent comprising at least
one ofmineral oil, MCT oil, isopropyl oil, octyl dode-
canol silicone oil and vegetable oil;

[0075] about 25 to about 98% by weight water;

[0076] about 0.1% to about 5% by weight foam adju-
vant agent;

[0077] about 011% to about 5% by weight surface-

active agent;

[0078] about 0.1% to about 5% by weight water gelling
agent; and
[0079] a liqueﬁed or compressed gas propellant,

wherein the resultant foam is non-ﬂammable, ﬂame

retardant or ﬂame resistant,
[0080] In certain embodiments of the present invention,
the foamable carrier composition is ﬂame retardant or resis-
tant. More speciﬁcally, ﬂame retardant, ﬂame resistant or
non-ﬂammable canier compositions include a hydrophobic
solvent comprising at least one of mineral oil, medium chain
triglyceride (MCT) oil, isopropyl myristate, octyl dodeca-
nol, silicone oil and soybean oil. Mineral oil, particularly
light mineral oil is classiﬁed by manufacturers as a com-
bustible material, Surprisingly, foamable compositions con-
taining substantial amounts of mineral oil provide a foam

using non ﬂammble propellants Moreover it is effective
even at high concentrations when there is phase reversal
where the emulsion transitions form an oil in water emulsion
to a water in oil emulsion,

[0081] Vegetable oil, particularly soybean oil is classiﬁed
by manufacturers as a combustible material, Soybean oil is
used in candles. Surprisingly, foamable compositions con-
taining substantial amounts of soybean oil provide a foam
with ﬂame resistant or retardant properties without using
non ﬂammble propellants. Moreover it is effective even at
higher concentrations.

[0082] Medium chain triglycerides (MCT’s) also classi-
ﬁed by manufacturers as combustible materials, provide the
resultant foam with ﬂame resistant or retardant properties.
MCT formulations demonstrated ﬂame retardance and ﬂame
resistance up to about their phase reversal limit. MCT
foamable compositions containing MCT oil above the phase
reversal composition; eg., the composition becomes a water
in oil emulsion are, thought less effective in retarding
ﬂammability.

[0083] Silicone oil, particularly dimethicone, is classiﬁed
by manufacturers as a combustible material, Soybean oil is
used in candles. Surprisingly, foamable compositions con-
taining substantial amounts of soybean oil provide a foam
with ﬂame resistant or retardant properties without using
non ﬂammble propellants. Moreover it is effective even at
signiﬁcant concentrations.

[0084] Foamable compositions containing isopropyl
myristate or ocytel dodecanol can provide the resultant foam
with ﬂame resistant or retardant properties. However, such
oil like substances are more sensitive to the type of inﬂam-
mable propellant mixture used. One possible way of reduc-
ing such sensitivity is to use a mixture of inﬂammable and
non-ﬂammable propellants. A non-limiting example is
butane and dymel, although many other mixtures could be
used. Using non-ﬂammable propellants increases the ﬂame
retardant and resistant properties of the present invention,
[0085] In one or more embodiments the hydrophobic
solvent is mineral oil and preferably light mineral oil.

tion, combinations of two or more of a mineral oil, MCT oil,

water, propylene glycol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, poly-
sorbate 60, citric acid, and potassium citrate, and pressurized
with a hydrocarbon propellant.

[0027] Cortifoam, a hydrocortisone acetate rectal foam is
produced by Schwartz Pharrna GmbH, wherein the hydro-
cortisone is present at 10% in a foam vehicle Nonmedicinal
ingredients of Cortifoam include cetyl alcohol, ethoxylated
stearyl alcohol, methylparaben, polyoxyetliylene-IO stearyl
ether, propylene glycol, propylparaben, triethanolamine,
water, and inert propellants, isobutene, and propane.

[0028] Thus, foam compositions for topical treatment,
containing higher concentrations of oils, but which do not
comprise alcohol are still desirable. Foam compositions that
are robust and suitable for inclusion of a wide range ofactive
ingredients are desired. Furthermore, foam compositions for
topical treatment containing oils and particularly higher
concentrations of oils, which are ﬂame retardant are desir-
able.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0029] Despite the commonly known fact that hydropho-
bic solvents are diﬂicult to formulate into a lather-producing
or foam-producing product and that addition of conventional
hydrophobic solvents interferes with the lather forming
ability of the surfactant, we have surprisingly discovered a
series of foamable carrier compositions, which, upon admix-
ing with a liqueﬁed gas propellant in an aerosol container,
produces a foamable composition that is suitable for topical
administration. Upon discharge from an aerosol container,
the composition forms a breakable foam, which is rich and
creamy in appearance, and show very ﬁne bubble structure.
The foam does not break down immediately upon discharge,
however, it collapses to spread easily onto a skin area upon
slight rubbing.

[0030] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the alcohol-free cosmetic or pharmaceutical foamable
carrier composition includes water, a liquid, non-volatile
hydrophobic solvent, a foam adjuth agent selected from
the group consisting of fatty acids and fatty alcohols, a
surface-active agent and a water gelling agent. Such foam-
able carriers, when placed in an aerosol container and
combined with a liqueﬁed gas propellant, create an oil in
water emulsion, which, upon release from the aerosol con-
tainer, provides a therapeutically beneﬁcial foam product.
The foam retains its structure for a time suﬁicient for a user
to apply and to rub the foam into the skin. The foam has a
very low yield strength and, hence, it breaks upon touch and
makes rubbing easy and eﬂicient, and its application even.
[0031] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the foamable carrier composition the hydrophobic
solvent content is about 2-5% and has a composition as
follows:

[0032] Class A Composition:

[0033] about 2-5% hydrophobic solvent;
[0034] about 80-98% water;
[0035] about 011% to 5% foam adjuvant agent;
[0036] about 0.1% to 5% surface-active agent; and
[0037] about 0.1% to 5% water gelling agent.
[0038] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-

tion, the foamable composition the hydrophobic solvent
content is about 5-10% and has a composition as follows:

[0057] aaout 0.1% to 5% surface-active agent; and

[0058] aaout 0.1% to 5% water gelling agent.
[0059] All % values are provided on a weight (w/w) basis,
based on the composition without propellant (unless other-
wise speciﬁed).
[0060] The cosmetic or pharmaceutical foamable carrier
composition is liquid. The foamable of the present invention
does not contain short chain aliphatic alcohols, making it
non-irritating and non-drying. Alcohols penetrate the skin’s
protective barrier and break down the intercellular matrix. In
a recent publication by the American Academy of Derma-
tology (AAD), titled “Facing the Facts about Skin Care
Products" it is stated “[i]ndividuals with dry skin should
avoid astringents and any product with alcohol because they
easily strip away moisture from the skin” (see: wwwiaad.
org/PressReleases FacingFactshtml). Another AAD publi-
cation, titled “Sensitive About Your Skin?” recommends to
“[a]void solvents that penetrate the skin including propylene
glycol and ethanol” (see:WWW.aad.oryPrcssReleases/sensi-
tive.htm1).
[0061] The alcohol-free foam carrier is formulated as an
oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion, so that it is suitable for
inclusion of either water-soluble and oil soluble active
agents (or both). The foamable carrier composition of the
present invention, when admixed with a propellant sub-
stance in an amount of about 5-25% by weight of the total
composition in an aerosol container, produces lightweight
breakable foam, suitable for facile application onto the skin,
and other body areas, which may accept topically-applied
products. Since the propellant, in the pressurized container
is in liquid state, upon admixing the foamable carrier com-
position with the propellant, a stable emulsion, comprising
the oil and the propellant (jointly as the “oil phase” com-
ponent of such emulsion) is formed.
[0062] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, an alcohol-free cosmetic or pharmaceutical product is
provided. The product includes a foam carrier composition
according to one or more embodiments of the present
invention and an active cosmetic or pharmaceutical ingre-
dient in a therapeutically effective concentration. Cosmetic
and pharmaceutical agents can be included in each of the
compositions described above and in the detailed description
that follows. Pharmaceutical products are intended for topi-
cal treatment of human and animal skin disorders, or any

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0002] The invention relates to an alcohol-free, cosmetic
or pharmaceutical foam carrier and its use. More speciﬁ-
cally, the invention relates to a cosmetic or phamiaceutical
foam carrier suitable for inclusion of both water soluble and
oil soluble pharmaceutical and cosmetic agents.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] External topical administration is an important
route for the administration of drugs in disease treatment. n
external topical administration, the drug is absorbed into
and/or through skin, mucous membrane or wound tissue.
Many groups of drugs, including. for example, antibiotic,
anti-fungal, anti-inﬂammatory, anesthetic, analgesic, anti-
allergic, corticosteroid, retinoid and anti-proliferative mec i-
cations are preferably administered in hydrophobic media,
e.g. ointments or oils. However, due to the undesirabe
consistency of these hydrophobic caniers, their use is lim-
ited, For instance, ointments containing white petrolatum,
e,g., Vaseline petroleum jelly, as the carrier oﬁen form an
impermeable barrier, so that metabolic products and excreta
from the wounds to which they are applied are not easi y
removed or drained away. Furthermore, it is difﬁcult for the
active drug dissolved in the carrier to pass through the white
petrolatum barrier layer into the wound tissue, so the e,,,-
cacy of the drug is reduced,
[0004] In addition, ointments and creams often do not
create an environment for promoting respiration of tie
wound tissue and it is not favorable to the normal respiration
of the skin, An additional disadvantage of petroleum jel y-
based products relates to the greasy feeling leﬁ following
their topical application onto the skin, mucosa] membranes
and wounds, Besides petroleum jelly, hydrophobic pharma-
ceutical carriers now in use include liquid paraﬂin, lanolin,
beeswax, vegetable oil, glycerin monostearate, higher alco-
hols, polyethylene glycol and some emulsifying agents,
which also have undesirable flow properties and skin feel.
[0005] Several hydrophobic liquid and semi-solid oils,
e.g., mono- and poly-unsaturated oils from vegetable and
marine sources, mineral oils, silicone oils, and liquid hydro-
phobic plant-derived oils, are known for their therapeutic
beneﬁts when applied topically, yet, their application in
liquid fomi is not practical. Oils can also contain essential
nutritional constituents, such as oil-soluble vitamins (e.g.,
vitaminA and vitamin E), minerals and other therapeutically
beneﬁcial constituents. Another class of therapeutic oils
includes mineral and silicon oils useful for the treatment of

 

Jan. 31, 2019

skin dehydration and other medical disorders, which oils are
liquid at ambient temperature. Such therapeutic oils unfor-
tunately, cannot be applied by users in amounts suﬁicient to
exert therapeutic affects because they typically are liquid at
use temperatures.

[0006] Other pharmaceutical active ingredients are water-
soluble and require a water component in the carrier.
[0007] While semi-solid cosmetic and pharmaceutical for-
mulations, such as creams, lotions, gels and ointments are
commonly used by consumers, new forms are desirable, in
order to achieve better control of the application, while
maintaining or bestowing the skin beneﬁcial properties of
such products. Thus, the development of a new composition,
having breakable foam consistency when extruded out of a
container and liquid properties when applied onto the skin is
advantageous, Ideally a foam should contain hydrophobic
substances (solvents), which can act as emollients and
provide the skin with soothing and nourishing properties.
However, such hydrophobic solvents are diﬂicult to formu-
late into a lather-producing or foam-producing product
because the hydrophobic solvents interfere with the lather
forming ability of the surfactant. Furthermore, addition of
oils and other emollients to topical formulations can result in
an unpleasant or annoying skin residue.

[0008] Use of emulsions in foam compositions is known,
Emulsion systems provide a two-phase system including
Iipophilic or hydrophobic components in one phase and
hydrophilic components in the second phase, The foamed
emulsion typically is an oil-in-water emulsion in which the
hydrophobic component is dispersed in the aqueous con-
tinuous phase, Surfactants for reducing surface tension and
emulsiﬁers for improving foam stability are included in the
foam composition.

[0009] Foams and, in particular, foam emulsions are com-
plicated systems which do not form under all circumstances,
Slight shifts in foam emulsion composition, such as by the
addition of active ingredients, may destabilize the foam.
Furthermore, many emulsions do not provide the high foam
capacity, foam stability and/or fast-breaking action under
stress or temperatures that are desired in a topical foam
composition.

[0010] Aparticularly desirable type of oil-containing foam
is such wherein all or part of the oil phase comprises silicone
oil. Silicone oil is known for its skin protective features and
its incorporation in topical products is beneﬁcial. However,
it is not obvious to produce silicone oil-based foams, since
many silicone oils possess anti-foaming properties.

[0011] US. Pat. No, 6,126,920 discloses treatment of
various skin diseases, and in particular, scalp psoriasis, using
a foamable pharmaceutical composition containing a corti-
costeroid active substance, an aliphatic alcohol, water, a
fatty alcohol, a surface-active agent, a propellant and a
buffering agent. The foamable composition contains 40-90%
w/w composition of an aliphatic alcohol. US, Pat. No.
6,126,920 is typical of many compositions that use aliphatic
alcohols in the foam composition. The alcohol promotes fast
drying and thereby attempts to address the sticky feeling left
by many topical formulations after application; however,
alcohols, and in particular the methyl, ethyl and isopropyl
alcohols preferred in the ’920 patent, are defatting agents
and may cause skin to become dry and cracked. Hence, the
presence of aliphatic alcohol in a therapeutic foam for
external topical administration as taught in US Pat. No.
6,126,920 is undesirable.
US 2019/0029958 A1

[0012] US. Pat. No, 5,536,743 to Borgman describes a
buffered non-ﬂowing composition suitable for the treatment
of bacterial vaginosis which contains metronidazole. Suit-
able formulations include oil-in-water emulsions including
an internal oil phase of about 10-40 wt % oil and anionic,
cationic or nonionic surfactants. Suitable components of the
oleaginous phase include long chain alcohols, esters, and
acids, vegetable and animal oils and waxes, No other
stabilizing agents are disclosed for use in foam aerosol
compositions.

[0013] EP Patent No. 0598412 describes a composition
that is useful for skin protection against drying and harsh
environmental substances. The protection is derived from
the inclusion of poly(tetraﬂuoroethylene) (PTFE) in the
composition. The composition includes low levels of both
hydrophilic emollients and hydrophobic emollients. The
compositions include high levels of surfactants, including
ionic surfactants, and co-emulsiﬁers resulting in thick emul-
sions which are not ﬂowable, and thus providing products
which are inefficient foamers (or non-foaming) and too thick
for spreading over large skin areas.

[0014] US. Pat. No. 6,423,323 describes anaqueous foam
emulsion. The composition includes a hydrophobic phase
including fatty acids, emulsiﬁers and co-emulsiﬁers, and an
aqueous phase containing hydrophilic moisturizers and
emulsiﬁers. An optional ingredient according to U.S. Pat.
No. 6,423,323 is one or more refatting substances, in pref-
erable concentrations of 0.5 to 2%, if the product is to be
used for normal skin; and 3 to 6% for dry skin. Addition of
high levels of co-emulsiﬁers such as fatty alcohols and fatty
acids suggest that the foam is not stable. No other stabilizing
agents are disclosed.

[0015] US. Pat. No, 5,635,469 describes a foamable
cleansing liquid composition comprising about 005% to
about 10% of an emollient, in addition to cleansing surfac-
tants, humectants and water soluble cationic or nonionic
polymers, but no propellants. Low density foams are
achieved using a novel non-aerosol foam dispenser. The
foaming is achieved by operating a manual pump, which is
not convenient for operation. Emollients and humectants are
included to improve the level of hydration and/or lipid
content of the skin. However, the patent notes that emol-
lients and humectants interfere with the lather forming
ability of the surfactant.

[0016] US. Pat. No. 6,113,888 teaches a single water
phase composition comprising a self-tanning agent, a nitro-
gen-free polymer, a nitrogen-free surfactant. and water.
[0017] US. Pat. No. 5,679,324 to Lisboa pertains to an
aerosol foamable fragrance composition, translucent in its
pre-dispensed state, which forms a fast breaking foam.
Apparently the foam breaks spontaneously upon discharging
from an aerosol container (with no need of any rubbing or
sheer force application), thus, making is impractical for
spreading over a skin surface. The composition contains
surfactant, a propellant, a fragrance, a thickener, and a
cosmetic vehicle (preferably water) wherein the ratio of the
surfactant to propellant is from about 1:1 to about 1:10.
Emollients including silicone oils, mineral oils and hydro-
carbon oils may be included.

[0018] US. Pat. No, 6,251,369 discloses foamable dental
ﬂuoride compositions containing a water-soluble ﬂuoride
component, whereby said compositions include an oil in
water emulsion. However, the patent fails to specify the
identity or concentration of the oil component of the emul-

Jan. 31, 2019

sion; and none of the compositions presented in the
examples contain any oil component.

[0019] U.S. Pat. No. 5,961,957 describes a barrier foam
composition comprising from 70 to 90% of water, from 7 to
9% of butane, from 2 to 4% of glyceryl monostearate, from
1.5 to 3.50% of dimethicorie copolyol (a water-soluble
silicone compound), from 1 to 3% of propane, from 0.5 to
2.5% of lanolin, from 0.5 to 2.5% of stearic acid and from
0.05 to 1.05% of at least one of methylchloroisothiazolinone
and methylisothiazolinone.

[0020] US. Patent Publication No. 2006/238646 Bl dis-
closes aqueous aerosol compositions for delivery of atom-
ized oil as an atomised spray where the propellant is water
soluble. The water based system is described as non-ﬂam-
mable. No foam is taught or exempliﬁed.

[0021] U.S. Pat. No. 3,419,658 describes nonaqueous
aerosol foams containing mineral oil and suggests using
non-ﬂammable propellants because of their lack of ﬂamma-
bility.

[0022] US. Pat. No. 2,524,590 discloses an atomized oil
emulsion spray with an emulsifying agent that preferably
tends to suppress foam formation or is not foam forming.
The gas stream is said to be practically non-inﬂammable due
to presence of water particles and vapour in stream. The
patent teaches away from foam formation.

[0023] Foams are considered a more convenient vehicle
for topical delivery of active agents. There are several types
of topical foams, including aqueous foams, such as com-
monly available shaving foams; hydroalcoholic foams, such
as described in US. Pat. No. 6,126,920; emulsion-based
foams, comprising oil and water components, such as
described in US. Pat. No. 6,730,288 and PCT Application
No. WO 2004/037225; and oleaginous foams, which consist
of high oil content, such as described in US Patent Publi-
cation No, US 2005/0031547. In skin therapy, oil containing
foams are preferred, since oil contribute to skin protection
and moisturization, which improve the therapeutic effect of
the formulation. Typically foams are made using liqueﬁed
hydrocarbon gas propellant, such a spropane, butane and
isobutane, which are inﬂammable. The combination of the
oil component of an oil-containing foam and a hydrocarbon
propellant results in a foam that is typically inﬂammable. In
several countries inﬂammable foams cannot be used, and in
Europe there is a formal standard, namely European Stan-
dard prEN 1485], titled “Aerosol containersiAerosol foam
ﬂammability test” which deﬁnes criteria to assess the
inﬂammability of foam products.

[0024] One approach to avoid this problem is to use
alternative halogenated propellants, such as chloro-ﬂuoro
carbons (CFCs) and hydroﬂuorocarbon (HFC) propellants;
however, CFCs are know as ozone-depleting propellants and
HFCs are expensive, making their use impractical in the case
of consumer products and drugs.

[0025] A few dermatological foam products are available
on the market.
[0026] OluxTM Foam, produced by Connetics, Inc., con-

tains clobetasol propionate. Each gram of OluxTM Foam
contains 0.5 mg clobetasol propionate, USP, in a thermola-
bile foam, which consists of ethanol (60%), puriﬁed water,
propylene glycol, cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol, polysorbate
60, citric acid, and potassium citrate. It is dispensed from an
aluminum can pressurized with a hydrocarbon propellant
(propane/butane). LuxigTM is another corticostroid foam
medication, containing 1.2 mg betamethasone valerate per

[0294] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-

tion, the foam composition of the present invention is useﬁil
in the therapy of non-dermatological disorders, which
respond to u'ansdermal delivery of an active agent, By way
of example, such disorders include localized pain in general,
as well as joint pain, muscle pain, back pain, rheumatic pain,
arthritis, ostheoarthritis and acute soft tissue injuries and
sports injuries, Other disorders of this class include condi-
tions, which respond to hormone therapy, such as hormone
replacement therapy, transdermal nicotine administration.
and other respective disorders, known in the art of drug
delivery. The foam composition of the present invention is
also useful in the delivery of local anesthetic agentsi

Active Pharmaceutical Agents (Drugs)

[0295] The active pharmaceutical agents. also referred to
as “drug(s)", may consist of a single drug or a combination
of drugs that can be dissolved in the water phase or the
hydrophobic phase of the carrier composition. Examples of
such drugs are antibiotic, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral,
antiinﬂammatory, anesthetic, analgesic, antiallergic, corti-
costeroid, retinoid and antiproliferative medications and
mixtures thereof at any proportion. The concentration of
drugs may be adopted to exert a therapeutic effect on a
disease when applied to an afﬂicted areal

Antibacterial Agents

[0296] One important class of drugs comprises antibacte-
rial agents. It is well known that bacterial infections are
involved in a variety of superﬁcial disorders of the skin, eye,
mucosal membrane, oral cavity, vagina and rectum

[0297] The antibacterial drug can be active against gram
positive and gram-negative bacteria, protozoa, aerobic bac-
teria and unaerobic onesi

[0298] By way of example, the antibacterial drugs can be
selected from the group of chloramphenicol, tetracyclines,
synthetic and semi-synthesic penicillins, beta-lactames, qui-
nolones, ﬂuoroquinolnes, macrolide antibiotics, metronida-
zlole and its derivatives and analogs, dicarboxylic acids,
such as azelaic acid, slicylates, peptide antibiotics,
cyclosporines and any combination thereof at a therapeuti-
cally effective concentration Another group of antibacterial
agents which is non-speciﬁc, comprises strong oxidants and
free radical liberating compounds, such as hydrogen perox-
ide, bleaching agents (cg, sodium, calcium or magnesium
hypochloride and the like) iodine, chlorohexidine and ben-
zoyl peroxide,

[0299] Antibacterial compositions according to the pres-
ent invention may be used to treat infections of the skin. An
example of a very common skin infection is acne, which
involve infestation of the sebaceous gland with p, acnes, as

[0429] Comments: The compositions were identical other
than for the presence or absence of the emollient isopropyl
myristatel When present, isopropyl myristate was at a con-
centration of 5% w/w of the formulation prior to addition of
propellant. When absent. 1PM was replaced by water. Both
foam compositions were found to be non-flammable accord-
ing to the test parameters used. The formulation without
1PM did not ignite. So the underlying carrier formulation
without oil or with only 5% is non-ﬂammable. However, the

Propellant Aerosol

[0186] Aerosol propellants are used to generate and
administer the foamable composition as a foam. The total
composition including propellant, foamable compositions
and optional ingredients is referred to as the foamable
carrier. The propellant makes up about 5-25 wt % of the
foamable carrier. Examples of suitable propellants include
volatile hydrocarbons such as butane, propane, isobutane or
mixtures thereof, and ﬂuorocarbon gases.

[0187] Compositions of commercially available highly
ﬂammable hydrocarbon propellants are listed in the table
below,

Composition and Foam Physical Characteristics

1. Composition Flow Properties:

[0188] It is important to have a composition, including
water, hydrophobic solvents, formulation excipients and
propellant, in a stable emulsion, which ascertain acceptable
shelf-life of the product.

[0189] Yet, another crucial property is that said composi-
tion has to be free ﬂowing, since otherwise, it camiot ﬂow
through the dip-tube of the aerosol container and create
acceptable foam, It has been noted that in the context of the
composition of the present invention, compositions com-
prising semi-solid hydrophobic solvents, e.g:, white petro-
latum, are excessively viscous and demonstrate poor
ﬂowability.

[0190] The combination of a surface active agent, foaming
adjuvant and water gelling agent according to one or more
embodiments of the invention provides a low speciﬁc grav-
ity foam having superior ﬂow properties and sheer break-
ability (among other attributes). According to one or more
embodiments of the present invention, the total amount of
surface active agent, foaming adjuvant and water gelling
agent, in combination does not exceed 8% (w/w) of foam-
able composition. In other embodiments, the combined
amounts of surface active agent, foaming adjuvant and water
gelling agent is less than 5% (W/w) of foamable composi-
tion: The low solids content improves the ﬂow properties of
the foam, reduces unpleasant skin residue and reduces the
cost of manufacture As is demonstrated herein, the foam
quality and foam breakability is excellent, despite the low
levels of these components in the foam.

Jan. 31, 2019

2. Foam Properties:

[0191] The following scale for foam quality is used to
evaluate foams:

[0192] E (excellent): very rich anc creamy in appearance,
does not show any bubble structure or shows a very ﬁne
(small) bubble structure;
[0193] G (good): rich and creamy in appearance, very
small bubble size, “dulls” more ra idly than an excellent
foam;
[0194] FG (fairly good): a moderate amount of creaminess
noticeable, bubble structure is noticeable;

[0195] F (fair): very little creaminess noticeable. larger
bubble structure than a “fairly gooc” foam;

[0196] P (poor): no creaminess noticeable, large bubble
structure; and

[0197] VP (very poor): dry foam,
difﬁcult to spread on the skin,
[0198] Foams, adequate for topica administration accord-
ing to the present invention have to be of quality grade B or
G upon release from the aerosol container. Smaller bubbles
mean more stable foam. which does not collapse spontane-
ously immediately upon discharge rom the container The
liner foam stmcture looks and feels smoother, thus increas-
ing its usability and appeal,

[0199] A crucial aspect of foam properties, according to
the present invention is breakability. Sheer-force breakabil-
ity of the foam, as attained by the composition of the present
invention is clearly advantageous to thennally-induced
breakability, present, for example in US, Pat, No. 6,126,
920, and the respective Olux and Luxiq products, as dem-
onstrated by the fact that according to the use instructions of
Olux and Luxiq. the foam cannot be applied on the hand and
aﬂerwards delivered to the afﬂicted area, since it immedi-
ately collapses upon exposure to skin temperature.

[0200] Yet, another important property is speciﬁc gravity
of the foam, as measured upon release from the aerosol can,
Typically, foams according to the present invention have
speciﬁc gravity of less than 0.1 g/mL and more preferably,
less than 0:05 g/mL.

Fields of Pharmaceutical Applications

[0201] By including an appropriate therapeutic agent in
the foamable carrier, the foam composition of the present
invention is useful in the therapy of a variety of dermato-
logical disorders (also termed “dermatoses”) including, in a
non-limiting exemplary manner:

[0202] Dermatitis

[0203] Contact Dermatitis
[0204] Atopic Dermatitis
[0205] Seborrheic Dermatitis
[0206] Nummular Dermatitis
[0207] Chronic Dermatitis Of The Hands And Feet
[0208] Generalized Exfoliative Dermatitis
[0209] Stasis Dermatitis
[0210] Lichen Simplex Chronicus
[0211] Bacterial Infections
[0212] Cellulitis
[0213] Acute Lymphangitis
[0214] Lymphadenitis
[0215] Erysipelas
[0216] Cutaneous Abscesses
[0217] Necrotizing Subcutaneous Infections
[0218] Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome
US 2019/0029958 A1

well Staphylncocus auras and pseudomorms. Various anti-
bacterial agents have been utilized to treat acne, however,
their eﬂicacy is limited due to their low penetration into the
hydrophobic environment of the skin layers and sebaceous
glands, The composition of the present invention, compris-
ing a hydrophobic component, would facilitate an enhanced
rate of penetration. Furthermore, the intrinsic antibacterial
and antiinﬂammatory effects of the foam adjuvant agents,
i.e., fatty alcohols and acids, provides a combined effect that
should result in a better therapeutic response to treatment.
[0300] The composition of the present invention is par-
ticularly useful and beneﬁcial in the prevention and treat-
ment of secondary infections, accompanying skin-structure
damage, such as in cuts, wounds, burns and ulcers. In all
such cases, the present formulation is easy to use, being in
foam state when applied and becoming liquid instantly upon
rubbing onto the skin.

[0301] While being useful in the prevention and treatment
of infections, the antibacterial foam of the present invention
is also applicable for decontaminating areas, afﬂicted with
bacterial warfare organisms, such as anthrax and smallpox.
[0302] The same advantage is expected when the compo-
sition of the present invention is topically applied to mucosa]
membranes, the oral cavity, the vagina and the rectum.

Anti-Fungal Agents

[0303] Fungal infections are another object of treatment
using the composition of the present invention, Superﬁcial
fungal infection of the skin is one of the commonest skin
diseases seen in general practice. Dermatophytosis is prob-
ably the most common superﬁcial fungal infection of the
skin. It is caused by a group of fungi, which are capable of
metabolizing the keratin of human epidermis, nails or hair
There are 3 genera of dermatophytes causing dermatophy-
tosis, i,e, microspomm, trichophylon and epidermophyton.
[0304] Candidiasis is an infection caused by the yeast like
fungus candida albicans or occasionally other species of
candida. Clinical syndromes of candidiasis include: (a) oral
candidiasis (oral thrush); (b) candidiasis of the skin and
genital mucous membrane; and (c) candida paronychia,
which inﬂicts the nail.

[0305] The pharmaceutical composition may comprise an
antifungal drug, which is active against dermatophytes and
candida, selected from the group of, but not limited to
azoles, diazoles, triazoles, miconazole, ﬂuconazole, keto-
conazole, clotrilnazole, itraconazole griseofulvin,
ciclopirox, amorolﬁne, terbinaﬁne, Aniphotericin B, potas-
sium iodide, ﬂucytosine (SFC) and any combination thereof
at a therapeutically effective concentration.

[0306] It is useful, for example for the treatment of tinea
corporis, tinea pedis, tinea rubrum, tinea unguium, tinea
crul'is, tinea barbae and tinea versicolor, as well as yeast
Infections, such as candidiasis, and candida] vaginitis.

Anti-Viral Agents

[0307] The composition of the present invention is par-
ticularly beneﬁcial in the case of viral infections. Cold sores
are caused by the herpes simplex Type 1 virus and are
sometimes referred to as facial herpes. Mollusca are small
viral growths that appear singly or in groups on the face,
trunk, lower abdomen, pelvis, inner thighs, or penis.
Shingles (herpes zoster), which usually only occurs once in
a lifetime, appears as a rash (clusters of blisters with a red

base). It is caused by the same virus responsible for chick-
enpox. Warts are a common, benign skin tumor caused by
viral infection.

[0308] Viral infections are currently treated with various
antiviral agents, as summarized in the following table:

[0309] Any of the above antiviral drugs, in a therapeuti-
cally effective concentration, can be incorporated in the
foam composition of the present invention. The composition
of the present invention, which comprises a hydrophobic
solvent, would facilitate an enhanced rate of penetration and
better topical distribution of any of the above listed antiviral
drugs. Furthermore, the intrinsic antiviral effects of the foam
adjuvant agents, i.e., fatty alcohols and acids, provides a
combined effect that should result in a better therapeutic
response to treatment.

Antiinﬂamrnatory or Antiallergic Agents

[03 10] Yet, according to another embodiment according to
the present invention the dnlg is an antiinﬂammatory or
antiallergic agent. Antiinﬂammatory or antiallergic agent
can be selected from the group of corticosteroids, non-
steroidal antiinﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs), anti-hista-
mines, immunosuppressants and any combination thereof at
a therapeutically effective concentration.

[0311] The following table provides a summary of cur-
rently available corticosteroid agent and their typical thera-

[0312] The concentrations of corticosteroid drugs, as pre-
sented in the above table are provided herein only as
example, and any therapeutically eﬁective concentration of
such corticosteroids can be incorporated in the composition
of the present invention.

[0313] Since all corticosteroid drugs are typically hydro-
phobic, the can'ier of the present invention, comprising a
hydrophobic solvent, is most suitable as a vehicle to facili-
tate better topical distribution and an enhanced rate of
penetration of any of the above listed drugs, Furthermore,
the intrinsic antiviral, antibacterial and antiinﬂammatory
eﬁects of the foam adjuvant agents; i.e., fatty alcohols and
acids, provides a combined etfect that should result in a
better therapeutic response to treatment,

[0314] Psoriasis is a very common chronic skin disease,
which may be the target of treatment using the composition
of the present invention. It is marked by periodic ﬂare-ups
of sharply deﬁned red patches covered by a silvery, ﬂaky
surface

[0315] Corticosteroid ointments, greasy preparations con-
taining little or no water, are commonly used for treating
psoriasis. Their main disadvantage is in their sticky feeling,
which remains so long aﬁer treatment is over. By contrast,
the foam of the present invention, while comprising con-
siderable concentration of an oil (hydrophobic solvent),
spreads very easily throughout the aﬂlicted area and absorbs
into the skin without leaving any untoward sensation or
look. Examples of other inﬂammatory disorders, which can
be treated by the composition of the present invention,
wherein the drug is a steroid are atopic dermatitis, seborrhea,
seborrheic dermatitis of the face and trunk, seborrheic
blepharitis, contact dermatitis, stasis dermatitis (gravita-
tional eczema; varicose eczema), exfoliative dermatitis
(erythrodenna), lichen simplex chronicus, pityriasis rosea
and pemphigus.

[0316] Topical antihistaminic preparations currently avail-
able include 1% and 2% diphenhydramine (Benadlyl® and
Caladryl®), 5% doxepin (Zonalon®) cream, phrilamine
maleate, chlorpheniramine and tripelennamine, phenothiaz-
ines, promethazine hydrochloride (Phenergan®) and dime-
thindene maleate, These drugs, as well as additional anti-
histamins can also be incorporated in the composition of the
present invention.

[0317] It is pointed out that polyunsaturated fatty acids,
containing omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids (eg, linoleic
and linolenic acid, gamma-linoleic acid (GLA), eicosapen-
taenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) are
beneﬁcial in the trwtment of psoriasis and other skin inﬂam-
mation conditions,

[0318] A second class of anti-inﬂammatory agents, which
is useful in the foam of the present invention, includes the
nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory agents (N SAIDs). The vari-
ety of compounds encompassed by this group is well-known
to those skilled in the art. Speciﬁc non-steroidal anti-inﬂam-
matory agents useful in the composition invention include,
but are not limited to:

fen, and tiaprofenic; and

[0324] 6) Pyramles, such as phenylbutazone, oxyphenb-
utazone, feprazone, azapropazone, and trimethazone.
[0325] Any further steroidal and nonsteroidal compounds,
having the capacity to prevent, alleviate the symptoms of,
treat or cure inﬂammation processes, are generally included,
as possible anti-inﬂammatory agents, according to the pres-
ent invention.

[0326] The pharmaceutical composition of the present
invention may also comprise an antiinﬂammatory or antial-
lerg'ic agent, wherein said agent reduces the occurrence of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines or inhibits the eﬁect of pro-
inﬂammatory cytokines.

[0327] Mixtures of such anti-inﬂammatory agents may
also be employed, as well as the dermatologically acceptable
salts, esters, amides, prodrugs and derivatives of these
agents.

[0328] Topical application of a foam, comprising a safe
and effective dose of an NSAID can be useful in the
prevention and/or alleviation of the symptoms of rheumatoid
arthritis, osteoarthritis and pain. Topical NSAIDs, incorpo-
rated in the foam of the present invention can be also used
in the treatment of dermatological disorders, such as acne,
rosacea. hair growth disorders, actinic keratosis and certain
skin cancer conditions.

[0329] The compositions of the present invention may
contain a safe and effective amount of a topical anesthetic,
Examples of topical anesthetic drugs include benzocaine,
lidocaine, bupivacaine, chlorprocaine, dibucaine, etido-
caine, mepivacaine, tetracaine, dyclonine, hexylcaine, pro-
caine, cocaine, ketamine, pramoxine, phenol, and pharma-
ceutically acceptable salts thereof. Mixtures of such
anesthetic agents may be synergistically beneﬁcial.

Keratolytically Active Agents

[0330] The term “keratoly‘tically active agent” is used
herein to mean a compound which loosens and removes the
stratum comeum of the skin, or alters the structure of the
keratin layers of skin,

[0331] Keratolytically active agents are used in the treat-
ment of many dermatological disorders, which involve dry
skin, hyperkeratiinization (such as prsoriasis), skin itching
(such as xerosis), acne and rosacea.

[0332] Suitable keratolytically active agent include phenol
and substituted phenolic compounds. Such compounds are
known to dissolve and loosen the intracellular matrix of the
US 2019/0029958 A1

[0174] Ethers of polyethylene glycol and alkyl alcohols
are suitable non-ionic surfactants for use in the present
invention. Exemplary hydrophobic ethers include PEG-3
oleyl ether (Volpo 3) and PEG-4 lauryl ether (Brij 30).
[0175] The polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene (POE-
POP) block copolymers are a unique class of polymeric
surfactants The unique structure of the surfactants, with
hydrophilic POE and hydrophobic POP moieties in well-
deﬁned ratios and positions, provides a wide variety of
surfactants suitable for use in the present invention. These
surfactants are available under various trade names, includ-
ing Synperonic PE series (1C1), P1uronic® series (BASF),
Emkalyx, Lutrol (BASF), Supronic, Monolan, Pluracare,
and Plurodac. The generic term for these polymers is
“poloxamer” (CAS 9003-11-6). Exemplary hydrophilic sur-
factants of this class include Poloxamers 108, 188, 217, 238,
288, 338, and 407. Exemplary hydrophobic surfactants in
this class include Poloxamers 124, 182, 183, 212, 331, and
335.

[0176] Sorbitan esters of fatty acids are suitable non-ionic
surfactants for use in the present invention. Among these
esters, preferred hydrophobic surfactants include sorbitan
monolaurate (Arlacel 20), sorbitan monopalmitate (Span-
40), sorbitan monooleate (Span-80), sorbitan monostearate,
and sorbitan tristearate.

[0177] Esters of lower alcohols (C2 to C4) and fatty acids
(C3 to C13) are suitable non-ionic surfactants for use in the
present invention. Among these esters, preferred hydropho-
bic surfactants include ethyl oleate (Crodamol EO), isopro-
pyl myristate (Crodamol 1PM), and isopropyl palmitate
(Crodamol IPP).

[0178] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the surface-active agent comprise mono-, di- and
tri-esters of sucrose with food fatty acids (sucrose esters),
prepared from sucrose and methyl and ethyl esters of food
fatty acids or by extraction from sucroglycerides. Exemplary
sucrose esters include sucrose monopalmitate and sucrose
monolaurate. Suitable sucrose esters include those having a
high monoester content, which have higher HLB values.
[0179] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, a combination of a non-ionic surfactant and an anionic
surfactant (such as sodium lauryl sulphate) is employed. at
a ratio of between 1:] and 20:1, or at a ratio of 4:1 to 10:1.
The resultant foam has a low speciﬁc gravity, e.g., less than
0.1 g/ml, which upon rubbing (shear stress) onto the skin
collapses easily, to allow facile absorption.

[0180] Unlike prior art foamable compositions, the total
surfactant employed to obtain a foam that is stable, of low
speciﬁc gravity and has a ﬁne bubble structure is low. Lower
surfactant levels, particularly of ionic surfactants, are pre-
ferred to reduce skin irritations. Total surfactant is in the
range of 0.1 to 5.0 wt % of the foamable composition, and
is typically less than 2 wt %, or even less than 1 wt %.

Water Gelling Agents

[0181] The water gelling agent according to one or more
embodiments of the present invention stablizes the aqueous
phase by, for example, increasing viscosity and linking
capability. Exemplary water gelling agents that can be used
in accordance with one or more embodiments of the present
invention include for example, but are not limited to, natu-
rally-occurring polymeric materials such as, locust bean
gum, sodium alginate, sodium caseinate, egg albumin, gela-
tin agar, carrageenin gum sodium alginate, xanthan gum,

Jan. 31, 2019

quince seed extract, tragacanth gum, starch, chemically
modiﬁed starches and the like, semi»synthetic polymeric
materials such as cellulose ethers (e.g. hydroxyethyl cellu-
lose, methyl cellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, hydroxy
propylmethyl cellulose), polyvinylpyrrolic one, polyvinylal-
cohol, guar gum, hydroxypropyl guar gum, soluble starch,
cationic celluloses, cationic guars and the ike and synthetic
polymeric materials such as carboxyviny polymers, poly-
vinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol polyacrylic acid poly-
mers, polymethacrylic acid polymers, olyvinyl acetate
polymers, polyvinyl chloride polymers, polyvinylidene
chloride polymers and the like. Mixtures of the above
compounds are contemplated.
[0182] Further exemplary water gelling agents include the
acrylic acid/ethyl acrylate copolymers anc the carboxyviny]
polymers sold, for example, by the BF. Goodrich Company
under the trademark of Carbopol RegisteredTM resins. These
resins consist essentially of a colloidal water-soluble poly-
alkenyl polyether crosslinked polymer of acrylic acid cross-
linked with from 0.75% to 2% of a cross inking agent such
as polyallyl sucrose or polyallyl pentaery‘thritol. Examples
include Carbopol 934, Carbopol 940, Carbopol 950, Car-
bopol 980, Carbopol 951 and Carbopol 981. Carbopol 934
is a water-soluble polymer of acrylic acid crosslinked with
about 1% of a polyallyl ether of sucrose aving an average
of about 5.8 allyl groups for each sucrose molecule.
[0183] The gelling agent is present in an amount in the
range of about 0.1% to about 5.0 wt % of the foamable
composition. In one or more embodiments, it is typically
less than 1 wt % of the foamable composition,

 

“Alcohol Free”

[0184] Unlike the composition disclosed in Us. Pat. No,
6,126,920, which contains a 40-90 wt % aliphatic alcohol,
the composition of the present invention does not contain
such amount alcohols. For the purpose of the present appli-
cation, the term “alcohol free” shall mean that the compo-
sition contains no more than an incidental amount of an
aliphatic alcohol, e.g. less than about 7.5% of any aliphatic
alcohol, having one to six carbon atoms in their carbon
backbone, or no more than 7.5% of any mixture of such
aliphatic alcohols. Alcohols at these low levels are not
considered to have a negative effect on skin or mucous
membranes. In one or more embodiments, the foamable
compositions do not contain any alcohol.

Optional Ingredients

[0185] The pharmaceutical or cosmetic foam carrier of the
present invention may further optionally comprise a variety
of pharmaceutical or cosmetic ingredients, which are added
in order to ﬁne-tune the consistency of the formulation,
protect the formulation components from degradation and
oxidation and bestow their cosmetic acceptability. Such
excipients, may be selected, for example, from the group
consisting of diglycerides, triglycerides, stabilizing agents,
antioxidants, humectants, ﬂavoring, colorant and odorant
agents and other formulation components, used in the art of
pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulary. A pharmaceutical
or cosmetic composition manufactured using the foam car-
rier according to the present invention is Very easy to use.
When applied onto the aﬂlicted body surface of humans or
animals, it is in a foam state, allowing free application
without spillage. Upon further application of a mechanical

[0163] A combination of surface active agents is possible,
Any surface-active agent or combinations thereof may be
used as surface-active agent. According to one or more
embodiments of the present invention, the surface-active
agent (or agents) has an HLB of higher than 9.

[0164] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the surface-active agent is selected from the groups of
non-ionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, amphoteric and
zwitterionic surfactants, and, in particular, the surface-active
agent is a non-ionic surfactant Ionic surfactants (including
cationic, anionic, amphotheric and zwitterionic surfactants)
are known to be skin irritants. Therefore, non-ionic surfac-
tants are preferred in applications including sensitive skin
such as found in most derrnological disorders, We have
surprisingly found that non-ionic surfactants alone provide
foams of excellent quality, i.e. a score of “E" according to
the grading scale discussed below,

[0165] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the surface active agent is solely non-ionic, comprising
one or more non-ionic surfactants,

[0166] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the surface active agent include a ratio of non-ionic
surfactants to ionic surfactants in the range of 100:1 to 6:1;
in some embodiments the non-ionic to ionic surfactant ratio
is greater than 6:1, or greater than 8:1; or greater than 14:1,
or greater than 16:1, or greater than 20:1.

[0167] Exemplary non-ionic surfactants include poly-
ethoxylated fatty acids, fatty acid diesters, polyethylene
glycol glycerol fatty acid esters, alcohol-oil transesteriﬁca-
tion products, polyglycerized fatty acids, sterol and sterol
derivatives, polyethylene glycol sorbitan fatty acid esters,
polyethylene glycol alkyl ethers, sugar esters, polyethylene
glycol alkyl phenols, polyoxyethylene-polyoxypropylene
block copolymers, sorbitan fatty acid esters and lower
alcohol fatty acid esters,

[0168] Although polyethylene glycol (PEG) itself does not
function as a surfactant, a variety of PEG-fatty acid esters
have useful surfactant properties. Exemplary monoesters
include esters of lauric acid, oleic acid, and stearic acid, e.g,,
PEG-8 laurate, PEG-8 oleate, PEG-8 stearate, PEG-9 oleate,
PEG-10 laurate, PEG-10 oleate, PEG-12 laurate, PEG-12

PEG-20 com glycerides (Crovol M40), and PEG-20 almond
glycerides (Crovol A40). The latter two surfactants are
reported to have HLB values of 10, which are generally
considered to be the approximate border line between hydro-
philic and hydrophobic surfactants.

[0170] Alcohol-oil transesteriﬁcation derivatives of oil
soluble vitamins (e,g., vitamins A, D, E, K, etc.), such as
tocopheryl PEG-100 succinate (TPGS, available from East-
man), are also suitable surfactants,

[0171] Polyglycerol esters of fatty acids are also suitable
non-ionic surfactants for the present invention. Among the
polyglyceryl fatty acid esters, exemplary use hydrophobic
surfactants include polyglyceryl oleate (Plurol Oleique),

soybean oil foam compositions. In additional embodiments,
the concentration of the soybean oil is suﬂicient to reduce
the degree of inﬂammability, when compared with the same
composition where the oil component comprises a different
oil, or other oil like substance, such as petrolatum or an ester
of a fatty acid. In a further embodiment the the soybean oil
is combined in substantial or signiﬁcant amounts with a
different oil, or other oil like substance, and acts to reduce
the degree of inﬂammability of the resultant foam, when
compared with the same composition with the diﬂerent oil,
or other oil like substance.

[0139] Notably, foam compositions comprising soybean
oil at 20%, 30.5% and 40% by weight were all ﬂammable
retardent and did not ignite at 30.5% or 20%,

[0140] Surprisingly, it has also been discovered that sili-
cone oils also reduce the ﬂammability of a foam, as dem-
onstrated in a simpliﬁed standard inﬂammability test based
on European Standard prEN 14851, titled “Aerosol contain-
ersiAero sol foam ﬂammability test”, which was performed
on dimethicone foam compositions, In additional embodi-
ments, the concentration of the dimethicone is sufﬁcient to
reduce the degree of inﬂammability, when compared with
the same composition where the oil component comprises a
different oil, or other oil like substance, such as petrolatum
or an ester of a fatty acid, In a further embodiment the the
dimethicone oil is combined in substantial or signiﬁcant
amounts with a different oil, or other oil like substance, and
acts to reduce the degree of inﬂammability of the resultant
foam, when compared with the same composition with the
diﬂerent oil, or other oil like substance.

[0141] Notably, foam compositions comprising dimethi-
cone at 10% and 25% by weight were all ﬂammable retar-
dent and did not ignite at 10%.

[0142] Foam compositions comprising other oil like sub-
stances namely, either octyl dodecanol or isopropyl
myristate as hydrophobic solvent were found to be variable
in behavior. In certain circumstances compositions contain-
ing signiﬁcant amounts of octyl dodecanol or isopropyl
myristate in addition to water were not ﬂammable according
to the simpliﬁed AFNOR like test. whereas in otter certain
circumstances they burnt with a ﬂame too large and or for
too long. Octyl dodecanol or isopropyl myristate appear to
demonstrate similar ﬂammability properties.
[0143] Turning to non-aqueous solvent components it was
observed that petrolatum compositions were ammable,
Possibly, and without being tied to any particu ar theory,
apart from any ﬂammability properties of the petrolatum
itself, it may be that more of the propellant can remain either
dissolved in the solvent or be entrapped in t e bubble
structure and therefore be available for ignition.
[0144] In contrast, ﬂammability tests of compositions with
15% and 35% PPG 15 stearyl ester with different hydrocar-
bon propellant mixtures were found to ignite on most
occasions with a ﬂame higher than that permittec under the
simpliﬁed AFNOR like test.

Hydrophobic Solvent

 

[0145] A hydrophobic solvent according to tie present
invention is a liquid material having solubility in distilled
water at ambient temperature of less than about 1 gm per 100
mL, more preferable less than about 05 gm per 100 mL, and
most preferably less than about 0.1 gm per 100 mL. It is
liquid at ambient temperature.

[0146] The total content of hydrophobic solvent may vary
from 2% to 75% (w/w) of the foamable composition.
However, diﬂerent ranges (herein “composition classes
A-D”) have been designated, in order to facilitate a choice
of an appropriate class, according to the anticipated cosmetic
or pharmaceutical need, As a rule of thumb, higher hydro-
phobic solvent concentrations are more appropriate for the
treatment of dry skin, and/or for the treatment of a disease,
which is more responsive to drugs delivered in an oily
vehicle. Likewise, the higher oil-content composition
classes provide an enhanced occlusive effect, which in turn
induces the skin penetration of an active agent. Another
consideration relates to user acceptance of a product con-
taining a high concentration of the hydrophobic solvent
(from about 25% of the composition), which would leave
some oily feeling post-application. Thus, a particular com-
position of the present invention is selected having a hydro-
phobic solvent concentration in View of the target population
and its speciﬁc needs

[0147] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the hydrophobic solvent is mineral oil. Mineral oil
(Chemical Abstracts Service Registry number 8012-95-1) is
a mixture of aliphatic, naphthalenic, and aromatic liquid
hydrocarbons that are derived from petroleum. It is typically
liquid; its viscosity is in the range of about 35 CST to about
100 CST (at 40° C), and its pour point (the lowest tem-
perature at which an oil can be handled without excessive
amounts of wax crystals forming) is below 0° C. By contrast,
white petrolatum, also termed “Vaseline”, is disadvanta-
geous, due to its waxy nature. It is known to leave waxy and
sticky feeling aﬂer application and occasionally stain cloths.
Thus, white petrolatum and other semi-solid oils are not a
preferred hydrophobic solvent according to the present
invention.

[0148] Yet another preferred hydrophobic solvents are
liquid oils from vegetable, marine or animal sources. By
way of example, the unsaturated oil may be selected from
the group consisting of olive, corn, soybean. canola, cotton-
seed, coconut, sesame, sunﬂower, borage seed, syzigium
ammuticum, hempseed, herring, cod—liver, salmon, ﬂaxseed,
wheat germ and evening primrose oils and mixtures thereof,
at any proportion.

[0149] A particularly preferred class of oils includes poly-
unsaturated oils, e,g., esters, and in particular glyceryl esters,
of omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, Examples of such
polyunsaturated fatty acids are linoleic and linolenic acid,
gamma-linoleic acid (GLA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)
and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Thus, in one or more
embodiments of the present invention the hydrophobic sol-
vent includes at least 6% by weight foamable composition of
an oil selected from omega-3 oil, omega-6 oil, and mixtures
thereof

[0150] Another class of oils suitable for use as a phydro-
phobic solvent is liquid hydrophobic plant-derived oils, or
essential oils, elgi “therapeutic oils” containing active bio-
logically occuning molecules that have a therapeutic eﬂect
when applied topically. Examples of such oils include rose-
hip oil, which contain retinoids and is known to reduce acne
and post-acne scars, and tea tree oil, which possess antibac-
terial, antifungal and antiviral properties. Other examples of
essential oils are oils of basil, camphor, cardamom, carrot,
citronella, clary sage, clove, cypress, frankincense, ginger,
grapefruit, hyssop, jasmine, lavender, lemon, mandarin,
marjoram, myrrh, neroli, nutmeg, petitgrain. sage, tangerine,
US 2019/0029958 A1

vanilla, Verbena, as well as any other therapeutically ben-
eﬁcial oil, know in the art of herbal medication.

[0151] Medium-chain triglycerides (“MCT’s”) have an
average molecular weight of about :500. They are some-
times referred to as MCT oil or thin vegetable oil, They take
the form of a colorless to slightly yellowish oily liquid that
is practically odorless and tasteless and which solidiﬁes at
about 0° C. They are miscible with long-chain hydrocarbons
and triglycerides but are practically insoluble in water. They
consist of a mixture of triglycerides of saturated fatty acids,
mainly of caprylic acid and of capric acid and contain not
less than 95% of saturated fatty acids.

[0152] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the hydrophobic solvent is an “emollient”, An emol-
lient is a hydrophobic agent that softens, smoothens and
improves lipid content of the skin or other mucous mem-
branes. In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the emollient is a liquid. Without derogating the
generality of this deﬁnition, examples of suitable emollients
for use include isostearic acid derivatives, isopropyl palmi-
tate, lanolin oil, diisopropyl dimerate, diisopropyl adipate,
dimethyl isosorbide, maleated soybean oil, octyl palmitate,
isopropyl isostearate, cetyl lactate, cetyl ricinoleate, tocoph-
eryl acetate, acetylated lanolin alcohol, cetyl acetate, phenyl
trimethicone, glyceryl oleate, tocopheryl linoleate, wheat
germ glycerides, arachidyl propionate, myristyl lactate,
decyl oleate, propylene glycol ricinoleate, isopropyl lano-
late, pentaerythrityl tetrastearate, neopentylglycol dicapry-
late/dicaprate, hydrogenated coco-glycerides, isononyl
isononanoate, isotridecyl isononanoate, myristyl myristate,
triisocetyl citrate, octyl dodecanol. octyl hydroxystearate
and mixtures thereof Other examples of other suitable
emollients can also be found in the Cosmetic Bench Refer-

ence, pp, 1, 19-1 ,22 (1996) In one or more embodiments, the
hydrophobic solvent is a mixture of a mineral oil or silicone
oil and an emollient.

[0153] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, silicone oil is a component ofthe hydrophobic solvent,
Silicone oils are used in the foamable compositions due to
their known skin protective and occlusive properties. Suit-
able silicone oils for use in the invention include non-
volatile silicones, such as polyalkyl siloxanes, polyaryl
siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes and polyether siloxane
copolymers, polydimethylsiloxanes (dimethicones) and poly
(dimethylsiloxane)-(diphenyl-siloxane) copolymersi These
are preferably chosen from cyclic or linear polydimethylsi-
1oxanes containing from about 3 to about 9, preferably from
about 4 to about 5, silicon atoms. Volatile silicones such as
cyclomethicones can also be used, Water-soluble silicones,
such as dimethicone copolyol are not included in the deﬁ-
nition of silicone oils (as hydrophobic solvents) according to
the present invention

[0154] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the composition comprises at least 2% (w/w foamable
composition) silicone oil, alone or as part of the hydrophobic
solvent, Yet, in other embodiments, the composition com-
prises at least 5% (w/w) silicone oil alone or as part of the
hydrophobic solventi

[0155] The hydrophobic solvent of the present invention
may comprise a mixture of two or more of the above
hydrophobic solvents in any proportion.

Foam Adjuvant Agents

[0156] Foam adjuvants are included in the foamable com-
positions of the present invention to increase the foaming
capacity of surfactants and/or to stabilize the foam. In one or
more embodiments of the present invention, the foam adju-
vant agents includes fatty alcohols having 15 or more
carbons in their carbon chain, such as cetyl alcohol and
stearyl alcohol (or mixtures thereof). Other examples of fatty
alcohols are arachidyl alcohol (C20), behenyl alcohol (C22),
1-triacontanol (C30), as well as alcohols with longer carbon
chains (up to C50), Fatty alcohols, derived from beeswax,
including a mixture of alcohols, a majority of which has at
least 20 carbon atoms in their carbon chain, are especially
well suited as foam adjuvant agents according to the present
invention. The concentration of the fatty alcohol, required to
support the foam system is inversely related to the length of
its carbon chains.

[0157] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the foam adjuvant agent includes fatty acids having 16
or more carbons in their carbon chain, such as hexadecanoic
acid (C16) stearic acid (C18), arachidic acid (C20), behenic
acid (C22), octacosanoic acid (C28), as well as fatty acids
with longer carbon chains (up to C50), or mixtures thereof.
[0158] Optionally, the carbon atom chain of the fatty
alcohol or the fatty acid may have at least one double bond.
A further class of foam adjuvant agent according to the
present invention comprises a long chain fatty alcohol or
fatty acid, wherein the carbon atom chain is branched. The
carbon chain of the fatty acid or fatty alcohol can be
substituted with a hydroxyl group, such as 12-hydroxy
stearic acid.

[0159] The foam adjuvant agent according to one or more
embodiments of the present invention includes a mixture of
fatty alcohols, fatty acids and hydroxy fatty acids and
derivatives thereof in any proportion, providing that the total
amount is 0.1% to 5% (w/w) of the carrier mass. More
preferably, the total amount is 0.4%72.5% (w/w) of the
carrier mass.

[0160] While fatty alcohols and fatty acids serve to stabi-
lize the resultant foam composition, they often provide
additional therapeutic properties, Long chain saturated and
mono unsaturated fatty alcohols, eig., stearyl alcohol, erycyl
alcohol, arachidyl alcohol and docosanol have been reported
to possess antiviral, anti infective, anti-proliferative and
anti-inﬂammatory properties (US. Pat. No. 4,874,794).
Longer chain fatty alcohols, e.g,, tetracosanol, hexacosanol,
heptacosanol, octacosanol, triacontanol, etc. are also known
for their metabolism modifying properties and tissue ener-
gizing properties Long chain fatty acids have also been
reported to possess anti-infective characteristics. Thus, the
pharmaceutical or cosmetic canier, containing the foam
adjuvant agent of the present invention provides an extra
therapeutic beneﬁt in comparison with currently used
vehicles, which are inert and non-active.

Surface-Active Agents

[0161] Surface-active agents, according to the present
invention include any agent linking oil and water in the
composition.

[0162] The surface-active agent is suitably selected from
anionic, cationic, nonionic, zwitterionic, aniphoteric and
ampholytic surfactants, as well as mixtures of these surfac-
tants. Such surfactants are well known to those skilled in the
US 2019/0029958 A1

compounds (erg, glutathione), dihydroxy flunaric acid and
its salts, lycine pidolate, arginine pilolate, nordihydrogua-
iaretic acid, bioﬂavonoids, curcumin, lysine, methionine,
proline, superoxide dismutase, silymarin, tea extracts, grape
skin/seed extracts, melanin, and rosemary extracts may be
used,

[0356] The foam of the present invention is suitable for
delivering skin protecting and revitalizing anti-oxidants/
radical scavengers, It is further pointed out that polyunsatu-
rated fatty acids, containing omega-3 and omega-6 fatty
acids (e,g., linoleic and linolenic acid, gamma-linoleic acid
(GLA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA) are beneﬁcial in the treatment of psoriasis and
other skin inﬂanunation conditions, Likewise, emollients
and silicone oils exert moisture-retaining and skin protective
effects on the skin. Thus in a preferred embodiment, a skin
protective foam is provided, wherein the hydrophobic sol-
vent comprises in full or in part, a solvent, selected from the
group of emollients, silicone oil and oils, rich in unsaturated
fatty acids, thus, affording a synergistic therapeutic effect of
the anti-oxidants/radical scavenger agent and the vehicle
components

Self-Tanning Active Agents

[0357] The foam of the present invention is particularly
suitable for the uniform delivery of a tanning active agent
onto large areas of the skin, It is preferable that the com-
positions contain from about 0.1% to about 20%, more
preferably from about 2% to about 7%, and still more
preferably from about 3% to about 6%, of the composition,
of dihydroxyacetone, or any other compound, know in the
art as an artiﬁcial tanning active agent.

Skin Lightening and Whitening Agents

[0358] The foam of the present invention is particularly
suitable for the uniform delivery of a skin lightening agent,
When used, the compositions preferably contain from about
011% to about 10%, more preferably from about 0.2% to
about 5%, of the composition, of a skin-lightening agent,
Suitable skin lightening or whitening agents include those
known in the art, including hydroquinone, azelaic acid and
other related dicarboxylic acids, and salts and derivatives
thereof, retinoids, kojic acid, arbutin, nicotinic acid and its
precursors, salts and derivatives, arbutin, ascorbic acid and
salts and derivatives thereof (e,g., magnesium ascorbyl
phosphate or sodium ascorbyl phosphate), and herbal
extracts (eg, licorice extract, mulberry extract, placental
extract),

[0359] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the foam composition comprises a combination of a
skin whitening agent and a sunscreen agent,

[0360] In one or more embodiments of the present inven-
tion, the foam composition comprises a combination of a
skin whitening agent and an inorganic sunscreen agent,
When inorganic sunscreen agents, e.g, TiOz, are rubbed onto
the skin, they leave a white coating, which provides an
immediate (although transient) whitening effect, which is
highly desirable by the consumer, who wishes to see instant
change in his/her appearance. The whitening agent, in com-
bination with the inorganic sunscreen agent in the foam
carrier can be easily and uniformly distributed on the skin
surface, thereby affording an even instant whitening effect,
unlike creams that are diﬂicult to spread evenly on skin
areas.

Sunscreens

[0361] Exposure to ultraviolet light can result in excessive
scaling and texture changes of the stratum corneum, The
foam of the present invention is advantageous for the
delivery of sunscreen agents. Its application is very conve-
nient and it spreads easily over large skin areas, The pres-
ence of a hydrophobic solvent in the foam ensures long
lasting effect, even while bathing,

[0362] As used herein, “sunscreen active” or “sunscreen
agen” includes both sunscreen agents and physical sun-
blocksr Suitable sunscreen actives may be organic or inor-
ganic.

[0363] Inorganic sunscreens useful herein include the fol-
lowing metallic oxides; titanium dioxide having an average
primary particle size of from about 15 nm to about 100 nm,
zinc oxide having an average primary particle size of from
about 15 nm to about 150 nm, zirconium oxide having an
average primary particle size of from about 15 nm to about
150 nm, iron oxide having an average primary particle size

When used herein, the inorganic sunscreens are present in
the amount of from about 011% to about 20%, preferably
from about 0.5% to about 10%, more preferably from about
1% to about 5%, of the composition.

[0364] A wide variety of conventional organic sunscreen
actives are suitable for use herein. Speciﬁc suitable sun-
screen actives include, for example: p-aminobenzoic acid,
its salts and its derivatives (ethyl, isobutyl, glyceryl esters;
p-dimethylaminobenzoic acid); anthranilates (i.e., o-amino-
benzoates; methyl, menthyl, phenyl, benzyl, phenylethyl,

Agents for Hair Growth Disorders

[0366] Agents, which affect the pattern of hair growth, can
be suitably incorporated in the foam of the present invention.
Male pattern baldness (MPB), the commonest cause of
balding, is induced by the activity of the male homione
dihydrotestosterone (DHT), which converted from the hor-
mone testosterone by the enzymes 5 alpha reductase. Cur-
rent treatments of MPB include minoxidil and agents, which
inhibit 5 alpha reductase, such as ﬁnasteride, spironolactone,
azelaic acid and azelaic acid derivatives and salts. Such
agents, as well as other agents known in the art, can be
incorporated in the foam of the present invention.

[0367] It is further pointed out that polyunsaturated fatty
acids, i.e., such which include any of the essential fatty acids
(EFA’s): linoleic and linolenic acid, gamma-linoleic acid
(GLA), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic
acid (DHA), are also known to contribute to hair growth.
Thus in a preferred embodiment, a hair growth foam is
provided, wherein the hydrophobic solvent comprises in full
or in part, an oil, rich in such unsaturated fatty acids.
[0368] Figure-Forming Agents; Agents to Treat Cellulite/
Slimming

[0369] Figure forming agents such as used in the treatment
of cellulite and in slirmrring products, can be suitably
incorporated in the foam of the present invention. A non-
limiting exemplary list of active agents, known in the
treatment of cellulite and in the induction of a slimming
effect include herbal extracts, such as baldderwack extract,
butcher’s, broom, cayenne, dandelion, red clover, ginkgo
biloba, horse chestnut, witch hazel and borage oil, omega 3
and omega 6 oils, calfeic acid and salts and derivatives
thereof, xanthine agents, such as caffeine, theophiline and

pentoxyphilline, and nicotinic acid and salts and derivatives
thereof.

Agents to Treat Sunburn, Heat Bum, Radiation Burn, Rash
and Itch

[0370] Cosmetic and pharmaceutical ingredients which
are known in the art of pharmacology and cosmetology to
treat dermatitis, minor skin irritations, sunburn, heat bum,
radiation burn, and inhibit inﬂammation can be beneﬁcially
incorporated in the foam of the present invention.

[0371] Examples of such active agents include chamomile
extract (matricaria recutitia), cucumber distillate (cucumis
sativus), lavender water (lavendula angustfolia), rose water
(msa damascena), Witch hazel (hamameli: virginiana),
allantoin, bisabolol, rosehip oil, calendula oil, azulaene,
menthol and camphor.

Use of the Foam as a Lubricating and Protective Foam

[0372] There are several potential uses of the foam, par-
ticularly the silicone-oil based foam, as a lubricating foam.
Typical examples are shaving foam, moisture protection
foam and antifriction foam. For such purposes, the foam can
be used in its basic composition (Without additional formu-
lation aids and active ingredients), or with the addition of
such additives.

Foam for Neutralization and/or Decontamination of
Hazardous Chemicals and Treatment of Heat Burns

[0373] It has been reported that povidone iodine antisep-
tic, a popular iodine product, can ameliorate damage to
guinea pig skin exposed to mustard gas and other chemical
irritants and further reduces, and many times prevents,

Jan. 31, 2019

damage to human skin after accidental heat burns caused by
hot water, oil or hot steam.

[0374] Other active compound, having decontamination
abilities, comprise strong oxidants and free radical liberating
compounds, such as hydrogen oxide, bleaching agents (e g .,
sodium, calcium or magnesium hypochloride and the like)
iodine, chlorohexidine and benmyl peroxide

[0375] The alcohol- free foam of the present invention,
comprising one or more of the above decontaminating and
neutralizing agents can be applied onto the contaminated
skin to form a preventive layer, prior to contamination
measure or as a decontamination/neutralization means, right
after contamination has occurred.

Penetration Enhancers

[0376] A penetration enhancer or permeation enhancer is
an agent used to increase the permeability of the skin to a
pharmacologically active agent to increase the rate at which
the drug diffuses through the skin and enters the tissues and
bloodstream. A chemical skin penetration enhancer
increases skin permeability by reversibly altering the phys-
iochemical nature of the stratum corneum to reduce its
diffusional resistance. In a review of the technical and patent
literature up to 1996, numerous chemical compounds were
cited as skin penetration enhancers. Most of the compounds
are generally recognized as safe (GRAS) ingredients that
would often be considered inert by a formulator (Osborne,
D. W., Henke, J . J ., Pharmaceutical Technology, November
1997, pp 58-86).

[0377] Examples of penetration enhancers, according to
the present invention include: polyols, such as propylene
glycol, hexylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol
n-alkanols, terpenes, di-terpenes, tri-terpenes, terpen-ols,
limonene, terpene-ol, l-menthol, dioxolane, ethylene glycol,
other glycols, and glycerol; sulfoxides, such as dimethyl-
sulfoxide (DMSO), dimethylformanide, methyl dodecyl sul-
foxide, dimethylacetamide; monooleate of ethoxylated glyc-
erides (with 8 to 10 ethylene oxide units); Alone
(1- dodecylazacycloheptan- --2 o-ne), 2- (-—n nonyl)— 1, 3- dioxo-
lane, esters, such as isopropyl myristate/palmitate, ethyl
acetate, butyl acetate, methyl proprionate, capric/caprylic
triglycerides, octylmyristate, dodecyl -myristate; myristyl
alcohol, lauryl alcohol, lauric acid, lauryl lactate ketones;
amides, such as acetamide oleates such as triolein; various
surfactants, such as sodium lauryl sulfate; various alkanoic
acids such as caprylic acid; lactam compounds, such as
azone; alkanols, such as oleyl alcohol; dialkylamino
acetates, and admixtures thereof.

[0378] Lower alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol, isopro-
panol, butanol, iso-butanol, t-butanol and pentanol are not
considered appropriate penetration enhancers according to
the present invention, due to their skin drying and irritation
properties.

[0379] Yet, another preferred class of penetration enhanc-
ers is the cyclodextrins and related compounds. Cyclodex-
trins are structurally related cyclic oligomaltoses which form
a new group of pharmaceutical excipients. These are torus-
shaped molecules with a hydrophilic outer surface and a
lipophilic central cavity. Cyclodextrins are capable of form-
ing water-soluble inclusion complexes with a wide variety
of lipophilic water-insoluble drugs by taking up a whole
drug molecule, or some part of it, into the cavity. The
cyclodextrin molecules are relatively large (molecular
weight ranging from almost 1000 to over 1500), with a
hydrated outer surface, and under normal conditions, cyclo-
dextrin molecules will only permeate the skin barrier with
considerable difﬁculty. It is generally believed that the
cyclodextrin molecules act as true carriers by keeping lipo-
philic drug molecules in solution and deliver them to the
skin surface where they partition from the cyclodextrin
cavity into the skin.

Further Technical Parameters

[0380] The composition of the present invention may be
contained in and dispensed from a container capable of
withstanding the pressure of the propellant gas and having
an appropriate valve/nozzle for dispensing the composition
as foam under pressure. A customary liqueﬁed or com-
pressed gas propellant can be added. in the amount of about
5-25% of the total composition. Liqueﬁed propellants are
gases that exist as liquids under pressure, including high
purity hydrocarbons such as propane, isobutane and n-bu-
tane, dimethyl ether and chloroﬂuorocarbons (CFCs). Com-
pressed gasses are exempliﬁed by air, nitrogen and carbon
dioxide

[0381] A speciﬁc embodiment according to the present
invention comprises placing the composition of the present
invention on a patch, occlusive tape or the skin-contact
compartment of a transdermal delivery apparatus and apply-
ing such object onto the skin, in order to attain effective
superﬁcial treatment or enhanced penetration of the drug
into the skin or through the skin.

[0382] Utilizing such strategy, one can apply drugs, which
are currently administered systemically or that require trans-
dermal delivery, in the preferred therapeutic system of the
present invention Examples for such drugs are nicotine,
testosterone and other male homiones and male hormone
precursors, estrogen and other female hormones and hor-
mone precursors, growth hormone, insulin, caﬁeine, steroi-
dal and non-steroidal antiinﬂammatory agents and thyroid
hormone substitutes.

Example léilnﬂammability Test

[0417] According to European Standard prEN 1485]
(sometimes referred to as the “AFNOR test”iAFNOR is
Association Francaise de Normalisation) a product is con-
sidered inﬂammable if a stable ﬂame appears following
ignition, which is at least 4 cm high and which is maintained
for at least 2 seconds, For the purpose of testing non-
ﬂammability a simpliﬁed test based on the European Stan-
dard test (titled “Aerosol containersiAerosol foam ﬂam-
mability test”) was used. Formulations that ignited for less

“Flame is for longer and or higher than the test lhnh, N = no: Y = yes.

[0451] These formulations are ﬂammable in the presence
of hexylene glycol and of lecithin. When both were substi-
tuted by water the composition was still found to be ﬂam-
mable according to the test parameters usedgsuggesting
(without being bound by this theory) that whilst MCT oil in
water compositions are inherently non-ﬂammable when
there is a phase inversion such that there is a water in oil
emulsion the MCT foam is more combustible and may not
pass the test parameters.

than 2 seconds and which showed a ﬂame of up to 4 cm
above the height of the foam or less were passed as were
formulations that simply did not ignite. However, formula-
tions where the ﬂame was clearly greater than 4 ems were
failed even if the ﬂame bumt for less than 2 seconds.
Formulations that burnt for longer than 2 seconds likewise
failed.

[0418] Approximately 5 g of foam, mousse gel or paste is
sprayed from the aerosol container on to a watchglass. An
ignition source (a lighter) was placed at the base of the
watchglass and any ignition and sustained combustion of the
foam, mousse, gel or paste was observed. The test was
carried out in a draught-free environment capable of venti-
lation, with the temperature controlled at 20:5° C. and
relative humidity in the range of 30% to 80%.

[0419] Interestingly, it appears that the formulations,
which burnt for longer than this period also burnt with a
larger ﬂame than 4 cms. Another initial trend observed was
that apparently formulations that were not stabilized at 20 C
may be more likely to ignite,

Jan. 3], 2019

[0420] In setting up a system to measure ﬂammability
along the lines of the AFNOR test, a number of initial and
minor but possibly potentially signiﬁcant trends were
observed. The ﬁrst was that variability in results was noted
when tests were undertaken without allowing the formula-
tion to reach a settled equilibrium. In passing, it should be
mentioned that from observations of foarnable formulations
in pressurized glass bottles such formulations take time to
reach equilibrium and for example may thicken up consid-
erably in texture overnight, Thus, results were more repro-
ducible after formulations were allowed to reach equilibrium
overnight in an incubator Reproducibility was likewise
improved by using larger canisters. Also, the incidence of
ignition and ﬂammability appeared to increase when the
temperature was highen

glycolic acid and their derivatives and salts; or beta-hydroxy
acids such as salicylic acid and salicylic acid salts and
derivatives), urea, hyaluronic acid, phytic acid, lipoic acid;
lysophosphatidic acid, skin peel agents (e.g., phenol, resor-
cinol and the like), vitamin B3 compounds (e.g., niacina-
mide, nicotinic acid and nicotinic acid salts and esters,
including non-vasodilating esters of nicotinic acid (such as
tocopheryl nicotinate), nicotinyl amino acids, nicotinyl alco-
hol esters of carboxylic acids, nicotinic acid N-oxide and
niacinamide N-oxide), vitamin B5 and retinoids (eg, reti-
nol, retinal, retinoic acid, retinyl acetate, retinyl palmitate,
retinyl ascorbate). In the case of dry, scaly skin (xerosis) and
ichthyosis such agents can alleviate the symptoms by tem-
porary relief of itching associated with these conditions.

Anti-Oxidants/Radical Scavengers

[0354] A safe and effective amount of an anti-oxidant/
radical scavenger may be added to the compositions of the
subject invention, preferably from about 0.1% to about 10%
(w/w), more preferably from about 1% to about 5% (w/w),
of the composition.

[0355] Anti-oxidants/radical scavengers such as ascorbic
acid (vitamin C) and its salts, ascorbyl esters of fatty acids,
ascorbic acid derivatives (e.g., magnesium ascorbyl phos-
phate, sodium ascorbyl phosphate, ascorbyl sorbate),
tocopherol (vitamin E), tocopherol sorbate, tocopherol
acetate, other esters of tocopherol, butylated hydroxy ben-
zoic acids and their salts, 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethyl-
chroman-2-carboxylic acid (commercially available under
the tradename Trolox.sup.®), gallic acid and its alkyl esters,

hyperkeratinized tissue. As such, they are used in the treat-
ment of dermatological disorders. Dihydroxy benzene and
derivatives thereof have been recognized as potent kera-
tolytic agents. Resorcinol (m-dihydroxybenzene) and
derivatives thereof are used in anti-acne preparations, Hyd-
roquinone (p-dihydroxybenzene), besides its anti-pigmenta-
tion properties, is also keratolytic. These compounds also
exhibit antiseptic properties Cresols also possess bacteri-
cidal and keratolytic properties.

[0333] Vitamin A and its derivatives, such as retinoic acid,
isoretinoic acid, retinol and retinal are another preferred
class of keratolytically active agents.

[0334] Another group of keratoly‘tically active agents
include alpha-hydroxy acids, such as lactic acid and glycolic
acid and their respective salts and derivatives; and beta-
hydroxy acids, such as Salicylic acid (o-hydroxybenzoic
acid) and its salts and pharmaceutically acceptable deriva-
tives, which typically possess anti-inﬂammatory, as well as
keratolytic, activityr

[0335] Yet, another class of preferred keratolytically
active agents includes urea and its derivatives

Retinoids

[0336] Another preferred group of active agents comprise
retinol, retinal, all trans retinoic acid and derivatives, iso-
mers and analogs thereof, collectively termed “retinoids.”
Etretinate, actiretin, isotretinoin, adapalene and tazarotene
are further examples of said retinoid isomers and analogs.
Compositions according to the present invention, which
contain retinoids as t e active drug, can be used for the
treatment of acne, seborrhea, various dermatoses, inﬂam-
mation of the skin, mucosa] membranes, vagina and the
rectum, psoriasis, actinic keratosis and skin cancers, by
application onto the a ected area.

Insecticide and Insect Repellents Agents

[0337] Insects, such as mosquitoes, biting ﬂies, mites,
gnats, ﬂeas, chiggers, unkies, sand ﬂies, lice and ticks can
be annoying and sometimes pose a serious risk to human and
animal health In certain areas of the United States, mos-
quitoes can transmit diseases like equine and St. Louis
encephalitis. Biting ﬂies can inﬂict a painful bite that can
persist for days, swel, and become infected. Ticks can
transmit serious diseases like Lyme disease and Rocky
Mountain Spotted Fever.

[0338] There are several types of insect repellents to use
when protecting peop e and animals from ﬂying or biting
insects, spiders, ticks and mites. By way of example, these
may include DEET (N, N-diethyl-m-toluamide), dimethyl
phthalate, piperonyl butoxide and permethrin. Insect repel-
ling terpenoids, have been reported by Hwang, et al., J.
Chem. Ecol., 11, 1297 (1985); and Ruledge, J. Am. Mos-
quito Control Assoc. 4, 414 (1988).

[0339] A particularly preferred group of insect repellents
includes the terpenoid compounds, described in US Pat.
No 5,411,992, including:

[0340] (1) Terpenoid-alcohol or terpene-ols are terpenoids
which have at least one hydroxyl group. Examples of
terpene-ols include: ClesO compounds, perillyl alcohol,
carveol, niyrtenol, and cis-verbenol; CmHmO compounds,
myrtanol, iso-pinocampheol, dihydrocarveol, isopulegol,

 

Jan. 31, 2019

terpineol, terpinen-4-ol, nerol, geraniol, and linalool, and
CmHmO compounds, menthol, beta-citronellol, and
dihydro—myrcenol;

[0341] (2) Terpenoid-esters are terpenoids, which have at
least one ester group which is the product of the bonding of
the hydroxyl group of a terpene-ol with an aliphatic carbox-
ylic acid that can contain functional groups such as the
hydroxyl or amine on the aliphatic chain. Examples of
suitable aliphatic carboxylic acids include acetic acid, pro-
pionic acid, lactic acid, and various amino acids. Examples
of terpenoid-esters include: carvyl acetate, carvyl propi-
onate, and menthyl lactate; and

[0342] (3) Essential oils which contain terpenoids and
perfumes which contain terpenoids Non-limiting examples
of essential oils which have high content of terpene-ols and
esters include bergamot (62% terpenoids); sage (>50%
terpenoids); styrax (>50% terpenoids); peppermint (>50%
terpenoids); and pine Siberian (75% terpenoids %)r Ter-
penes, aldehydes and ketones vary in their usefulness but as
a general group have potential as insect-repellent.

[0343] The foam of the present invention is particularly
suitable for the eﬂective uniform spreading of an insect
repellent agent onto large areas of the skin of humans and
animals. The hydrophobic solvent present in the foam com-
position helps retain the insect repellent on the skin surface
for an extended period of time

[0344] Yet. in a further embodiment, the foam is suitable
for delivery of insect-killing agents (insecticides) to an
aﬁlicted external surface area of humans and animals. Thus,
the pharmaceutical or cosmetic composition may comprise
an insecticide, known in the art of parasitology. By way of
example, such insecticide can be selected selected from the
group of permethrin, hexachlorobenzene, carbamate, natu-
rally occurring pyrethroids, permethrin, allethrin, malathion,
piperonyl butoxide and any combination thereof at a thera-
peutically eﬂective concentration. Its application is very
convenient and it spreads easily, even over hairy areas. The
hydrophobic solvent present in the foam composition helps
retain the insecticide on the treated area for an extended
period of time Furthermore, the presence of a hydrophobic
solvent in the foam eases mechanical removal of lice and
nits with a comb.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
INVENTION

Foam Flammability

[0130] Foamable compositions comprise of one or more
ﬂammable components. Upon being released from a pres-
surized canister usually by depression of an actuator valve
the ﬂowable composition expands rapidly to form a foam.
Most or essentially all of the propellant immediately
becomes a gas and dissipates into the atmosphere A good to
excellent foam, can be rich to very rich and creamy in
appearance with a very ﬁne to small bubble size. Propellant
gas can to some extent be entrapped in such bubbles.
Relatively small amounts of propellant may initially remain
dissolved in the foam, The amount may vary according to
the foam composition. For example, if the foam comprises
a hydrophobic solvent and the propellant is hydrophobic a
higher amount of propellant may remain in the foam imme-
diately after release when compared to a hydrophillic foam.
So it can be appreciated that the amount of propellant
available to ignite in or about the surface of the foam shortly
aﬂer expansion is variable and can depend extensively on
the components of the foam.

[0131] Ideally, non-ﬂannnable propellants should be used
so that the propellant does not contribute to the ﬂammability
of the foam. However, non-ﬂammable CFC’s are no longer
being used due to the overriding concern of damage to the
ozone layer and global warming consequent on uncontrolled
use of such environmentally unfriendly substances. Other
non-ﬂammable gases like carbon dioxide do not deliver
sufficient pressure and are more suitable for preparation of
mouse cream. Other non-ﬂammable gases like Dymel are
currently not approved for use in the United States. Thus,
many foamahle compositions utilize hydrocarbon propel-
lants especially one or more of propane, isobutene, and or
butane on their own or more preferably in various mixtures
thereof. Such propellants are clearly ﬂammable and to the
extent that a signiﬁcant amount remains in or about the
foam, it can readily ignite when exposed to a naked ﬂame.
Some of the other ingredients readily used in foam compo-
sitions are themselves ﬂannnable, alcohol being a classic
example.

[0132] The ﬂammability of the compositions originally
disclosed in parent application US. patent application Sen
No. 10/532,618 was evaluated. Many were surprisingly
found to he non-ﬂammable or ﬂame retardant, despite the

Jan. 31, 2019

fact that the foamable compositions contained significant
amounts of liquid propellant and ‘combustible’ hydrophobic
solvents.

[0133] Surprisingly, it has been discovered that mineral
oils reduce ﬂammability of a foam, as demonstrated in a
simpliﬁed standard inﬂammability test based on the Euro-
pean Standard prEN 14851, titled “Aerosol containersi
Aerosol foam ﬂammability test”, which was performed on
mineral oil foam compositions. According to this simpliﬁed
standard, a product is considered ﬂammable if a stable ﬂanie
appears following ignition, which is at least 4 cm high and
which is maintained for at least 2 seconds. In additional
embodiments, the concentration of the mineral oil is suﬁi-
cient to reduce the degree of inﬂammability, when compared
with the same composition where the oil component com-
prises a different oil, or other oil like substance, such as
petrolatum or an ester of a fatty acid. In a further embodi-
ment the the mineral oil is combined in substantial or
signiﬁcant amounts with a dilferent oil, or other oil like
substance, and acts to reduce the degree of inﬂammability of
the resultant foam, when compared with the same compo-
sition with the diﬁerent oil, or other oil like substance.
[0134] Mineral oil and MCT oil were discovered to be
consistently ﬂame retardent in the test ranges measured with
different hydrocarbon propellant mixtures. The initial results
showed that neither appeared to be signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced
by the propellant mixture used nor the amount of oil or oil
like substance in the emollient foam.

[0135] Mineral oil appeared to be preferred and foam
compositions comprising mineral oil at 15%, 25%, 35%,
50%, and 60% by weight were all ﬂammable retardant,
Moreover, none of the 15% and none of the 35% by weight
mineral oil foam compositions with three dilferent propel-
lant mixtures ignited.

[0136] Surprisingly, it has been discovered that MCT's
also reduce the ﬂammability of a foam, as demonstrated in
a simpliﬁed standard inﬂammability test based on European
Standard prEN 14851, titled “Aerosol containersiAerosol
foam ﬂammability test”, which was performed on MCT
foam compositions, In additional embodiments, the concen-
tration of the MCT is sufﬁcient to reduce the degree of
inﬂammability, when compared with the same composition
where the oil component comprises a different oil, or other
oil like substance, such as petrolatum or an ester of a fatty
acid. In a further embodiment the the MCT is combined in
substantial or signiﬁcant amounts with a different oil, or
other oil like substance, and acts to reduce the degree of
inﬂammability of the resultant foam, when compared with
the same composition with the diiferent oil, or other oil like
substance.

[0137] Similarly foam compositions comprising MCT oil
at 15%, 35% and 50% by weight were all ﬂammable
retardent. Higher MCT oil concentrations (e.g., 60 wt %) did
not pass the ﬂammability test used. Without being bound to
any particular theory this may have been a consequence of
and due to the formation of a water in oil emulsion,
Moreover, none of the 15% and only one of the 35 wt %
MCT foam compositions with three diﬁerent propellant
mixtures ignited.

[0138] Surprisingly, it has been discovered that vegetable
oils also reduce the ﬂammability of a foam, as demonstrated
in a simpliﬁed standard inﬂammability test based on Euro-
pean Standard prEN 1485], titled “Aerosol containersi
Aerosol foam ﬂammability test”, which was performed on

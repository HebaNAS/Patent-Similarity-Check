[0070] As observed in FIG 4A, increased binding (ad-
sorption) of insulin onto FDKP particles was evident at high
salt concentrations of 100-500 mM at pH from about 2.5 to
about 3.5. At a pH from about 4.0 to about 5.0, for all salt
concentrations tested, a reduction in the adsorption of insu-
lin to the FDKP particle was observed.

[0071] At a pH from about 2.0 to about 3.5 enhanced
binding (adsorption) of GLP-1 to FDKP particles was evi-
dent at all the salt concentrations tested (F IG. 4B). At pH 4.0
and above, a reduction in binding was also noted

[0072] Similar studies using PTH as the active agent
showed enhanced binding of PTH to the FDKP particles at
high salt concentrations of 250 to 1000 mM at pH from
about 2.0 to about 3.5 (FIG. 4C). At pH from about 3.5 to
about 5.0 binding of PTH to the microparticle decreased in
the presence of salt.

[0073] At low pH, where adsorption is not favorable, the
addition of salt was able to modify the chemical potential of
the active agent so as to increase its aﬂinity for the micropar-
ticle surface Such enhancement of binding likely resulted
from a hydrophobic mechanism. Furthermore, the data indi-
cated that as the pH was raised, adsorption decreased with
increased salt concentration. As the microparticle surface
became more charged with increasing pH, the hypothesized
hydrophobic mechanism can be expected to be less effective
at promoting the adsorption of the active agent This reduc-
tion may also have resulted from salt competing for the
binding sites on the surface of the microparticle It is noted
that Debye shielding may also contribute to the reduced
adsorption observed

[0074] The data also showed that salt is capable of altering
the structure of active agents. For example, circular dichro-
ism measurements with PTH showed that as the salt con-
centration increased the secondary structure of the peptide
adopted a more helical conformation (FIG. 4D). This sug-
gests that change in the structure of PTH may promote its
binding to the microparticle surface at low pH

[0075] In an aqueous solution, the presence of salt was
also shown to partition the dye Texas Red onto the surface
of the microparticle.

Effects on Cyclosporin A Adsorption to FDKP
Particles

[007 6] The effects on the adsorption of small hydrophobic
molecules onto FDKP particles was investigated both in
vitro and in vivo using cyclosporin A as the active agent.
Adsorption was promoted by altering the solubility of the
active agent.

[0077] Cyclosporin A, a lipophilic cyclic polypeptide, was
studied in order to show how a hydrophobic molecule can be
made to adsorb to microparticles. In addition, the size of
cyclosporin A (1202.61 MW) was utilized to demonstrate
the loading capacities of microparticles for smaller com-
pounds.

[0078] To accomplish loading, a solvent/anti-solvent
method was employed. The basic principle of this method-
ology is to dissolve the compound in a solvent (methanol)
and then use anti-solvent (water) to drive the compound out
of solution and onto the surface of the microparticles.
Utilizing this solvent/anti-solvent approach, cyclosporin A
was successfully loaded onto the surface of microparticles.

Jan. 31, 2019

[0079] In a preliminary experiment to determine a solu-
bility proﬁle, cyclosporin A was dissolved to 10 mg/mL in
methanol and its solubility at 1 mg/mL with varying con-
centrations of anti-solvent (lo-90% H20 in 10% increments)
was analyzed by HPLC. The cyclosporinA peak areas were
compared against the sample containing methanol alone, to
determine the percent loss to precipitation It was observed
that solubility was largely retained below 60% HZOI At 70%
I120, a signiﬁth majority of the agent was insoluble and at
80-90% H20 less than 5% solubility remained.

[0080] To assess particle loading, FDKP microparticles
were suspended in methanol solutions of cyclosporin A.
Water was then added in a stepwise fashion to ﬁnal concen-
trations of 60, 80, and 90%. Half of the sample was pelleted
and the other half lyophilized. Each half was then redis-
solved such that the ﬁnal percentages were 20% FDKP
microparticles/cyclosporin A, 20% 0.5 M ammonium bicar-
bonate (AmBicarb), and 60% methanol (the concentrations
necessary for the dissolution of both microparticle and
cyclosporin A). The cyclosporin A content of each was
analyzed by HPLC and compared to determine the propor-
tion that had become adsorbed to the particle. The results are
presented in FIG. SA. At 60% H20 it was observed that
about 20% of the cyclosporinA had bound to the particle. At
80% and 90% H20 the loads were about 90% and 95%,
respectively, indicating the strong binding of cyclosporin A
to FDKP microparticles.

[0081] The loading capacity of the microparticles for
cyclosporinA was analyzed at the 90% anti-solvent level by
varying the input of cyclosporin A so that the ﬁnal content
of the recovered solids would be from 2% to 20%, assuming
all of the cyclosporin A became adsorbedi It was observed
that as the input increased over this range the percent of
available cyclosporin A bound to the microparticle increased
from 50% to 95% of the input (FIG. SB). It is to be noted
that, taking into account that the solubility of cyclosporin A
is 0.05 mg/mL at 90% H20, these results indicated that
substantially all of the insoluble cyclosporin A became
adsorbed to the particles rather than precipitating out.

Example 7

Pulmonary Insuﬂlation of Cyclosporin A/DKP
Particles

[0082] To examine the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporin
A/FDKP microparticles, plasma concentrations of
cyclosporinAwere evaluated in female Sprague Dawley rats
administered various formulations of cyclosporin A/FDKP
microparticles via pulmonary insuﬂlation or intravenous
injection. These studies were conducted using cyclosporin
A/FDKP microparticles made at 90% anti-solvent and a
theoretical maximum mass ratio of 0.05, 0.10 or 0.20 as
described in the example above. These are referred to as the
5%, 10% and 20% loads.

[0083] A single dose of 2.5 mg cyclosporin A/FDKP
microparticles was delivered to eight groups of rats via
pulmonary insuﬂlation or intravenous injection. Blood
samples were taken on the day of dosing for each group at
pre-dose (time 0), and at 5, 20, 40, 60, 240, 480 minutes and
at 24 hrs post dose. At each time point, approximately 100
o L whole blood was collected from the lateral tail vein into
a cryovial, inverted and stored on ice. Blood samples were

agent to FDKP microparticle surfaces, most notably at low
pH. Since these modiﬁers have a greater etfect at low pH,
where the microparticle surface is less ionic, it is likely that
adsorption results from a hydrophobic mechanism, The
decrease in adsorption observed at higher pH may result
from the more highly charged surface of the particle in
combination with effects chaotropic and kosmotropic agents
have on increasing the hydrophobicity of the active agents.
Additionally, as ionic species, these agents may compete
with the active agent for binding to the microparticle, or
disrupt the electrostatic interactions between the active agent
and the microparticle. Finally it is also noted that Debye
shielding can contribute to the decrease in adsorption to the
more highly charged surface

Example 3

Effect of Osmolytes on Adsorption of Active Agent
to FDKP Particles

[0061] To assess the importance of active agent stability
on adsorption, the effect of osmolytes on the binding of
active agent to FDKP particles was examined by HPLC
analysis. FIGS. 2A-2C show the loading curves for insulin
(FIG. 2A), GLP-l (FIG, 2B) and ghrelin (FIG. 2C) onto
FDKP particles as a function of pH in the presence of
common stabilizers (osmolytes). Loading of the active agent
onto FDKP microparticles was performed at 5 mg/mL of
microparticles and an insulin concentration of 0.75 mg/mL
(15% w/w), or a GLP-l concentration of 0.25 mg/mL (5%
w/w) or a ghrelin concentration of 0.10 mgmL (2% w/w).
The concentration of the osmolyte (stabilizer) in the samples
was held constant at 100 mM and the pH varied from about
2.0 to about 5.0. The osmolytes were selected from hex-
ylene-glycol (Hex-G137), trehalose, glycine, PEG, TMAO,
mannitol and proline; the control indicates no osmolyte.
[0062] Of the active agents studied, insulin showed sig-
niﬁcantly improved afﬁnity for the FDKP particle surface in
the presence of osmolytes (PEG, glycine, trehalose, manni-
tol and Hex-Gly) over a pH range of 3.0 to 50 (FIG. 2A).
Of the osmolytes studied, PEG and proline improved the
afﬁnity for adsorption of the GLP-l onto FDKP particle
surface over a pH range from 2.0 to 4.0. The osmolyte
TMAO was more effective than PEG or proline at binding
GLP-l onto the FDKP microparticle surface at low pH (2.0)
but was modestly detrimental at pH 3.0 and above (FIG.
2B). Ghrelin however, showed greater aﬁinity for the
microparticle surface in the presence of 100 mM mannitol,
PEG, glycine, Hex-Gly, and trehalose when compared to the
control over the pH range of about 4.0 to 5.0 (F IG. 2C).
[0063] These loading curves suggested that osmolytes are
capable of enhancing the adsorption of the active agent to
FDKP microparticle surface. It is likely that this effect
resulted from the modiﬁers ability to stabilize the active
agent, which enabled adsorption to be more energetically
favorable.

Example 4

Eﬂect of Alcohols on Aﬂinity of Active Agent to
FDKP Particles

[0064] In assessing the effect of modiﬁers on the active
agent that allows for adsorption to the microparticle surface
by a hydrophobic mechanism, the etfect of alcohols were
examined. Alcohols known to induce helical conformation

Jan. 31, 2019

in unstructured peptides and proteins by increasing hydro-
gen-bonding strength were evaluated to determine the role
that helical conﬁrmation plays in adsorption of active agent
to FDKP particles surface. Active agents such as GLP-1 and
ghrelin were analyzed Loading of the active agent on FDKP
particles was performec at 5 mg/mL ofmicroparticles and a
GLP-l concentration of 0.25 mg/mL (5% w/w) or a ghrelin
concentration of 0.10 mg/mL (2% w/w). The effect of each
alcohol was observed over a pH range of 2.0 to 5.0. The
alcohols used were tri uoroethanol (TFE) and hexaﬂuor-
oisopropanol (HFIP). Each alcohol was evaluated at varying
concentrations which include 5%, 10%, 15%, or 20% v/v,

[0065] FIGS. 3A-3D show the loading curves for active
agent onto FDKP micro articles as a function opr for each
alcohol and each active agent. At pH 2.0-4.0, ghrelin showed
greatly improved aﬂinity for the microparticle surface in the
presence of HFIP and TFE at all concentrations tested (5%,
10%, 15% and 20%), as demonstrated by the mass ratio of
ghrelin to FDKP partic es (FIGS, 3A-3B).

[0066] At pH 2.0-5.0, GLP-l showed improved afﬁnity for
the microparticle surface in the presence of HFIP and TFE
at the concentrations shown (5% and 10%) (FIGS. 3C-3D).

The effect of TFE was less pronounced, and at the lower pHs
tested was detrimenta , It was noted that a substantial
amount of GLP-1 peptide (0.13-0.19 mg/mL, which corre-
sponds to mass ratios 0 0.026 to 0.038) was detected in the
reconstituted microparticle-free control samples in the pres-
ence of 10% HFIP and TFE at pH 40, indicating that some
of the GLP-l had precipitated. However, at lower pH
(2.0-3.0), the amount of GLP-1 peptide detected in the
reconstituted microparticle-free control in the presence of
10% HFIP or TFE was signiﬁcantly decreased. At pH 3.0,
GLP-l peptide at 0 to 0.02 mg/mL, (which corresponding to
a mass ratio of 0 to 0.004) was detected, whereas no GLP-l
was detected for the control samples at pH 2.0. The mass
ratios in FIGS. 3C-D reﬂect both adsorbed and precipitated
active agent although precipitation is an increasingly minor
component as the pH decreased toward 3.0.

[0067] The data indicated that alcohols are able to improve
the adsorption of the active agent onto FDKP microparticles.
This increase in adsorption likely resulted from enhanced
hydrophobic interactions between the active agent and sur-
face of the microparticle in the presence of alcohols.

 

Example 5

Effect of Salt on Adsorption of Active Agent to
FDKP Particles

[0068] To further address the hydrophobic mechanism of
binding, the eﬂ‘ects of salt on adsorption of active agent to
FDKP microparticles were observed by HPLC analysis.
[0069] Loading of the active agent onto FDKP micropar-
ticles was performed at 5 mg/mL of microparticles and an
insulin concentration of0.75 mg/mL (15% w/w), or a GLP-l
concentration of 0.25 mg/mL (5% w/w) or a PTH concen-
tration of 0.25 mg/mL (5% w/w) in the presence of 0, 25, 50,
100, 250, and 500 mM NaCl (FIGS. 4A-4C), Loading of
PTH onto FDKP particles was also assessed at 1000 mM
NaCl. The amount of active agent detected in reconstituted
microparticle—free control samples as a ﬁinction of pH and
NaCl concentration was assessed. The pH was controlled
with a 20 mM potassium phosphate/20 mM potassium
acetate mixture.
US 2019/0029961 A1

centrifuged at 4000 rpm and approximately 40 e) L plasma
was pipetted into 96-well plates which were stored at —80°
C. until analyzed.

[0084] As shown in FIG. 6, administration of 2.5 mg
FDKP microparticles/cyclosporin A via pulmonary insuflla-
tion resulted in maximal serum cyclosporin levels 24 hours
post dose in female Sprague Dawley rats, The 10% load
achieved a Cmax of 32.4 ngmL at that time point. Animals
administered 25 mg of FDKP microparticles/cyclosporin A
in 01 mL via intravenous injection showed minimal levels
of cyclosporin out to 24 hours post dose. It was observed that
FDKP microparticle levels peaked at 20 minutes post dose
and returned to baseline levels in 4 hours for both the
intravenous and pulmonary insuﬁlation groups,

[0085] Overall, the data shows the bioavailability of
cyclosporin A/FDKP microparticle. It is noted that the single
peak at 240 minutes is an anomaly For all animals treated,
the pathology as determined by gross and microscopic
observation was normal.

In one embodiment, the micropanicle comprises a dike-
topiperazine such as, but not limited to, fumaryl diketopip-
erazine,

[0015] In yet another embodiment of the present inven-
tion, the method further comprises a step for removing or
exchanging the solvent, Solvent, as used herein, refers to the
ﬂuid medium in which the active agent and microparticle are
“bathed.” It should not be interpreted to require that all
components are in solution. Indeed in many instances it may
be used to refer to the liquid medium in which the micropar-
ticles are suspended,

[0016] In another embodiment of the present invention,
there is provided a process for preparing a drug delivery
composition comprising an active agent and a crystalline

agent solution comprising an active agent molecule; modi-
fying the chemical potential of the active agent; providing a
microparticle in a suspension or powder; and combining the
active agent solution with the microparticle suspension or

dried.

[0017] In another embodiment of the present invention,
the process of modifying the chemical potential of the active
agent allows for interaction between the active agent and a

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0002] This invention relates to drug formulations and is
particularly related to methods, More speciﬁcally, binding or
adsorbing active agents onto the surface of crystalline
microparticles is disclosed.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] Delivery of therapeutic agents has been a major
problem. Oral administration is one of the most common and
preferred routes of delivery due to ease of administration,
patient compliance, and decreased cost, However, the dis-
advantages of this route include low or variable potency and
ineﬁicient adsorption of the therapeutic. This is particularly
evident when the compound to be delivered is unstable
under conditions encountered in the gastrointestinal tract. A
variety of coatings and encapsulation methods have been
developed in the art, but only a few are effective in address-
ing this issue, Still, there are therapeutic compounds that
tend to be less active in the conditions of the gastrointestinal
tract and must be administered in higher dosages to be
adsorbed into the bloodstream in an effective amount.

[0004] A broad range of drug formulation systems have
been developed to address the problem of optimal drug
delivery and are based on incorporation of drug into a matrix
that acts as a carrier. Factors considered in drug formulation
include requirements that the system be non-toxic and
non-reactive with the drug to be delivered, economical to
manufacture, formed of readily available components, and
consistent with respect to ﬁnal composition and physical
characteristics, including stability and release rate. It is also
preferable that the drug delivery system is formed of mate-
rials easily removed from the body by normal physiologic
processes.

[0005] Advancements in microparticle technology have
aided in the development of improved drug formulations
However, despite these advances there is still a need in the
art for stable drug formulations having long term effective-
ness and optimal adsorption when administered as a phar-
maceutical, particularly by pulmonary means, One approach
in addressing this deﬁciency is to target the structural
characteristics/properties of the active agent that would
promote its adsorption to the microparticle surface and
decrease its tendency to remain in solution.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0006] Methods are provided for binding, coating or
adsorbing an active agent onto a crystalline microparticle
surface. In general, microparticles are coated with an active
agent by modifying the system comprising the micropar-
ticles and the dissolved active agent such that the active
agent has a greater aﬂinity for the microparticle surface than
for remaining in solution. In particular the present invention
seeks to further promote the adsorption of an active agent to
the microparticle surface by modifying/utilizing the proper-
ties of the active agent under a number of conditions in
solution,

[0007] Thus, in the present invention there is provided a
method for promoting binding of an active agent to a
preformed crystalline microparticle in suspension compris-
ing the steps of: i) modifying the chemical potential of the
active agent wherein the modifying allows for an energeti-
cally favorable interaction between the active agent and
microparticle independent of removal of solvent; and ii)
adsorbing the active agent onto the surface of the micropar-
ticle.

[0008] In particular embodiments ofthe present invention,
modifying the chemical potential comprises modifying the
structure, ﬂexibility, rigidity, solubility or stability of the
active agent, individually or in combination, Modifying the
chemical potential of the active agent comprises altering
solution conditions. Altering solution conditions comprises
adding an active agent modiﬁer to the solution.

[0009] In particular embodiments, the active agent modi-
ﬁer is selected from the group consisting of salts, surfac-
tants, ions, osmolytes, alcohols, chaotropes, kosmotropes,
acids, bases, and organic solvents. In one embodiment, the
salt is sodium chloride,

[0010] In still yet another embodiment of the present
invention, the method further comprises the step of dissolv-
ing the active agent in the ﬂuid phase of a suspension of
microparticles and changing the pH of the ﬂuid phase, In one
aspect the step of dissolving the active agent in a ﬂuid phase
refers to the dissolving of a solid. In another aspect the step
of dissolving the active agent refers to the addition of a
concentrated solution of the active agent.

[0011] In another embodiment of the present invention,
the active agent modiﬁer improves the structural stability of
the active agent,

[0012] In yet another embodiment of the present invention
the active agent is a protein, peptide, polypeptide, small
molecule, or nucleic acid molecule. In another embodiment
of the present invention the active agent is selected from the
group consisting of insulin, ghrelin, growth hormone, and
parathyroid hormone (PTH), The active agent can comprise
an antibody or antibody fragment. In various aspects of the
invention the antibody can recognize a disease-associated
antigen including, without limitation, a tumor-associated
antigen or an infectious pathogen-related antigen.

[0013] In still yet another embodiment of the present
invention, the small molecule is an ionizable molecule or a
hydrophobic molecule such as, but not limited to,
cyclosporin A.

[0014] In another embodiment of the present invention,
modifying the chemical potential of the active agent com-
prises modulating one or more energetically favorable inter-
actions such as, but not limited to, electrostatic interactions,
hydrophobic interactions, and/or hydrogen bonding interac-
tions between the active agent and the microparticle surface.

aminobutyl)-2,5-diketopiperazine;
aminobutyl)—2,5-diketopiperazine; 3,6-di(oxalyl-4-
aminobutyl)—2,5-diketopiperazine and derivatives
therefrom. Diketopiperazine salts may also be utilized in the
present invention and may included, for example, a phar-
maceutically acceptable salt such as the Na, K, Li, Mg, Ca,
ammonium, or mono-, di- or tri-alkylammonium (as derived
from triethylamine, butylamine, diethanolamine, trietha-
nolamine, or pyridines, and the like). The salt may be a
mono-, di-, or mixed salt. Higher order salts are also
contemplated for diketopiperazines in which the R groups
contain more than one acid group. In other aspects of the
invention, a basic form of the agent may be mixed with the
diketopiperazine in order to form a salt linkage between the
drug and the diketopiperazine, such that the drug is a counter
cation of the diketopiperazine. DKP salts for drug delivery
are disclosed in a further detail in US. Patent Application
Publication No. 20060040953 which is herein incorporated
by reference in its entirety.

[0035] U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,444,226, and 6,652,885, each
herein incorporated by reference in their entirety, describe
preparing and providing microparticles of DKP in aqueous
suspension to which a solution of active agent is added, and
then the critical step of lyophilizing the suspension to yield
microparticles having a coating of active agent. The basis for
this fonnulation is that the coating of microparticle with
active agent is driven by removal of the liquid medium by
lyophilization. (See also US. Pat. No. 6,440,463 which is
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). In contrast
to teachings in the prior art, the present invention provides
means for adjusting the association of active agent with the
microparticle prior to solvent removal. Thus, removal of the
liquid medium by bulk physical methods (e.g., ﬁltration or
sedimentation) or evaporative methods (e.g., lyophilization
or spray-drying) can result in comparable loads.

Promoting Adsorption of Active Agents

[0036] Adsorbing active agent to the surface of a crystal-
line microparticle can involve altering the properties of the
active agent in a solution or ﬂuid suspension under various
solution conditions, thereby promoting adsorption to the
microparticle surface and reducing the amount of active
agent remaining in solution. Alteration or modiﬁcations to
the active agent may occur with the use of modiﬁers such as,
but not limited to, chaotropes and kosmotropes, salts, organ-
ics such as, but not limited to, alcohols, osmolytes, and
surfactants These modiﬁers can act on the active agent to
alter its chemical potential and thereby its structure, ﬂex-
ibility, rigidity or stability, without chemically altering the
agent itself. The term “chemical potential” is well known to
one of ordinary skill. In embodiments of the present inven-
tion, “chemical potential” refers to the free energy necessary
to drive a chemical reaction such as, for example, interaction
between an active agent and a solvent or the adsorption of
active agent onto a microparticle. The term “energetically
favorable” as used herein refers to the lowering of the free
energy levels of the absorbed states of the active agent onto
the microparticle in relation to the free energy level of
uncoated microparticle, or unbound active agent and/or the
insoluble forms (including aggregation or precipation) of the
active agent. The term “structure” as used herein refers to the
secondary structure of the active agent molecule and
includes the alpha-helical formation, beta sheets, or random
coil (unordered) of the active agent molecule, such as a

Jan. 3], 2019

protein. Additionally, the term structure may also include
teritary and quaternary structures of the molecule but is not
limited to such and may also refer to the self association,
aggregation, multimerization, dimerization, and the like, of
a molecule. The term “stability" as used herein refers to the
stabilization or destabilization of the structure of the active
agent in the presence of the modiﬁer.

[0037] In addition, altering the properties of the active
agent in a solution or ﬂuid suspension are likely to aﬁect the
interactions due to hydrophobic properties, hydrogen bond-
ing properties, and electrostatic properties of the active agent
and/or micropar‘ticle.

[0038] Hydrophobic interactions are associations of non-
polar groups with each other in aqueous solutions because of
their insolubility in water. Hydrophobic interactions can
affect a number of molecular processes including, but not
limited to, structure stabilization (of single molecules, com-
plexes of two or three molecules, or larger assemblies) and
dynamics, and make important contributions to protein-
protein and protein-ligand binding processes. These inter-
actions are also known to play a role in early events of
protein folding, and are involved in complex assembly and
self-assembly phenomena (e.g., formation of membranes).

[0039] Hydrogen bonding interactions are especially
strong dipole-dipole forces between molecules; a hydrogen
atom in a polar bond (e.g., HiF, H40 or HiN) can
experience an attractive force with a neighboring electro-
negative molecule or ion, which has an unshared pair of
electrons (typically an F, O, or N atom on another molecule).
Hydrogen bonds are responsible for the unique properties of
water and are very important in the organization of biologi-
cal molecules, especially in inﬂuencing the structure of
proteins and DNA.

[0040] Electrostatic interactions are attractions between
opposite charges or repulsions between like charges that
grow stronger as the charges come closer to each other.
Electrostatic interactions constitute a key component in
understanding interactions between charged bodies in ionic
solutions. For example, the stability of colloidal particles
dispersed in a solvent can be explained by considering the
competition between repulsive electrostatic interactions and
the attractive van der Waals interactions. Electrostatic inter-
actions are also of importance when considering interaction
and adhesion between particles.

Salts

[0041] In some embodiments of the present invention, the
properties of the active agent are altered using a salt such as,
but not limited to, sodium chloride. Active agents, for
example, PTH and GLP-1, undergo noticeable structural
changes in the presence of salt. As shown in Example 5
(FIG. 4D), the presence of salt increases the secondary
structure of PTH by promoting a more helical conformation
of the peptide. Salt has also been shown to aEect the
structure of GLP—1, as disclosed in US. Provisional Patent
Application, Ser. No. 60/744,882, ﬁled onApr. 14, 2006 and
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. Furthermore,
salts and other ionic compounds are capable of either
stabilizing or destabilizing proteins and peptides, especially
when the diﬁerence between the pH of the solution and the
pI of the protein or peptide becomes greater, by binding to
speciﬁcally charged residues (Antosiewiez J, et al., J. Mol.
Biol. 238:415-436, 1994).
US 2019/0029961 A1

[0028] Generally, most active agents can be coated or
adsorbed onto the surface of crystalline microparticles
including, but not limited to, organic macromolecules,
nucleic acids, synthetic organic compounds, polypeptides,
peptides, proteins, polysaccharides and other sugars, and
lipids. Peptides, proteins, and polypeptides are all chains of
amino acids linked by peptide bonds. Peptides are generally
considered to be less than 30 amino acid residues but may
include more. Proteins are polymers that can contain more
than 30 amino acid residues. The term polypeptide as is
know in the art and as used herein, can refer to a peptide, a
protein, or any other chain of amino acids of any length
containing multiple peptide bonds, though generally con-
taining at least 10 amino acids. The active agents used in the
coating formulation can fall under a variety of biological
activity classes, such as vasoactive agents, neuroactive
agents, hormones, anticoagulants, immunomodulating
agents, cytotoxic agents, antibiotics, antivirals, antigens, and
antibodies.

[0029] Examples of active agents that may be employed in
the present invention include, in a non-limiting manner:
growth hormone, antibodies and fragments thereof alkynes,
cyclosporins (e.g. cyclosporin A), PPACK (D-phenylalanyl-
L-prolyl-L-arginine chloromethyl ketone, CMFDA (5-chlo-
romethylfluorescein diacetate), Texas Red, clopiogrel,
granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-
CSF), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-l), ghrelin, parathyroid
hormone (PTH), insulin and insulin analogs (e.g., aspart
insulin and insulin) and antibodies and fragments thereof,
including, but not limited to: humanized or chimeric anti-
bodies; F(ab), F(ab)2, or single-chain antibody alone or
fused to other polypeptides; therapeutic or diagnostic mono-
clonal antibodies to cancer antigens, cytokines, infectious
agents, inﬂammatory mediators, hormones, and cell surface
antigens. Non-limiting examples of antibodies to tumor
antigens include anti-SSX-24l-49 (synovial sarcoma, X
breakpoint 2), anti-NY-ESO-l (esophageal tumor associated
antigen), anti-PRAME (preferentially expressed antigen of
melanoma), anti-PSMA (prostate-speciﬁc membrane anti-
gen), anti-Melan-A (melanoma tumor associated antigen),
anti-tyrosinase (melanoma tumor associated antigen), and
anti-MOPC-21 (myeloma plasma-cell protein),

Microparticles

[0030] Essentially, the term “microparticle" refers to a
particle with a diameter of about 0.5-1000 @m, irrespective
of the precise exterior or interior structure. Within the broad
category of microparticles, “microspheres” refers to
microparticles with uniform spherical shape. Crystalline
microparticles as used herein refers to microparticles that
have the internal structure, though not necessarily the exter-
nal form, of a crystal and have a regular arrangement of
atoms in a space lattice. Ionizable crystalline surfaces refer
to crystalline microparticles that have the additional capacity
to carry an electrical charge. In some embodiments the
microparticle can be a single regularly shaped crystal. In
various preferred embodiments the microparticle is irregu-
larly shaped, is porous, has dissolved active agent-accessible
interior surfaces, or comprises multiple crystals, in any
combination. Such characteristics will generally increase
surface area and thereby loading capacity. Such character-
istics can also contribute to advantageous aerodynamic
properties, important if the active agent is to be delivered by
inhalation of a dry powder comprising the microparticles.

Jan. 31, 2019

[0031] Preferably, the chemical substance composing the
crystalline microparticle is reversibly reactive with the
active agent to be delivered, non-toxic, as well as non-
metabolized by rodents and humans, The foregoing notwith-
standing, some levels of toxicity are tolerable, depending,
for example, on the severity of the condition to be treated or
the amount of the substance to which a patient is exposed.
Similarly, it is not required that the substance be completely
metabolically inert. In addition, the crystalline structure of
preferred microparticles is not substantially disrupted in the
process of coating or binding with active agent. The com-
position of the crystalline microparticle determines what
type of chemical interactions can be manipulated to drive
adsorption of an active agent to the microparticle surface.

[0032] A number of substances can be used to form
crystalline microparticles. Microparticles as such have sur-
faces, the properties of which can be manipulated in the
coating process as disclosed in copending US. patent appli-
cation Ser. No. 11/532,063 (Attomey Docket No. 51300-
00025), ﬁled on the same date as the instant application, and
US, Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/717,524 ﬁled on
Sep. 14, 2005, each of which is hereby incorporated by
reference in its entirety. Representative materials from
which crystalline microparticles can be formed include, but
are not limited to, aromatic amino acids, or compounds with
limited solubility in a deﬁned pH range such as diketopip-
erazines and morpholine sulfates.

[0033] One particular example of microparticles as con-
templated in the present invention are diketopiperazine
(DKP) microparticles. As discussed herein, DKP micropar-
ticles are employed to facilitate the adsorption of the active
agent. US. Pat. Nos. 5,352,461 and 5,503,852, each of
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety,
describe a drug delivery system based on formation of
diketopiperazine (DKP) microparticles from diketopipera-
zine derivatives such as 3,6-bis[N-fumaryl-N-(n-butyl)
amino] (also referred to as fumaryl diketopiperazine or
FDKP; also termed (E)—3,6-bis[4-(N-carboxy-2-propeny1)
amidobutyl]-2,5-diketopiperazine) that are stable at low pH
and dissolve at the pH of blood or the small intestine. A
system based on diketopiperazine structural elements or one
of its substitution derivatives, including, but not limited to,
diketomorpholines and diketodioxanes, forms micropar-
ticles with desirable size distributions and pH ranges as well
as good payload tolerance. A wide range of stable, repro-
ducible characteristics can be generated with appropriate
manipulations of the substituent groups. These patents dis-
closed precipitation of the DKP in the presence of the active
agent to form microparticles comprising the active agent.
Further details for synthesis, preparation, and use of dike-
topiperazines and diketopiperazine microparticles are dis-
closed in US. Pat. Nos. 6,071,497; 6,331,318; 6,428,771

zine (succinyl diketopiperazine or SDKP); 3,6-di(maleyl-4-

US 2019/0029961 A1

Chaotropes

[0042] Chaotropes, as are well known in the art, are ions
that exhibit weak interactions with water and therefore
destabilize molecules such as proteins or peptides These
compounds break down the hydrogen-bonded network of
water and decrease its surface tension, thus promoting more
structural freedom and denaturation of proteins and pep-
tides. Examples of chaotropes include, but are not limited to,
NaSCN, (CHS)3N7HCI, NaZNOE, and NaClO4 and cesium
chloride (CsCl).

[0043] Kosmotropes or lyotropes, on the other hand, are
ions that display strong interactions with water and generally
stabilize macromolecules such as proteins and peptides. This
stabilization effect is brought about by increasing the order
of water and increasing its surface tension. Examples of
kosmotropes include, but are not limited to, sodium citrate
(Na Citrate), and sodium sulfate (NaZSO4).

Alcohols

[0044] Another class of modiﬁer of active agent employed
in the present invention is alcoholsi Alcohols are able to
disrupt the native structure of proteins and peptides and are
also able to stabilize and induce @-helical conformations in
macromolecules, most notably within unstructured proteins
and polypeptides, Such alcohols may include, but are not
limited to, methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), triﬂuoroetha-
nol (TFE), and hexaﬁuoroisopropanol (HFIP). Of those,
TFE and HFIP are two of the most potent alcohols for
inducing helical transitions in peptides and proteins (Hirota
et al., Protein Sci, 6:416-421; 1997, incorporated herein by
reference for all it contains regarding helical transitions in
peptides and proteins), These alcohols may affect the struc-
ture of proteins and peptides through their ability to disrupt
the hydrogen-bonding properties of the solvent (see Eggers
and Valentine, Protein Sci, 10:250-261; 2001, incorporated
herein by reference for all it contains regarding the effect of
alcohols on the structure of proteins).

Osmolytes

[0045] Another class of modiﬁer that affects the active
agent affinity for the microparticle is osmolytes. Osmolytes,
as are well known to the skilled artisan, are small com-
pounds that are produced by the cells of most organisms in
high stress situations (such as extreme temperature ﬂuctua-
tions, high salt environments, etc.) to stabilize their macro-
molecules. They do not interact with the macromolecule
directly but act by altering the solvent properties in the
cellular environment and so their presence indirectly modi-
ﬁes the stability of proteins. These compounds include
various polyols, sugars, polysaccharides, organic solvents,
and various amino acids and their derivatives. Although the
mechanism of osmolytes are yet to be elucidated, it is
speculated that these compounds likely act by raising the
chemical potential of the denatured state relative to the
native state, thereby increasing the (positive) Gibbs energy
difference (AG) between the native and denatured
ensembles (Arakawa and Timashetf, Biochemistry 29:1914-
1923; 1990),

[0046] Osmolytes as contemplated in the present inven-
tion, include in a non-limiting manner, hexylene-glycol
(Hex-Gly), trehalose, glycine, polyethylene glycol (PEG),
trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), mannitol, and proline.

General Description of the Method

[0047] In the methods of the present invention, at least
three components are combined in a liquid medium: at least
one active agent, (prefomed) microparticles, and at least
one active agent modiﬁer as described above, The compo-
nents of this system may be combined in any order. In some
embodiments the modiﬁer and active agent are combined
with each other prior to that mixture being combined with a
suspension of microparticles. In other embodiments the
agent and microparticles are ﬁrst combined and then the
modiﬁer is added, In some embodiments the active agent or
modiﬁer is provided and combined with another component,
or components, as a solution. In other embodiments any of
the components can be provided in solid form and dissolved,
or in the case of the microparticles, suspended, in the liquid
medium containing another of the components, Further
variations will be apparent to one of skill in the art,
[0048] The microparticles are formed prior to being com-
bined with the other components of the system, and as such
are present as a suspension. Nonetheless the liquid medium
in which the microparticles are suspended is at times
referred to herein as a solvent, The liquid medium utilized in
the method is most often aqueous, However in some
instances the liquid medium can comprise more of an
organic compound, for example an alcohol used as a modi-
ﬁer, than it does water.

[0049] Upon assembly of all components of the system,
the active agent will adsorb to the surface of the micropar-
ticle. In increasingly preferred embodiments of the present
invention, at least 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 95%, or substantially
all, of the active agent in the system will adsorb to the
microparticles, up to 100%. In some embodiments of the
present invention, the accessible surface area of the
microparticles with be sufﬁcient for all of the adsorbed
active agent to be in direct contact with the microparticle
surface, that is, the coating is a monolayer However it is to
be understood that additional interactions can be present. In
some instances, for example, self-association of the active
agent can also be energetically favored so that multiple
layers of active agent coat the particle. It is not required that
any of these layers be complete or that the thickness of the
coating be uniform Two forms of self-association can be
recognized: multimerization and aggregation. Multimeriza-
tion is characterized by speciﬁc intermolecular interactions
and ﬁxed stoichiometry. Aggregation is characterized by
unspeciﬁc intermolecular interactions and undeﬁned stoichi-
ometry. It should be understood that multirneric active
agents can be adsorbed in the multimerie state, or dissoci-
ated into monomers, or lower order multimers, and adsorbed
to the surface in that state. In either case aggregation can
mediate layering of the active agent onto the microparticle.
[0050] The loaded microparticles constitute a drug deliv-
ery composition that can be utilized in a variety of forms.
The particles can be used as powders, in solid dosage forms
such as tablets or contained in capsules, or suspended in a
liquid carrier. Generally this will require exchange and/or
removal of the liquid medium in which the loading took
place. This can be accomplished by any of a variety of
means including physical methods such as, but not limited
to, sedimentation or ﬁltration, and evaporative methods such
as, but not limited to, lyophilization or spray-drying These
techniques are known to those skilled in the art. In one
embodiment of the present invention, solvent is removed by
spray-drying. Methods of spray-drying diketopiperazine

microparticles are disclosed in, for example, US. Provi-
sional Patent Application No. 60/776,605 ﬁled on Feb. 22,
2006, incorporated by reference herein for all it contains
regarding spray-drying diketopiperazine microparticles.
[0051] If loading is not substantially complete, embodi-
ments of the invention, using physical methods of solvent
removal will typically loose the unadsorbed active agent, but
for example can be useful to ensure that coating does not
progress beyond a monolayer. Conversely, embodiments
using evaporative drying for solvent removal can in some
cases deposit additional active agent on the particle and
thereby avoid its loss, but the adsorptive interactions
involved can ditfer from those established by the molecules
bound in the earlier steps of the method, In other embodi-
ments evaporative solvent removal does not result in sig-
niﬁcant further deposition of active agent, including the case
in which substantially all of the active agent was already
adsorbed to the particle.

EXAMPLES

[0052] The following examples are included to demon-
strate preferred embodiments of the present invention, It
should be appreciated by those of skill in the art that the
techniques disclosed in the examples which follow represent
techniques discovered by the inventor to function well in the
practice of the invention, and thus can be considered to
constitute preferred modes for its practice. While discussion
may focus on a particular mechanism it should be under-
stood that some modiﬁers can have multiple effect on the
agent, or indeed on the particle surface as well, each of
which can contribute to promoting adsorption of the agent to
the particle. However, those of skill in the art, in light ofthe
present disclosure, will appreciate that many changes can be
made in the speciﬁc embodiments which are disclosed and
still obtain a like or similar result without departing from the
spirit and scope of the invention.

Example 1

Experimental Procedure: Active Agent/FDKP
Microparticle Adsorption Studies

[0053] The active agents insulin, PTH, ghrelin and GLP-1
were either purchased from American Peptide (Sunnyvale,
Calif) or AnaSpec (San Jose, Calif), or prepared in house
(MannKind Corporation, Valencia, Calif). Aqueous samples
at varying pH and at 20° C. (unless otherwise noted) were
analyzed. Samples were generally prepared fresh and were
mixed with the particular additive (e.g., salt, pH buffer, etc.,
if any), prior to the addition of FDKP microparticles.
[0054] The association of active agent with diketopipera-
zine (DKP) particles in suspension was evaluated by con-
ducting adsorption studies. The parameters investigated in
the adsorption studies explored the effects of electrostatic
interactions, hydrogen bonding, water structure, protein
ﬂexibility, and speciﬁc salt-pairing interactions on the active
agent/fumaryl diketopiperazine (FDKP)micropartic1einter-
action, In addition, several common protein stabilizers were
tested for interference with active agent adsorption to FDKP
microparticle surfaces

[0055] Varying conditions promoting adsorption of active
agent onto the surfaces of preformed FDKP particles were
studied. A 15 mg/mL FDKP microparticle suspension was
combined with 3po buffer and 3x solution of an additive

or excipient. The ﬁnal solution contained a FDKP micropar-
ticle concentration of 5 mg/mL and a GLP-l concentration
of 0.25 mg/mL (5% w/w), or a PTH concentration of 0.25
mg/mL (5% w/w), or an insulin concentration of 0.75
mg/mL (15% w/w) or a ghrelin concentration of 0. 1 0 mg/mL
(2% w/w). Unbound active agent in the supernatant was
ﬁltered off the suspension. The FDKP particles with the
associated active agent were dissolved (reconstituted) in 100
mM ammonium bicarbonate and ﬁltered to separate out any
aggregated active agent molecules. The amount of active
agent in both the supernatant and reconstituted fractions was
quantitated by HPLC. A series of experiments were con-
ducted in which conditions employed included use of addi-
tives such as salts, osmolytes, Chaotropes and kosmotropes,
and alcohols. The results from these studies are described
below.

Example 2

Etfect of Chaotropes and Kosmotropes on
Adsorption of Active Agent onto FDKP Particles

[0056] Ionic species that affect the structure of water and
proteins (Chaotropes and kosmotropes) were studied to
investigate the adsorption of active agent onto a FDKP
microparticle surface by a hydrophobic mechanism (at low
pH). Loading of the active agent onto FDKP particles was
performed at 5 mg/mL microparticles and a GLP-1 concen-
tration of 0.25 mg/mL (5% w/w), or a PTH concentration of
0.25 mg/mL (5% w/w), or an insulin concentration of 0.75
mg/mL (15% \v/w)i The concentration of the chaotrope or
kosmotrope in the samples was held constant at 100 mM and
the pH varied from 2.0 to 5.0. Chaotropes or kosmotropes
were selected from the following: NaSCN, CsCl, Na2S04,
(CH3)3N7HC1, Na2N03, Na Citrate, and NaC104, The
control indicates no chaotrope or kosmotrope were added.
[0057] FIGS. 1A-1C depict the loading curves for insulin,
GLP-1 and PTH respectively, onto the FDKP microparticle
surface as a function of pH in the presence of the various
Chaotropes or kosmotropes At low pH (3 ,0) all Chaotropes
and kosmotropes analyzed improved the aﬂinity of insulin
for the microparticle surface and showed signiﬁcant loading
compared to the control. At pH 4, this effect was not
observed (FIG. 1A). At higher pH (5.0), the Chaotropes and
kosmotropes interfered with the adsorption of insulin to the
microparticle surface, as compared to control, by precipi-
tating the insulin protein. Thus these agents promoted bind-
ing of insulin to the FDKP particles at lower pH, but have
little or even a detrimental effect at the higher pH conditions.
[0058] GLP-1, in the presence of Chaotropes and kosmo-
tropes, showed an improved aﬂinity for the FDKP micropar-
ticles at pH 20-40 with a greater effect at lower pH (FIG.
1B). Similar observations were disclosed in US. Provisional
Application Ser. No. 60/744,882. There it was noted, that
approximately 0.02-0.04 mg/mL of the GLP-1 peptide
(which corresponds to mass ratios of 0,004 to 0,008) was
detected in the reconstituted microparticle-free control
samples in the presence of NaSCN, NaClO4, NaZSOA,
NaNO3 and Na citrate, indicating that a small proportion of
the GLP-l precipitated rather than adsorbing to the particle.
[0059] The aﬂinity of PTH for the FDKP microparticle
surface was greater at pH of 4.0 to about 4.5 in the presence
of strong Chaotropes NaSCN and NaClO4 (FIG. 1C).
[0060] The data supports that chaotropic and kosmotropic
agents play a role in promoting adsorption of the active

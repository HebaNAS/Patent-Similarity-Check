FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0002] The present invention relates to a modiﬁed release
formulation of antiepileptic drug. The formulation of the
present invention comprises lacosamide or pharmaceutically
acceptable salts. esters, metabolites, prodrugs or enantiom-
ers thereof and modiﬁed release polymer.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] The term epilepsy is derived from a Greek word
meaning a condition of being seized or overcome. The term
epilepsy designates a group of central nervous system dis-
orders having in common the occurrence of sudden and
transitory episodes of abnormal behavioral symptoms of
motor sensory, autonomic or psychic origin. Epilepsies have
a deﬁnite onset and ending, and they usually are of short
duration.

[0004] Epileptic seizures are mainly of two types: partial
seizures and generalized seizures. Partial seizures can again
be of three type; i.e. simple partial, complex partial and
partial with secondarily generalized tonic clonic seizure.
Generalized seizures are classiﬁed as absence seizure, myo-
clonic seizure and tonic-clonic seizure. Anti-epileptic drug
are vital in preventing ﬁts for people with epilepsy, thereby
greatly enhancing quality of life.

[0005] Based on their mechanism of action, anti-epileptic
drugs can be classiﬁed as sodium channel blockers, calcium
current inhibitors, gamma-aminobutyrlc acid (GABA)
enhancers, glutamate blockers, carbonic anhydrase inhibi-
tors etc.

[0006] Dmgs such as acetazolamide, carbamazepine,
clobazam, clonazepam, ethosuximide, gabapentin, lam-
otrigine, levetiracetarn, oxcarbazepine, phenobarbital (phe-

vigabatrin, zonisamide, valpromide, divalproex sodium,
gabapentin, felhamate, fosphenytoin and the like are used
for the treatment of epilepsy.

[0007] Anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs) are also promising
agents for the prevention of migraine and other head pain.
Migraine and epilepsy share several clinical features and
respond to many of the same pharmacological agents, sug-
gesting that similar mechanisms may be involved in their
pathophysiology.

[0008] The most common side effects associated with
epilepsy medicines are drowsiness, irritability, nausea, rash,
and clumsiness. Some drugs produce changes in emotions,
memory or behavior, or aﬁect learning Modiﬁed release
formulations of anti-epileptic drugs provides reduction in
the above mentioned side eﬁects, increased patient compli-
ance, avoids a typical peak-valley plasma concentration
proﬁle and ultimately reduction in the precipitation of

adverse effects especially of a drug with a narrow therapeu-
tic index whenever overmedication occurs.

[0009] Lacosamide, marketed as Vimpat®, is approved in
US for the treatment of partial-onset seizure in patient with
epilepsy aged 17 years and older. The lacosamide may be
used for the treatment or prophylaxis of migraine, ﬁbro-
myalgia syndrome, osteoarthritis, post herpetic neuralgia
and painful diabetic neuropathy. Chemically lacosamide is
(2R)-2-(acetylamino)—3-methoxy-N-(phenylmethyl)pro-
panamide, R-enantiomer is at least 10-fold more active than
the S-enantiomer. US. Pat. No. 5,654,301 discloses amino-
acid derivative, lacosamide exhibiting anticonvulsant prop-
erties. RE 38,551 discloses the novel enantiomeric com-
pounds one of which is lacosamide.

[0010] Vimpat® is approved for oral or intravenous
administration. Lacosamide for oral use has the initial dose
of 50 mg twice daily (100 mg per day). It can be increased
at weekly intervals by 100 mg/day (two divided doses) up to
the recommended maintenance dose of 200 to 400 mg/day,
based on individual patient response and tolerability. The
marketed formulation Vimpat® is an immediate release
formulation for BID administration

[0011] The side effect associated with lacosamide is simi-
lar to other epileptics as dizziness, ataxia, vomiting, diplo-
pia, nausea, vertigo and vision blurred.

[0012] There exists a need for modiﬁed release formula-
tion of lacosamide which controls the release of lacosamide
in such a manner that therapeutically eﬂective concentration
is maintained in the blood for an extended period of time
keeping the drug concentration in the blood substantially
constant. The use of modiﬁed release formulations of lacos-
amide would improve patient compliance as it reduces the
numbers of dosages to be taken per day.

[0013] With the modiﬁed release formulation, the therapy
may be continued without interrupting the sleep of the
patient, which is of special importance when treating an
epileptic patient to prevent nocturnal seizures, or patients
with pain who experience severe pain on awakening. as well
as for debilitated patients for whom an uninterrupted sleep
is essential.

[0014] Thus the modiﬁed release formulation of lacos-
amide would provide a modiﬁed release of lacosamide with
minimal Cm“ to Cmm peak to trough variation over a period
of at least 12 hrs. It is preferred that the modiﬁed release
formulation of lacosamide is capable of maintaining a
substantially constant plasma level of lacosamide for at least
12 hrs.

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0015] In one embodiment, the modiﬁed release formula-
tion of lacosamide comprises lacosamide and modiﬁed
release polymer.

[0016] In other embodiment, the modiﬁed release formu-
lation of lacosamide further comprises core comprising
lacosamide and modiﬁed release coating.

mulation of lacosamide releases not more than about 25% of
lacosamide within 1 hour, from about 30% to about 70% of

[0212] Clinical Study for Lacosamide Tablets of Example
03:

[0213] A single dose study was conducted in healthy
human volunteers to assess bioavailability of lacosamide
formulated as the 200 mg QD modiﬁed release tablets of
Examples 3 by comparison with a reference treatment with
Vimpat® 100 mg tablet BID (each tablet containing lacos-
amide 100 mgione tablet each 12 hourly) manufactured for
UCB, GA, administered under fed conditions in healthy,
adult, male, human subjects in a randomized cross over
study and to evaluate safety and tolerability of lacosamide
when its absorption proﬁle is altered as in these modiﬁed
release tablets.

[0214] The study design was open label, balanced, ran-
domized, three treatment, three sequence, three-period,
single dose crossover bioequivalence study in 12 healthy,
adult, male, human subjects under fed conditions.

[0215] The pharmacokinetic parameters AUCD_72, AUCO_
m, CW”, and Tm>6 were estimated during the study.

tions over the 72-hour assessment period are shown in FIG.

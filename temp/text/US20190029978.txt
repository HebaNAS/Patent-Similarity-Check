Lip-C6 Inhibits TLR2- and TLR4-Induced Neutrophil
Activation

[0083] We examined the effect of Lip-C6 on TLR-induced
neutrophil CXC chemokine production. Ahuman neutrophil
cell line (HL-60) was stimulated in vitro with S. aureus or
LPS, and CXCLS/IL-8 production was measured by ELISA.
As shown in FIG. 9A, CXCL8/IL-8 is produced by the
human neutrophil cell line in response to S. aureus or LPS
stimulation; however, pre-incubation with Lip-C6 signiﬁ-
cantly inhibits CXC production compared with ghost lipo-
some.

[0084] As CXC chemokine production by neutrophils
likely mediates further neutrophil inﬁltration to the corneal
stroma and subsequent development of keratitis, we also
examined the effect of Lip-C6 on an enriched (>98%)
population of mouse peritoneal neutrophils. As shown in
FIGS. 9B and C, pre-incubation of murine neutrophils with
ghost liposomes or Lip-C6 conﬁrmed the results with human
neutrophils (FIG. 9A), with Lip-C6 inhibiting TLR2- and
TLR4-induced CXCLl and CXCL2 production in a dose
dependent manner.

[0085] Statistical analysis was performed using an
unpaired t-test (Prism; Graph Pad Soﬁware. San Diego,
Calif). A p value of less than 0.05 was considered signiﬁ-
cant.

CERAMIDE COMPOSITION AND METHOD
OF USE

[0001] This application is a divisional application of US.
application Ser. No. 11/773,989 ﬁled Jul. 6, 2007 which
claims the beneﬁt of US. Provisional Application No.
60/806,655 ﬁled Jul. 6, 2006, the contents of which are
hereby incorporated by reference in their entireties.

[0002] The work described herein was funded by NIH
grants ROEY14362 and P30EY11373, and a Sponsored
Research Agreement with Bausch and Lomb, Inc, with
additional support from EY015800, The Research to Prevent
Blindness Foundation and the Ohio Lions Eye Research
Foundation

BACKGROUND

[0003] Corneal inﬁltration and microbial keratitis are
caused by viruses, bacteria, fungi and parasites, and are
leading causes of visual impairment and blindness world-
wide. In addition, microbial products such as lipopolysac-
charide (LPS), bacterial cell walls, ﬁagellin or microbial
nucleic acid can induce corneal inﬂammation via Toll-like
receptors (TLR) on corneal epithelial cells. TLR/MyD88-
mediated CXC chemokine production and subsequent neu-
trophil inﬁltration to the corneal stroma and activation are
critical steps in the inﬂammatory response.

SUMMARY

[0004] The present invention, in one aspect, is directed to
a method for treating and/or preventing diseases associated
with neutrophil inﬁltration, which method comprises admin-
istering an effective amount of ceramide or ceramide deriva-
tive. In one embodiment, the method comprises treating
ocular disease such as keratitis, endophthalmitis, uveitis,
conjunctivitis, blepharitis, contact lens-induced peripheral
ulcer, corneal dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic ret-
inopathy, macular degeneration, ocular toxoplasmosis and
diseases resulting from complications from refractive or

laser surgery.

[0005] In one aspect of the invention, there is provided a
composition for treating and/or preventing diseases associ-
ated with neutrophil inﬁltration, the composition comprising
ceramide or ceramide derivative. In one embodiment, the

ceramide or ceramide derivative comprises C6-ceramide.
The ceramide or ceramide derivative may be delivered via a
particulate carrier, particularly, a liposome.

[0006] The administration route for treating and/or pre-
venting diseases associated with neutrophil inﬁltration may
be at least one of intravenous, intraperitoneal, intrathecal,
intralymphatic, intramuscular, intralesional, parenteral, epi-
dural, subcutaneous, pleural, topical, oral, nasal, anal, ocular
and otic. For ocular diseases, the administration route may
he one of topical, systemic, intravitreal and subconjunctival.

[0007] The ceramide or ceramide derivative inhibits mito-
gen-activated protein (MAP) kinases signaling, particularly
JNK and p38 signaling, which suppresses neutrophil recruit-
ment to the cell. The ceramide or ceramide derivative down
regulates chemotatic mediators (cytokines) that recruit neu-
trophils to the site of tissue injury via Toll-like and cytokine
receptors.

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE FIGUR 318

[0008] FIGS. 1A and 1B are bar graphs showing the dose
dependent effect of Lip-C6 on CXC chemokine human
corneal epithelial cells. FIG. 1A: Human corneal epithelial
cells (HCE-T) were pre-incubated 40 min. witi Lip-C6,
Lip-SIP, or control (ghost) liposomes, washed and stimu-
lated with inactivated S. aureus, which activates T 4R2 (Ref.
8). Alter 6 hours, supernatants were collected and CXCLI/
GRO-(x, CXCLS/ENA-78 and CXCLS/IL-S were measured
by ELISA. FIG. 1B: Primary human corneal epithelial cells
were isolated from donor corneas, and stimulatec with the
synthetic TLR2 agonist PamBCys in the presence of Lip-C6
or control, ghost liposomes. Lip-C6 inhibits c emokine
production. Values are mean+/—SD for triplicate wells, and
are representative of three independent experiments.
(m:medium alone.)
[0009] FIGS. 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D are bar graphs showing
the time-dependent effect of Lip-C6 on CXC c emokine
human corneal epithelial cells. FIGS 2A, 2B and 2C:
Human corneal epithelial cells (HCE-T) were pre-incubated
40 min with Lip-C6 or control (ghost) liposomes, washed
and stimulated with S. aureus. After 3 hrs, 6 hrs, or 12 hrs,
supernatants were collected and CXCLI/GRO-ot (‘16. 2A),
CXCLS/ENA-78 (FIG. 2B) and CXCL8/IL—8 (PIG. 2C)
were measured by ELISA. FIG. 2D: Primary human corneal
epithelial cells were isolated from donor corneas, pre-incu-
bated 40 min with Lip-C6 or control liposomes, and stimu-
lated with S. aureus. Supernatants were collected ter 3 hrs,
6 hrs or 12 hrs, and cytokines were measured.

[0010] FIG. 3 is a series of micrographs showing intrac-
ellular localization of Lip-C6. Human corneal epithelial
Ge] 5 were incubated with NBD labeled Lip-C6 (a), and were
counter-stained with either BodipyTM-labeled ceramide as a
Go gi marker (b, c) or Mito-Tracker red (d). Lip-C6 co-
localized with Golgi (panel 0). Final magniﬁcation using an
x63 objective with 16 further magniﬁcation is x1008.
[0011] FIGS. 4A and 4B show the effect of Lip-C6 on
HC 3 cell apopto sis. FIG. 4A: Human corneal epithelial cells
were incubated with DNase I, (positive control, panel a), or
wit Lip-C6 (panel c), and apoptosis was detected by
TUNEL assay. Panels b and d are corresponding DAPI
stained nuclei. FIG. 4B: Two hundred cells were counted,
anc the percent TUNEL positive cells is shown. Lip C6 did
not induce apoptosis in these cells.

[0012] FIG. 5 shows the elfect of Lip-C6 on p38 and INK
phosphorylation. Human corneal epithelial cells were incu-
bated with Lip-C6 or ghost liposomes for 30 min prior to
adc ition of S. aureus. After 6 hrs, cells were processed for
SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using Abs to phos-
phorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of p38 and .INK.
Bands were scanned by densitometry, and the ratio of
phosphorylated to non-phosphorylated forms were quanti-
ﬁec, and the mean+/—SEM of three independent experi-
ments is shown. Inhibition of P-p38 and P-JNK occurred
aﬁer incubation with Lip-C6.

[0013] FIGS. 6A and 6B show the effect of sub-conjunc-
tival and topical application of Lip-C6 on neutrophil recruit-
ment to the corneal stroma in mouse models of S aureus-
(FIG. 6A) and LPS- (FIG. 6B) induced corneal
inﬂammationi Lip-C6 or ghost liposomes were either
injected into the subconjunctival space, topically applied to
a 1 mm diameter region in the central cornea, or were
applied by both methods. Aﬁer 40 min, corneas were
stimulated with either inactivated S. aureus (FIG. 6A) or
US 2019/0029978 A1

LPS (FIG. 6B), and all were given a second topical appli-
cation of ghost or Lip-C6 after 6 hrs. After 24 hrs, eyes were
snap frozen and neutrophil numbers in a 5 urn corneal
section were determined alter immunostaining. Data points
represent individual corneas from each group of mice.
Comeas given Lip-C6 by each of these protocols had
signiﬁcantly less neutrophils than control ghost liposomes.
The experiment was repeated three times with similar
results.

[0014] FIG. 7 shows the effect of topical Lip-C6 on S.
aureus- and LPS-induced increased corneal thickness and
haze. A 1 mm diameter wound was made in the central
corneal stroma of C57BL/6 mice, and topical Lip-C6 was
given 1 hr before and 6 hrs after exposure to S, aureuix After
24 hrs, neutrophils were detected by imrnunohistochemistry,
comws were by in Vivo confocal microscopy, and corneal
thickness and haze were calculated as described in herein.
[0015] FIGS. 8A, 8B, 8C and 8D show the eifect of
Lip-C6 on corneal epithelial wound healing. A 1 mm diam-
eter comeal epithelial abrasion was generated, and corneas
were treated with topical Lip-C6 or ghost liposomes 40 min
prior to, and l and 6 h alter exposure to S. aureus. A2.5%
ﬂuorescein solution was added after 0 hr, 6 hrs or 24 hrs to
detect the epithelial wound, and the diameter was calculated
by image analysis. FIG. 8A: Representative images from
ﬁve mice per group. FIG. SB: Diameter of wound treated
with LipC6 or ghost liposomes (mean of ﬁve corneas). There
is no inhibitory eifect of Lip-C6 on the rate of wound
healing. FIG. 8C: Representative hematoxylin and eosin
stained corneal sections 6 hrs and 24 hrs after epithelial
abrasion and exposure to Lip-C6, At 6 hrs, the loss of
epithelium was noted and after 24 hrs, regeneration was
noted. No diiferences in epithelial regeneration were noted
among groups treated with Lip-C6 or controls (data not
shown). FIG. 8D: Corneal sections were stained with
TUNEL reagents (green) to determine the effect on apop-
tosis, and nuclei were stained with DAPI (blue). Shown are
representative sections of naive corneas (panel a) or corneal
sections after treatment with Lip-C6 and S. aureus (panel b).
TUN EL positive cells were detected in the stroma and not
the epithelium of S. aureus treated mice. These data are
representative of three independent experiments.

[0016] FIGS. 9A, 9B and 9C show the eifect of Lip-C6 on
TLR2 and TLR4-induced inﬂammation on human and
murine neutrophils. FIG. 9A: The human neutrophil cell line
(HL—60) was incubated with Lip-C6 or control (ghost gh)
liposornes 30 min prior to stimulation with S aureus or LPS.
After 6 hrs, CXCLS/IL-S in cell free supernatants was
measured by ELISA. Results are mean+/—SD of three rep-
licate wells, and data are representative of three independent
experiments. Lip-C6 inhibited CXC chemokine production
by TLR2 and TLR4 stimulated human neutrophils compared
with ghost liposomes. FIGS. 9B and 9C: Murine peritoneal
neutrophils (98% pure) were incubated overnight with S,
aureu: (FIG. 9B) or LPS (FIG. 9C) in the presence of
Lip-C6 or ghost liposomes, and CXCLl/KC, CXCLZ/MIP-2
were measured by ELISA. Results are mean+/—SD of three
replicate wells per sample, and data are representative of
three independent experiments.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[0017] The present invention, in one aspect, is directed to
a method for treating and/or preventing diseases associated
with neutrophil inﬁltration in a cell, which method com-

Jan. 3], 2019

prises administering to the cell an eifective amount of
ceramide or ceramide derivative. In one embodiment, the
disease is ocular disease, such as an anterior eye disease
including keratitis, endophthalmitis, uveitis, conjunctivitis,
blepharitis, contact lens-induced peripheral ulcer and cor-
neal dystrophy. The ocular disease may also be a disease of
the posterior eye, including retinitis pigmentosa, diabetic
retinopathy, macular degeneration and ocular toxoplasmo-
sis. In one embodiment, the ocular disease is a complication
resulting from refractive or laser surgery.

[0018] The administration route for administering the cer-
amide or ceramide derivative to the cell may be at least one
of intravenous, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intralymphatic,
intramuscular, intralesional, parenteral, epidural, subcutane-
ous, pleural, topical, oral, nasal, anal, ocular and otic. For
ocular diseases, the administration route may be one of
topical, systemic, intravitreal and subconjunctival.

[0019] In one aspect of the invention, there is provided a
composition for treating and/or preventing tissue injury or
diseases associated with neutrophil inﬁltration in a cell, the
composition comprising an effective amount of ceramide or
ceramide derivative. The composition inhibits mitogen-ac-
tivated protein (MAP) kinases signaling. The ceramide or
ceramide derivative downregulates chemotatic mediators
(cytokines) that recruit neutrophils to the site of tissue injury
via Toll-like and cytokine receptors.

[0020] Microbial keratitis caused by bacterial infection or
bacterial products is a leading cause of visual impairment,
and activates the host innate immune response through
pathogen recognition molecules, especially Toll-like recep-
tors (TLR). Activation of (TLR)2, TLR4 and TLR9 on
abraded corneal epithelium by bacterial lipoproteins
(T LR2), lipopolysaccharide (LPS, TLR4), or bacterial DNA
(T LR9) induces MyD88-dependent CXC chemokine pro-
duction and subsequent neutrophil inﬁltration to the corneal
stroma and development of corneal haze. In sterile corneal
inﬁltrates such as contact lens associated peripheral ulcer,
biopsy studies showed that neutrophils are the predominant
cells present in the corneal stroma.

[0021] Sphingolipid metabolites are a class of lipids that
serve both a structural role in membranes and induce intra-
cellular signaling. Ceram ides generally include a sphingoid
base linked to a fatty acid Via an amide bond. The term
“ceramide” as used herein refers to any N-acylsphingosine
including sphingolipids in which the sphingosine is acylate
with a fatty acid acyl CoA derivative to form an N-acyl-
sphingosine, Cerarn ides and ceramide derivatives include,
but are not limited to, derivatives of the SN-l position
including l-chloro and 1-benzoyl ceramides, which would
not be subject to phosphorylation at this position, as well as
derivatives at the SN-2 position (amide linkage), such as a
methylcarbamate group or a 2-0-ethyl substituent, which
would not be subject to degradation by ceramidases. In
addition, cell-permeable forms of these ceramides analogs
can be utilized. Examples of these cell-permeable ceramides
and/or derivatives contain 2-10 carbons and have short chain
fatty acids at the SN-2 position (C6 ceramide). An example
of CE-ceramide is N-Hexanoyl-D-erythro—Sphingosine.
[0022] Ceramides may be isolated from natural sources or
chemically synthesized. Cerarnide mediates cell differentia-
tion, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis. Intracellular ceramide
accumulation can lead to inhibition of Akt pro-survival
pathways and stimulation of caspase activity, resulting in
DNA fragmentation and cell death.

[0023] It has been previously demonstrated that C6 cer-
amide in liposome formulation (Lip-C6) induces apoptosis
of breast cancer cells and limits tumor growth. Despite the
documented role of ceramide in promoting apoptosis in
several cell types, this does not appear to be the mechanism
of action in microbial keratitis. The mechanism involves
inhibition of p38 and .INK phosphorylation, and resultant
CXC chemokine production, rather than promotion of epi-
thelial cell apoptosis. This conclusion is supported by our
ﬁndings that: 1) chemokine production by human corneal
epithelial cells in vitro is reduced in the absence of signiﬁ-
cant apoptosis; 2) activation of pro-inﬂammatory and pro-
apoptotic signaling cascades (JNK, p38) are inhibited in
HCE cells by Lip—C6; 3) chemokine production by murine
corneal epithelium in vivo is inhibited; 4) there is no
detectable apoptosis in corneal epithelium induced by C6 in
vitro or in vivo; and 5) neutrophil inﬁltration and develop-
ment of corneal haze is inhibited in Lip-C6 treated corneas
aﬂer TLR stimulationi

[0024] Ceramide in liposome formulation limits keratitis
by reducing activation and production of CXC chemokines
by corneal epithelial cells, and thereby limit recruitment of
neutrophils to the corneal stroma. This reduction in CXC
secretion may be due to Lip-C6 inhibiting pro-inﬂammatory
cascades that involve p38 and INK, In addition to corneal
epithelial cells, neutrophil activation is also inhibited by
ceramide, which represents a second target of anti—inﬂam-
matory activity.

[0025] This novel action of ceramide may also explain its
role in preconditioning. For example, TNF-a generated
ceramide induces tolerance to ischemia in astrocytes and
intravenous or intracisternal delivery of cell permeable
ceramide analogues reduce focal cerebral ischemia in SHR
rats, The neutophil inhibitory actions of ceramide, may be
due to ceramide-activated KSR (kinase suppressor of ras),
which minimizes the pro-inﬂammatory and apopotic effects
of TNF in an irritable bowel disease model. Alternatively, as
Akt signaling has been liked to TLR-inﬂammatory signal-
ing, ceramide may exert therapeutic actions through the
inhibition of Akt, Ceramide selectively interacts with protein
kinase C zeta, which inactivates AKT via phosphorylation of
Ser 34. In addition, ceramide can inhibit LPS/TLR4-induced
lL—8 synthesis in endothelial cells. As shown in atheroscle-
rotic and diabetic models, and conﬁrmed in the present study
using sphingosine-l-phosphate (SIP, FIG, 1), it is often the
phosphorylated or glycosylated ceramide metabolites, and
not ceramide itself, that mediates the pro-inflammatory
actions of sphinglolipids.

[0026] Topical application of C6-enriched 80 nm size
nanoliposomes is an effective therapeutic approach to cor-
neal inﬂammation induced by bacteria and bacterial prod-
ucts that activate TLRs. Furthermore, Lip-C6 functions by
inhibiting CXC chemokine production by corneal epithelial
cells, and thereby blocking neutrophil recruitment to the
cornwl stroma without inhibiting epithelial cell proliferation
and wound healing, Taken together with the absence of
apoptotic side effects, this provides a therapeutic application
for ameliorating the clinical manifestations associated with
microbial keratitis.

[0027] In certain aspects, the application provides com-
positions comprising a ceramide or ceramide derivative and
an excipient. Such compositions may be designed for deliv-
ery systemically or locally, and may be formulated for
administration in any convenient way for use in human or

or ceramide derivative composition is formulated for local
delivery to a particular epithelium, optionally a mueosal
epithelium, For example, a composition may be formulated
for delivery to the mouth, the eye, the skin, the vagina, the
rectum, the intestines and the nose or other airways, In
certain embodiments, the application provides methods for
making a medicament comprising a ceramide or ceramide
derivative and an excipient for the administration by one of
the above-described modes,

[0028] Thus, another aspect of the present invention pro-
vides compositions, optionally pharrnaceutically acceptable
compositions, comprising an amount, optionally a therapeu-
tically effective amount, of ceramide, formulated together
with one or more excipients, including additives and/0r
diluents. As described in detail below, the compositions may

form, including those adapted for the following: (1) sys-
temic or local oral administration, for example, drenches
(aqueous or non-aqueous solutions or suspensions), tablets,
boluses, powders, granules, pastes, or ﬁlms; (2) parenteral
administration, for example, by subcutaneous, intramuscular
or intravenous injection as, for example, a sterile solution or
suspension; (3) topical application, for example, as a cream,
ointment or spray applied to the skin; or (4) intravaginally or
intrarectally, for example, as a pessary, cream or foam. In
certain embodiments the subject ceramide compounds may
be incorporated into liposomal vesicles,

[0029] The phrase “therapeutically-etfective amount” as
used herein means that amount of a compound, material, or
composition comprising a compound of the present inven-
tion that is effective for producing some desired therapeutic
effect by blocking neutrophil inﬁltration to the site of injury.

[0030] The phrase “pharmaceutically acceptable” is

optionally phannaceutically-acceptable, involved in admin-
istering the subject cerarnidei Each excipient should be
compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and
not injurious to the subject. Some examples of materials

Mouse Model of Keratitis

[0064] C57BL/6 mice (6-8 weeks old) from The Jackson
Laboratory (Bar Harbor, Me) were anesthetized by intrap-
eritoneal injection of 04 ml 2,2,2-tribromoethanol (TBE),
and a 1 mm diameter area of the central corneal epithelium
was deﬁned using a trephine, and epithelium was removed
using an AlgerbrushTM (Richmond Products, Albuquerque,
N. Mex.) Comeas were then treated with ultrapure lipopo-
lysaccharide (LPS) from Invivogen, San Diego, Calif.) as
described in References l and 2, or with S aureus strain
8325 that had been killed by exposure to ultraviolet radiation

In Vivo Confocal Microscopy Analysis of Corneal
Thickness and Haze

[0066] In Vivo analysis of cellular inﬁltration was accom-
plished using a Nidek ConfoscanTM as described in Refer-
ence 1. Brieﬂy, mice were anesthetized and immobilized,
and the cornea was examined using a 40x objective with a
transparent gel (Genteal, Novartis Ophthalmics, Duluth,
Ga.) as a medium, A series of images of the entire cornea
was captured using NAVISTM software, and stromal thick-
ness (area between basal epithelium and corneal endothe-
lium) was measured directly using the NavisTM soﬂware, To
measure stromal haze, the light intensity of each 1-2 pm
image of the corneal stroma was exported into Prism (Graph
Pad Software, San Diego, Calif), and the total area under the
curve was then calculated as described in References 1 and
8.

In Vitro Neutrophil Activation

[0068] The human HL-60 cell line was maintained in
RPMI with 10% FBS, and incubated ﬁve days in 12%
DMSO to generate the neutrophil phenotype (Ref. 9). Cells
were placed into 96 well plates at 1><105 per well, and
incubated 6 hrs with S. aureus or LPS. CXCL8/IL-8 pro-
duction was measured by ELISA (R&D Systems, Minne-
apolis, Minn.)

[0069] Murine peritoneal neutrophils were obtained as
described in Reference 8. Brieﬂy, mice were injected with 1
ml of 9% casein 16 hrs and 3 hrs prior to peritoneal lavage,
and cells were layered onto a sterile 90% Percoll gradient
(Pharmacia, Biotech, Piscataway, N.J.). The neutrophil
population (>95%) was recovered from the second layer on
the gradient as determined by cytology. Neutrophils were
incubated in DMEM for 2 hrs at 37° C. with 50 ng/ml
GM-CSF, and stimulated for 15 hrs with S aureus or LPS.
Viability was >95% as determined by Trypan blue exclusion
Cytokines in the culture supematants were measured by
ELISA (R&D Systems).

Lip-C6 Inhibition of TLR Activation of HCE Cells

[0070] To determine the effect of Lip-C6 on TLR-induced
CXC chemokine production, human corneal epithelial
(HCE) cells were brieﬂy exposed (30 min) to Lip-C6 or
control/ghost (non-C6) liposomes, washed, and incubated
with inactivated S. aureus, which activates TLR2 in addition
to a speciﬁc synthetic TLR2 ligand, ParnsCys. As a further
control, we used Lip-sphingosine-l-P (SlP), a ceramide
metabolite linked to mitogenesis. As shown in FIG. 1A,
CXCLl, CXCLS and CXCL8 was produced in response to
stimulation with S. aureus. Control (ghost) lipo somes had no
effect on constitutive or stimulated chemokine production;
however. exposure to Lip-C6 completely inhibited S
aureus-induced and PamsCys-induced CXCLl, CXCLS and
CXCL8 production. In contrast, SlP did not reduce
chemokine production, and in the case of CXCL8/IL-8, SlP
actually augmented chemokine production by S1 aureusl To
ascertain the effect of Lip-C6 on TLR2-stimulated primary
epithelial cells, human corneal epithelial cells were isolated
from donor corneas and incubated with Pam3Cys in the
presence of Lip-C6 or ghost liposomes. As shown in FIG.
1B, Lip-C6, but not control, ghost liposomes inhibited
production of CXCL1, CXCLS and CXCL8 by primary
human corneal epithelial cells,

[0071] To determine the inhibitory effect of Lip-C6 over a
12 hr period of TLR2 stimulation, HCE cells were pre-
incubated with Lip-C6 or control, ghost liposomes prior to
addition of S aureus. Cell supernatants were collected at 3
hrs, 6 hrs and 12 hrs, and chemokine production was
measured by ELISA, As shown in FIG. 2, cytokine produc-
tion by Lip-C6 treated cells was signiﬁcantly lower than
control cells as early as 3 hrs, and continued until 12 hrs after
St aureus stimulation. Taken together, these data clearly
demonstrate that Lip-C6 inhibits TLR2-induced CXC
chemokine production by human corneal epithelial cells in
a dose and time-dependent manner,
US 2019/0029978 A1

Example 1 3

Localization of Lip-C6

[0072] To identify the cellular localization of Lip-C6,
liposomes were prepared using C6-NBD, and were incu-
bated with HCE cells and counter-stained with either
BodipyTM-labeled ceramide as a Golgi marker (InVitrogen)
or with Mito-Tracker red. As shown in FIG. 3, Lip-C6-NBD
co-localized with ceramide (a-c), but not with mitochondria
(d), demonstrating that the lipid formulation of C6 localizes
to the same site as soluble ceramide.

Example 14

Apoptosis Detection

[0073] To determine if Lip-C6-mediated inhibition of
CXC chemokines was due to induction of a pro-apoptotic
response, HCE cells were incubated with S. aureus and
either Lip-C6 or ghost liposomes for 18 hrs, and apoptosis
was measured by TUNEL assay. As shown in FIG. 4A,B,
fewer than 2% TUNEL positive cells were detected in any
of the groups, including Lip-C6-treated cells, whereas 100%
cells were TUNEL positive after DNAse treatment This
ﬁnding indicates that Lip-C6 inhibits CXC chemokine pro-
duction without inducing apoptosis.

Example 1 5

Inhibition of p38 and JNK Phosphorylation

[0074] To examine the effect of Lip-C6 on p38 and JNK,
HCE cells were incubated with 5 [1M Lip-C6 or ghost
liposomes for 30 min., and S. aureus was added for an
additional 6 hrs. HCE cells were then processed for SDS-
PAGE and Western Blot analysis using Ab to total and
phosphorylated JNK and p38.

[0075] As shown in FIG. 5, JNK and p38 were phospho-
rylated after stimulation with S aureus. Furthermore, phos-
phorylation was blocked by Lip-C6 but not by control
(ghost) liposomes. As p38 and JNK are involved in inﬂam-
matory processes, including CXC chemokine production,
these ﬁndings indicate that the anti-inﬂammatory eﬁect of
C6 is, in part, due to inhibition of p38 and JNK phospho-
rylation.

Example 16

Neutrophil Recruitment Inhibition

[007 6] The eﬁect of Lip-C6 in vivo was examined to
determine if Lip-C6 inhibits LPS- or S. aureus-induced
corneal inﬂammation. 2 nMole (811 ng) of either Lip-C6 or
control liposomes in 2 pl was either: i) injected into the
sub-conjunctiva] space; ii) applied topically after inducing a
1 mm diameter corneal abrasion; or iii) applied using both
modalities. Aﬁer 30 min, abraded comeas were treated with
either the TLR2 agonist S aureus or the TLR4 agonist LPS,
Mice were sacriﬁced 18 hrs later, and neutrophil recruitment
to the corneal stroma was determined by immmunohisto-
chemistry using NIMP-R14, and the number of neutrophils
per 5 pm section was examined by direct counting.

[0077] As shown in FIG 6, S. aureus or LPS applied to the
abraded corneal surface induced a pronounced neutrophil
inﬁltration to the cornea] stroma within 24 hrs. However, we
found that Lip-C6 administered by sub-conjunctiva] injec-

Jan. 31, 2019

tion, topical application, or both treatments signiﬁcantly
inhibited neutrophil recruitment to the corneal stroma. Fur-
thermore, we found that there was no diﬂerence in inhibitory
activity between these modalities.

Example 17

Eﬁect of Topical Lip-C6 on Corneal Thickness and Haze

[0078] To assess the eﬁect of topical Lip-C6 on TLR2-
induced corneal thickness and haze, corneas were abraded as
before, control or Lip-C6 was added one hour before and 6
hrs after stimulation with 1x107 UV inactivated S aureus or
40 pg LPS, After 24 hrs, comeas were examined by in vivo
confocal microscopy (Confoscanm), and increases in cor-
neal thickness and haze were measured using NavisTM
software as described in Refs. 1 and 8. Neutrophils were
detected by immunohistochemistry as before. FIG. 7 shows
that Lip-C6 administered topically not only inhibited neu-
trophil recruitment to the corneal stroma, but also prevented
development of increased corneal thickness and haze
induced by S aureus or LPS,

Example 18

[0079] Lip-C6 does not Prevent Corneal Epithelial Wound
Healing

[0080] As corneal wound healing requires epithelial cell
proliferation and migration, the effect of Lip-C6 in this
process was examined. A one mm diameter wound was
made in the corneal epithelial layer as described above, and
corneas were pre-treated for 30 min with Lip-C6 or ghost
liposomes, and exposed to S. aureus. Fluorescein was added
to the corneal surface at 0 hr, 6 hrs and 24 hrs after abrasion.
As ﬁuorescein binds only to sites where the corneal epithe-
lium is not intact or contiguous, the area of ﬂuorescein
binding shows the area of the wound, and conversely
ﬂuorescein exclusion indicates wound healing. As shown in
FIG. 8A, ﬂuorescein was present on the wound at 0 hr and
6 hrs in control (ghost) and Lip-C6 treated corneas exposed
to S aureus. Fluorescein was undetectable alter 24 hrs,
indicating complete wound healing The rate of corneal
wound healing was not inhibited by Lip-C6 or control
liposomes in the presence of S aureus (FIG. 8B). Similarly,
H&E stained sections of representative corneas treated with
Lip-C6 show that the corneal epithelium is absent at 6 hrs,
and has regenerated aﬁer 24 hrs (FIG 8C), Similar results
were observed in all control groups (data not shown),
thereby demonstrating that the anti-inﬂammatory activity of
C6-ceramide is not due to impaired corneal wound healing.

[0081] To determine if Lip-C6 induces corneal epithelial
cell apoptosis, corneal sections were stained for TUNEL
reactivity and counterstained with DAPI. FIG. 8D shows
that TUNEL positive cells were not detected in the stroma or
epithelium of either na'i've corneas (a) or corneas treated with
Lip-C6 and S. aureus (b), TUNEL positive corneal epithelial
cells were not detected in any of the experimental groups
(not shown), thereby demonstrating that Lip-C6 has no
pro-apoptotic eﬁect on epithelial cells in vivo.

[0082] These observations support the conclusion that
Lip—C6 suppresses corneal inﬂammation by inhibiting CXC
chemokine production and resultant neutrophil recruitment
to the corneal stroma rather than promoting epithelial cell
apoptosis.

large therapeutic induces are preferred. While compounds
that exhibit toxic side etfects may be used, care should be
taken to design a delivery system that targets such com-
pounds to the site of affected tissue in order to minimize
potential damage to uninfected cells and, thereby, reduce
side effects.

[0055] The data obtained from the cell culture assays and
animal studies can be used in formulating a range of dosage
for use in humans The dosage of such compounds lies
preferably within a range of circulating concentrations that
include the ED50 with little or no toxicity. The dosage may
vary within this range depending upon the dosage form
employed and the route of administration utilizedi For any
compound used in the method of the invention, the thera-
peutically effective dose can be estimated initially from cell
culture assays A dose may be formulated in animal models
to achieve a circulating plasma concentration range that
includes the IC50 (ie, the concentration of the test com-
pound which achieves a half-maximal inhibition of symp-
toms) as determined in cell culture Such information can be
used to more accurately determine useful doses in humans
Levels in plasma may be measured, for example, by high

[0058] Liposomes were prepared as described previously
(see for example, Stover et al, 2003; and Stover et al., 2005)
containing 30 molar % C6-ceramide, l,2-disteoroyl-sn-
glycer0-3-ph0sphocholine, 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phos-
phoethanolamine, l,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3—ph0sphoetha-
nol-amine-N-[methoxy PEG(2000)], PEG(750)—C6-
ceramide, Control liposomes were made up Without
ceramide, but contained the same amount of total lipids
Brieﬂy, lipids were solubilized in chloroform, dried under a
stream of nitrogen and hydrated with a phosphate-buffered
saline solution at 55° C. The resulting solution was soni-
cated, and underwent extrusion through 100 nm polycar-
bonate membranes using the Avanti Mini Extruder (Avanti
Polar Lipids). Liposomal-C6 vesicles had an average
homogenous size distribution of 80:15 nm as measured by
dynamic light scattering. Liposome C6 and control, ghost
liposomes were maintained at 4° C

SDS-PAGE and Western Blot Analysis

[0063] For immunoblot analysis, equivalent amounts of
protein were electrophoresed on denaturing and reducing
8% polyacrylamide gels and transferred to nitrocellulose
membrane. The membrane was blocked by 5% nonfat dry
milk and then incubated with antibody speciﬁc for phospho-
JNK (#9251), phospho—p38MAPK (#9216) INK (#9252),
and p38 MAPK (#9212 (Cell Signaling Technology, Bev-
erly, Mass). Antibody speciﬁc for actin was purchased from
Sigma-Aldrich and used for immunoblot detection at a
dilution of 1:3000. Peroxidase conjugated goat anti-mouse
IgG (SC-2005) and goat anti-rabbit IgG (SC-2004) were
obtained from Santa Cruz Biotechnology and used at dilu-
tion of 1:5000. Secondary antibody binding was visualized
using a commercial chemiluminescence detection kit (Arn-
ersliam Bioscience). The intensity of the bands in X-ray ﬁlm
were quantiﬁed by “lmageJ” software, and calculated as
ratio of P-p38 and P-JNK over total p38 and INK. Error bars
are mean of two separated experiments with similar results.

tract, optionally, in a delayed manner. Examples of embed-
ding compositions that can be used include polymeric sub-
stances and waxes. The active ingredient can also be in
microencapsulated form, if appropriate, with one or more of
the above-described excipients,

[0042] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration of the
compounds of the invention include phamiaceutically
acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspen-
sions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active ingredient,
the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents com-
monly used in the art, such as, for example, water or other
solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsiﬁers, such as ethyl
alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate,
benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-
butylene glycol, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut,
corn, germ, olive, castor and sesame oils), glycerol, tetra-
hydrofuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid
esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.

[0043] Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can
also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying
and suspending agents, sweetening, ﬂavoring, coloring, per-
fuming and preservative agents.

[0044] Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds,
may contain suspending agents as, for example, ethoxylated
isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan
esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide,
bentonite, agar-agar and tragacanth, and mixtures thereof

[0045] Formulations of the pharmaceutical compositions
of the invention for rectal or vaginal administration may be
presented as a suppository, which may be prepared by
mixing one or more compounds of the invention with one or
more suitable nonirritating excipients or carriers comprising,
for example, cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol, a supposi-
tory wax or a salicylate, and which is solid at room tem-
perature, but liquid at body temperature and, therefore, will
melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the cer-
amide.

[0046] Dosage forms for the topical or transdermal (sys-
temic) or dermal (local) administration of a compound of
this invention include powders, sprays, ointments, pastes,
creams. lotions, gels, solutions, patches and inhalants. The
active compound may be mixed under sterile conditions
with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and with any
preservatives, buffers, or propellants that may be required. In
one embodiment, the ceramide or ceramide derivative is
administered at a dosage of about 1 nanogram to about 100
micrograms per day. In another embodiment, the ceramide
or ceramide derivative is administered at a dosage of about
100 nanograms to about 1 microgram per day,

[0047] Ophthalmic formulations, eye drops, creams, oint-
ments, powders, solutions and the like, are also contem-
plated as being within the scope of this invention.

[0048] The ointments, pastes, creams and gels may con-
tain, in addition to an active compound of this invention,
excipients, such as animal and vegetable fats, oils, waxes,
paraﬁins, starch, tragacanth, cellulose derivatives, polyeth-
ylene glycols, silicones, bentonites, silicic acid, talc and zinc
oxide, or mixtures thereof.

[0049] Powders and sprays can contain, in addition to a
compound of this invention, excipients such as lactose, talc,
silicic acid, aluminum hydroxide, calcium silicates and
polyamide powder, or mixtures of these substances. Sprays
can additionally contain customary propellants, such as

chloroﬂuorohydrocarbons and volatile unsubstituted hydro-
carbons, such as butane and propane.

[0050] In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a
drug, it is desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from
subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be
accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline
or amorphous material having poor water solubility, The rate
of absorption of the drug then depends upon its rate of
dissolution that turn, may depend upon crystal size and
crystalline form Alternatively, delayed absorption of a par-
enterally administered drug form is accomplished by dis-
solving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.

[0051] Injectable depot forms are made by forming micro-
encapsule matrices of the subject compounds in biodegrad-
able polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending
on the ratio of drug to polymer, and the nature of the
particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be
controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers
include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot
injectable formulations are also prepared by entrapping the
drug in liposomes or microemulsions that are compatible
with body tissue.

[0052] When the compounds of the present invention are
administered as pharmaceuticals, to humans and animals,
they can be given per se or as a pharmaceutical composition
containing, for example, 0.1 to 99.5% (more preferably, 05
to 90%) of active ingredient in combination with a pharma-
ceutically acceptable carrier.

[0053] In yet another embodiment, the ceramide can be
administered as part of a combinatorial therapy with other
agents. For example. the combinatorial therapy can include
a ceramide with at least one antibacterial, antiviral or
antifungal agent, In one embodiment, the combinational
therapy includes a ceramide and at least one opthalmic
antibiotic or opthalmic antivirali Opthalmic antibiotics
include, e.g., Chloromycetin opthalmic (chloramphenical);
Cortisporin (neomycin and polymyxin l3 sulfates and
hydrocortisone acetate cream); Ilotycin (erythromycin
opthalmic ointment); NeoDecadron (neomycin sulfate-dex-
amethasone socium phosphate); Polytrim (trimethoprim and
polythyxin [3 sulfate opthalmic solution); Terra-Cortril
(oxytetracycline HCl and hydrocorlisone acetate); Terramy-
cin (oxytetracycline); and TobraDex (tobramycin and dex-
amethasone opt ialmic suspension and ointment). Opthalmic
antivirals include, e,g., Vira-A opthalmic ointment, (vidara-
bine)i Opthalmic quinalones include, e.g., Chibroxin (nor-
ﬂoxacin opthalmic solution); Ciloxan opthalmic solution,
(Ciproﬂoxacin iCl); Ciloxan opthalmic ointment, (Cipro-
ﬂoxacin HCl); and Ocuﬂox opthalmic solution (oﬂoxacin).
Opthalmic sulfonamides include, e.g,, Blephamide opthal-
mic ointment (sulfacetamide sodium and prednisolone
acetate); and B ephamide opthalmic suspension (sulfacet-
amide sodium and prednisolone acetate) A combinatorial
therapy may inc ude a C6-ceramide and a chemotherapeutic
agent, such as cytosine, arabinoside, S-ﬂuorouracil,
hydroxyurea, and methotrexate.

[0054] Toxicity and therapeutic eﬁicacy of such com-
pounds can be cetermined by standard pharmaceutical pro-
cedures in cell cultures or experimental animals, e.g., for
determining The Ld50 (The Dose Lethal To 50% Of The
Population) And The Ed50 (the dose therapeutically effec-
tive in 50% of the population) The dose ratio between toxic
and therapeutic effects is the therapeutic index and it can be
expressed as the ratio LDSO/EDSO. Compounds that exhibit

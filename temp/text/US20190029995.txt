TECHNICAL FIELD

[0002] This patent document relates to compositions,
devices, and methods for preventing and/or relieving side
eﬂects of alcohol consumption,

BACKGROUND

[0003] Alcohol is a constituent of medicines, foods, and
beverages that provides both beneﬁcial and detrimental
eﬂects on human beings. Alcohol typically refers to ethyl
alcohol (ethanol), which is the common form of consumable
alcohol found in alcoholic beverages, e.g., such as beer,
wine, and liquor, Consumable alcohol is produced by fer-
mentation processes ofvarious food products, eg, including
wheat, rice, or other starches, fruits, honey, or other sources
of sugars, and yeast. The National Institute of Alcohol Abuse
and Alcoholism (NIAAA) of the US. National Institutes of
Health (NIH) considers a standard drink to be equal to 0.6
ounces of pure ethanol, e,g., which is equivalent to approxi-
mately 12 ﬂuid ounces (ﬂ, 02,) of regular beer (of about 5%
alcohol), 8-9 ﬂ, oz. of malt liquor (of about 7% alcohol), 5
ﬂ, oz, of wine (of about 12% alcohol), and 1.5 ﬂ. oz,
(referred to as a “‘shot”) of an 80-proof distilled spirit or
liquor (e.g., gin, rum, vodka, whiskey, tequila, etc.).
[0004] During consumption, alcohol is rapidly absorbed
from the stomach and small intestine into the bloodstream,
from which it can affect several organs including the brain,
heart, pancreas, and liver. Alcohol can act as a depressant to
the central nervous system (CNS), For example, alcohol
interferes with the brain’s communication pathways, which
affects brain functionality that manifests in cognitive and
behavioral changes, e,g,, such as a person’s ability to think,
focus, move, as well as his/her mood and behavior, Alcohol
can cause inﬂammation and damage to the liver, e.g,, where
consistent heavy drinking can cause chronic liver problems,
For example, heavy drinking can lead to steatosis (e.g., or
fatty liver), infection (e,g., alcoholic hepatitis), ﬁbrosis, and
cirrhosis,

SUMMARY

[0005] Disclosed are compositions, devices, and methods
to prevent and recover from detrimental eﬂects of alcohol
consumption

[0006] In one aspect, a composition includes dihydro-
myricetin (DHM), and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC). Implemen-
tations of the composition can include one or more of the
following features. In some implementations, for example,

Jan. 31, 2019

the composition can further include prickly pear extract
and/or silymarin. In some implementations, for example, the
composition can further include ginger root extract, vitamin
C, vitamin E, electrolytes, or one, a blend or a complex of
B vitamins (e.g., thiamine, riboﬂavin, niacin, pantothenic
acid, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, biotin, folic acid, and cobala-
min), In some implementations, for example, the composi-
tion can further include carbohydrates, e.g, including a
sugar,

[0007] In one aspect, a composition for mitigating adverse
effects of alcohol consumption includes dihydromyricetin
(DHM) to reduce hangover symptoms including one or more
of sleep disruption, headache, or alcohol withdrawal eifects
associated alcohol consumption; and N-acetyl cysteine
(NAC) to aﬂect acetaldehyde and congeners produced by
the liver associated with the alcohol consumption. Imple-
mentations of the composition can include one or more of
the following features, In some implementations, for
example, the composition can further include prickly pear
extract provided to aﬂect oxidative stress associated with the
alcohol consumption; silymarin provided to affect liver
functionality in breaking down toxic substances and to affect
oxidative stress associated the alcohol consumption; and/or
one or more B vitamins selected from a group consisting of
thiamine, riboﬂavin, niacin, pantothenic acid, pyridoxine,
pyridoxal, biotin, folic acid, and cobalamin, in which the one
or more B vitamins are provided to replenish vitamins lost
and to reduce headaches associated the alcohol consump-
tion,

[0008] In one aspect, a method for mitigating adverse
etfects of alcohol consumption includes providing a dose of
a ﬁrst-stage composition to be consumed at a first time
proximate to the beginning of alcohol consumption by a
person, in which the ﬁrst-stage composition includes
N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) and one or both of prickly pear
extract and silymarin; and providing a dose of a second-
stage composition to be consumed at a second time proxi-
mate to the end of the alcohol consumption by the person,
or providing a dose of the second-stage composition or a
third-stage composition to be consumed at a third time after
the alcohol consumption by the user, in which the second-
stage composition and the third-stage composition include
dihydromyricetin (DHM), NAC, and one or both of one or
both of prickly pear extract and silymarin.

[0009] The subject matter described in this patent docu-
ment can be implemented in speciﬁc ways that provide one
or more of the following features, For example, the dis-
closed compositions include formulations of ingredients
capable of eﬁectively and comprehensively treating multiple
symptoms of hangovers and the negative effects of alcohol.
In some implementations, for example, compositions of the
present technology can be used to aid in sobering up a
person if taken during drinking, or keeping them sober if
taken before drinking, In some implementations, for
example, compositions of the present technology can be
used as a daily supplement to aid in the replenishing of
electrolytes ofthe individual, and/or reverse negative eﬁects
on brain function (e.g., through the use of DHM).

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS

the causes for a hangover. Existing hangover cures provide
noncomprehensive or incomplete solutions that fail to iden-
tify or affect the full spectrum of causes and fail to provide
comprehensive anti-hangover agent. Accordingly, the nega-
tive consequences of alcohol consumption continue to
impair alcohol consumers globally, e.g., which have been
shown to effect health and economies. The disclosed tech-
nology provides various compositions, formulations, deliv-
ery systems (e.g., capsules, powders, liquids) and methods
for comprehensively treating and/or preventing hangovers,
which target the full spectrum of hangover causes and
provide more eifective relief to persons consuming alcohol
that can reduce at least some of the negative effects of
alcohol.

Exemplary Embodiments

[0022] Various exemplary embodiments of the disclosed
technology are illustrated in the following description and
examples. In one embodiment, for example, a hangover
prevention and/or treatment composition of the present
technology includes dihydromyricetin (DHM), and n-acetyl
cysteine (NAC). DHM is a compound also referred to as
ampelopsin ((2R,3R)—3,5,7-trihydroxy-2-(3,4,5-trihydroxy-
phenyl)-2,3-dihydrochromen-4-one), which, for example,
can be found in vine tea extract. DHM is understood to
increase the rate at which alcohol and acetaldehyde are
removed by the liver, and to reduce at least some of the
negative etfects of alcohol on the brain. DHM binds to the
same receptors in the nervous system as alcohol binds to,
e.g., GABAA1 receptor By binding to the same receptor,
DHM creates trafﬁc at that receptor and thereby reduces
alcohol’s etfects when taken with alcohol in the system,
which can contribute to reducing AW symptoms. In some
implementations of the exemplary hangover prevention and/
or treatment composition, for example, the DHM (e.g., or
extract of the plant from which it comes from, ampelopsin)
is provided by the composition to combat the disruption of
sleep and other biological rhythms, headaches, and the
effects of alcohol withdrawal, i.e., the fourth, ﬁfth, and sixth
physiological factors listed above contributing to hangovers.
For example, the DHM can also be provided by the com-
position to promote liver functionality in breaking down
toxic substances, i.e., the ninth physiological factor contrib-
uting to hangovers. NAC is a natural precursor to L-Gluta-
thione, which is an enzyme in the liver that breaks down
acetaldehyde. In some implementations, for example, the
NAC (e.g., or any of its functional substitutes such as
SAM-e or L—Glutathione, or other) is provided by the
composition to combat the toxic effects of acetaldehyde and
congeners, i.e., the seventh physiological factor listed above
contributing to hangovers.

[0023] In some implementations of the composition, for
example, the DHM can be included in an amount of at least
300 mg. In some implementations of the composition, for
example, the amount of DHM can be in a range between 300
mg and 3600 mg. In some implementations of the compo-
sition, for example, the NAC can be included in an amount
of at least 25 mg. In some implementations of the compo-
sition, for example, the amount of NAC can be in a range
between 25 mg and 1200 mg In some implementations of
the exemplary hangover prevention and/or treatment com-
position, for example, the amount of the DHM can be

Jan. 31, 2019

between 70 wt. % to 80 wt. % (e.g., 75 wt. %) and the
amount of the NAC can be between 20 wt. % to 30 wt. %
(e.g., 25 wt. %).

[0024] The composition can be incorporated into any of a
variety of delivery systems, eg, such as a capsule. In an
example of a capsule (e.g., gelatin capsule) containing a 400
mg dose of the exemplary composition, the capsule can
contain 300 mg of the DHM and 100 mg of the NAC. In
another example of a capsule containing a 800 mg dose of
the exemplary composition, the capsule can contain 600 mg
of the DHM and 200 mg of the NAC. For example, the
gelatin capsule can contain non-active ingredients adding to
the mass of the composition’s delivery system while not
affecting the functionality of the composition. In some
examples, a single 00 size gelatin capsule can include
non-active ingredients including gelatin, microcrystalline,
cellulose, magnesium stearate, and food coloring to make
capsule colors. In some implementations of the exemplary
hangover prevention and/or treatment composition, for
example, two 00 size gelatin capsules each containing 600
mg of the DHM and 200 mg of the NAC may constitute a
single dose of the composition.

[0025] In some embodiments of the composition, for
example, the composition can further include Prickly Pear
Extract and/or an extract of its active ingredient(s) (e.g.,
Tex-OE® or any other of its functional substitutes such as
antioxidant constituents including Gogi Berries, Kudzu
Flower, or artichoke and/or the extracts of their active
ingredients) Tex-OE® is a constituent of the prickly pear
cactus capable of protecting cells from acetaldehyde, lactic
acid, and toxins. For example, the Prickly Pear Extract can
be provided by the composition to combat oxidative stress
(e.g., toxic etTects of acetaldehyde and congeners) that can
cause inﬂammation, i.e., the seventh physiological factor
listed above contributing to hangovers. In some implemen-
tations of the composition, for example, the Prickly Pear
Extract can be included in an amount of at least 50 mg. In
some implementations of the composition, for example, the
amount of Prickly Pear Extract can be in a range between 50
mg and 1500 mg. In some implementations of an exemplary
composition including DHM, NAC, and Prickly Pear
Extract, for example, the amount of the DHM can be
between 60 wt. % to 70 wt. % (e.g., 66.67 wt. %), the
amount of the NAC can be between 15 wt. % to 30 wt. %
(e.g., 22.2 wt. %), and the amount of Prickly Pear Extract
can be between 5 wt. % to 20 wt. % (e.g., 11.1 wt. %). In
an example of a capsule containing a 450 mg dose of the
exemplary composition, the capsule can contain 300 mg of
the DHM, 100 mg of the NAC, and 50 mg of the Prickly
Pear Extract.

[0026] In some embodiments of the composition, for
example, the composition can further include Milk Thistle
and/or an extract of its active ingredient(s) (erg, Silymarin,
or any other of its functional substitutes) In some examples,
the composition includes silibinin (INN) as the active ingre-
dient of the silymarin constituent of the Milk Thistle. For
example, the Milk Thistle can be provided by the compo-
sition to promote liver functionality in breaking down toxic
substances and to combat oxidative stress (e.g., toxic elfects
of acetaldehyde and congeners), ie, the seventh and ninth
physiological factors listed above contributing to hangovers.
In some implementations of the composition, for example,
the Milk Thistle (e.g., Silymarin) can be included in an
amount of at least 100 mg. In some implementations of the
US 2019/0029995 A1

[0011] FIGS. 2A-2C show data plots of analyzed quanti-
tative results obtained from the exemplary studies.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[0012] The ingestion of alcohol has numerous effects on
the human brain and body. The innnediate eﬁect of alcohol
on humans is that of intoxication. This varies in degrees
based on the tolerance of the individual and the amount of
drinks consumed, as well as with the amount of different
types of food and liquids consumed prior to drinking
[0013] The alcohol is transmitted throughout the body via
the blood stream and is progressively cleared from the blood
primarily via the liver. Once alcohol has been cleared from
the blood stream, individuals often experience what is
commonly known as an “alcohol hangover,” e.g., often
simply referred to as a “hangover." A hangover refers to an
array of physical symptoms that alfect a person shortly after
ingesting alcohol, e.g., within hours of consumption. The
symptoms of a hangover include, for example, one or more
of thirst, fatigue and/or weakness, headache and/or muscle
aches, dizziness/faintness, loss of appetite, poor and/or
decreased sleep, nausea and/or stomach pain (e.g., which
can include vomiting), and elevated heart rate. A hangover
is considered to be one of the most widely experienced
negative consequences of consuming ethanol.

[0014] The hangover effect of alcohol consumption can
vary based on the individual (e.g., body mass, age, hydration
level, etc), amount of alcohol ingested, and other ingredi-
ents, foods, or liquids consumed before, during, or after
alcohol consumption. Despite the variability of parameters
that aﬂect the degree to which the symptoms of a hangover
are ‘felt’ by an individual, the hangover effect occurs in an
individual even if he or she does not have signiﬁcant visible
hangover symptoms, as the body has undergone the negative
physical eﬂ'ects of alcohol even if the user is not consciously
aware of it.

[0015] The present technology addresses problems caused
by alcohol consumption including signiﬁcant visible symp-
toms of a hangover consciously felt by the alcohol con-
sumer, and also physical effects of the alcohol on the body
that may not be consciously experienced. Disclosed are
compositions, devices, and methods to prevent and recover
from detrimental eifects of alcohol consumption.

[0016] Usually alcohol is consumed through “alcoholic
beverages.” Alcoholic beverages are drinks that contain the
molecule ethanol. Ethanol is the primary psychoactive
ingredient in alcoholic beverages, e.g., including wine, beer,
and distilled spirits. In the United States, for example,
according to the NIAAA approximately 86% of Americans
18 or older reported that they have consumed alcoholic
beverages at some point in their lifetime, with over 50%
reporting that they have drank in the past month. Owing to
the popularity of alcoholic beverages, alcohol can be con-
sidered as one of the most popular dnrgs in the world.
According to the US Beverage Alcohol Forum, for 2012, the
US. market size of alcoholic beverages was $197.8 billion
in retail sales dollars.

[0017] Because a hangover can result in physically detri-
mental symptoms such lethargy, headaches and nausea, or
other, it oﬁen reduces a person’s ability to work at their
normal or desired state. For example, a study of college
students found that 25% had experienced a hangover in the
previous week, and 29% reported losing school time for
hangover recovery (e.g., Wiese et. al, Annals of Internal

Jan. 3], 2019

Medicine 132 (11): 897-902, June 2000). In the same article,
it was observed that 15% of men and women who have
consumed alcohol experience hangovers at least monthly
and ten percent of British men reported hangover-related
problems at work at least monthly, Hangovers of individuals
that consume alcohol at times proximate to their work
schedule can cause economic losses. For example, it was
estimated that 9.23% (e.g., 11.6 million workers) ofthe US.
labor force work with a hangover and that alcohol use
accounted for 3.3 billion (U .83.) in lost wages each year, as
a result of work missed because of a hangover suffered by
the employee (e.g., Ling et al., Current drug abuse reviews
3 (2): 80-7, 2010). Similar results were shown for other
countries such as Canada and Finland. Moreover, even if one
does go to work with noticeable hangover symptoms, it has
been noted that hangover severity and neurocognitive per-
formance are signiﬁcantly correlated, with more intense
hangovers indicating less ﬁtness for duty (e.g., Howland et
al, Ioumal of Addiction Research Therapy (01), January
2010).

[0018] In a study reviewing hangovers, the physiological
factors contributing to a hangover were identiﬁed as (l)
dehydration and electrolyte imbalances, (2) gastrointestinal
disturbances, (3) low blood sugar, (4) disruption of sleep and
other biological rhythms, (5) headaches, (6) effects of alco-
hol withdrawal (AW), e.g., including irritability, anxiety,
etc, and (7) toxic effects of acetaldehyde and congeners
(e.g., Swiﬁ and Davidson. Alcohol Health Res. World, 22:
54-60, 1998). It has been shown by Wiese et al. that
supplementation with B-Vrtamins can decrease the severity
of a hangover, implying that another cause of a hangover can
include (8) vitamin loss, The brain is very B-Vrtamin
dependent, and a lack of nutrition causes physiological
Jroblems.

[0019] Acetaldehyde (CHSCHO, also referred to as etha-
nal) is an aldehyde that is found in nature and also produced
y the partial oxidation of ethanol in the liver by an enzyme
alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH). Acetaldehyde is considered
to be a contributing constituent that causes hangovers from
alcohol consumption.

[0020] The liver acts to clear alcohol and acetaldehyde
rom the body. Alcohol consumption (and particularly over
consumption) leads to liver stress and L—Glutathione deple-
tion, leaving the individual with a temporarily overtaxed
liver that cannot properly clear the body of toxins for a
Jeriod of time during and aﬁer drinking. This over-taxation
of the liver can lead to a buildup of lactic acid which known
to be related to feelings of lethargy, e.g., and is thereby also
considered to be another physiological factor contributing to
Jangovers: (9) reduced or impaired liver function in regards
to added stress of alcohol on regular liver function The
present technology is capable of targeting these nine exem-
Jlary hangover causes in a comprehensive way.

[0021] Despite the increasing number of anti-hangover
technologies available, none of the existing ‘hangover cures’
rovide the alcohol consumer with a composition and/or
methodology that is capable to counter all or at least most of
the known causes of a hangover, and thereby are ineffective
to prevent a potential hangover or to extensively improve the
ability to recover from a multi-faceted (e.g., multi-symp-
tomatic) hangover. Although some existing hangover rem-
edies may be considered to be partially eﬁective, there is still
a need for a comprehensive solution that addresses a greater
number of contributing factors for a hangover, if not all of
US 2019/0029995 A1

composition, for example, the amount of Milk Thistle (e.g.,
Silymarin) can be in a range between 100 mg and 500 mg.
n some implementations of an exemplary composition
including DHM, NAC, and Milk Thistle, for example, the
amount of the DHM can be between 60 wt. % to 70 wt, %
(e.g., 63.1 wt. %), the amount of the NAC can be between
5 wt. % to 30 wt, % (e.g., 211 wt. %), and the amount of
Milk Thistle can be between 5 wt, % to 20 wt. % (eg, 158
wt. %), In an example ofa capsule containing a 475 mg dose
of the exemplary composition, the capsule can contain 300
mg of the DHM, 100 mg of the NAC, and 75 mg of the Milk
"histle. In other implementations of an exemplary compo-
sition including DHM, NAC, Prickly Pear Extract and Milk
Thistle, for example, the amount of the DHM can be
between 50 wt, % to 65 wt. % (e.gi, 57.1 wt. %), the amount
ofthe NAC can be between 15 wt, % to 25 wt. % (e.g., 19.1
wt, %), the amount of Prickly Pear Extract can be between
5 wt, % to 15 wt. % (eg, 95 wt. %), and the amount ofMilk
Thistle can be between 10 wt. % to 20 wt. % (erg, 14.3 wt.
%), In an example ofa capsule conmining a 525 mg dose of
tie exemplary composition, the capsule can contain 300 mg
ofthe DHM, 100 mg ofthe NAC, 50 mg of the Prickly Pear
Extract, and 75 mg of the Milk Thistle,

[0027] In some embodiments of the composition, for
example, the composition can further include Ginger Root
(e.g., including gingerol [(S)-5-hydroxy-l-(4-hydroxy-3-
methoxyphenyl)-3-decanone], and/or (6)-Shogaol [(E)-l-(4-
iydioxy-3-methoxyphenyl)dec-4-en-3 -one], and/ or another
of ginger’s various constituents (which may be basic in pH))
to combat gastrointestinal disturbances, i.e., the second
physiological factor listed above contributing to hangovers.
n some implementations of the composition, for example,
the Ginger Root Extract (e.g., 5% gingerol) can be included
in an amount of at least 25 mg, In some implementations of
the composition, for example, the amount of Ginger Root
Extract can be in a range between 25 mg and 1500 mg.

[0028] In some embodiments of the composition, for
example, the composition can ﬁlrther include Vitamin B
complex (e.g., Vitamins B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and
312, or combinations thereof) to replenish vitamins lost
with drinking alcohol (e.g., vitamins consumed in the alco-
hol breakdown process in the liver) and to combat headaches
associated with a hangover, i.e., the eighth and ﬁfth physi-
ological factor listed above contributing to hangovers. In
some implementations of the composition, for example, the
Vitamin B complex or blend can be included in an amount

weighed on average 752 mg+/—l4 mg,

Exemplary Studies

[0058] Results from exemplary studies using the exem-
plary formulations are described In one example study, 27
participants (e.g., 19 males and 8 females) underwent moni-
tored alcohol consumption events where the participants
drank alcoholic beverages of their choosing to their desired
amount. The participants administered one or more of three
different formulations of the composition (eg, exemplary
formulations l, 2, and 3) after drinking alcohol, e.g., within
two hours of the end of the alcohol consumption, but before
going to sleep, The participants were given the exemplary
formulations randomly so as to get an even number of
participants testing each formulation (eg, 9 per formula-
tion). The participants were also studied under the same
alcohol consumption scenarios without the use of the com-
position, i.e., control group.

[0059] The participants were instructed to ﬁll out a quan-
titative survey shortly aﬁer waking from their sleep aﬁer the
alcohol consumption events In the survey, the participants
answered questions directed to: their demographic and
physical attributes, their drinking session experience, their
activities surrounding their drinking experience, and their
self-evaluation about their symptoms of a hangover on
various levels. Participants quantitatively assessed the level
of their hangover symptoms they felt after drinking alcohol
without the composition and with the exemplary formulation
of the composition.

[0060] For example, participants were asked to provide
tieir gender, age, and weight (eg. demographic and physi-
cal attributes information). For example, participants were
asked to provide typical amounts and types of standard
crinks consumed, and amount of time spent drinking in
general, and the amount, type, and time spent drinking
curing the alcohol consumption events. Also, for example,
tie participants were asked questions regarding what they
c id in the prior 48 hours to the monitored alcohol consump-
tion events, as well as what they did during and after
rinking. Because various activities and chemicals can
increase/decrease the likelihood and severity of hangovers,
such parameters were considered for the quantitative analy-
ses of the exemplary studies. For example, questions asked
about the amount of sleep in 48 hours prior to (and innue-
iately after) the alcohol consumption events, the amount of
alcohol consumed in 48 hours prior to the alcohol consump-
tion events, the amount of caffeine and/ or nicotine consumed
prior to (and immediately after) the alcohol consumption
events, the amount of physical activity prior to (and during)
tie alcohol consumption events, and the level of nutrition
received prior to, during, and alter the alcohol consumption
events. For example, the average age of the participants was
24, the average body weight was 167 lbs, the average
number of alcoholic beverages consumed were 9 standard
(rinks, and the average time drinking during the monitored
alcohol consumption events was 4.1 hrs,

[0061] Hangovers are the culmination a large number of
symptoms, such as: headaches, nausea and stomach pain,
epression, anxiety, initability, lethargy, brain fog, and

n

 

Jan. 31, 2019

mental and physical fatigue. Because of this, the participants
were asked to rank the following symptoms on a scale of
1-10 for each symptom for the control (no composition
taken) and for the experimental (composition taken) alcohol
consumption events, eg, in which 10 being the worst
feeling, and 1 being feeling ﬁne. For example, the symptoms
are listed here with a numeric label for associated ﬁgures:
headaches 201; stomach/nausea 202; general energy/leth-
argy 203; focus/ability to think clearly 204; mental energy/
lethargy 205; physical energy/lethargy 206; general sense of
well-being 207; motivation to perform daily activities 208;
and general feeling about experiencing a hangover overall
209,

[0062] The data from the results from the exemplary
studies were compiled and analyzed, and it was found that
for each of the three exemplary compositions (e.g,, the
exemplary formulations l, 2, or 3) that the participants
experienced a greater than 50% positive change in their
hangover symptoms by using the composition than by not
using the composition. In other words, an average of 50%+
reduction in hangover symptoms were experienced across
all three formulations, with one standard deviation being
less than 27%.

[0063] FIGS. 2A-2C show data plots of analyzed quanti-
tative results obtained from the exemplary studies, FIG. 2A
shows a data plot of the analyzed quantitative results using
the exemplary formulation 1. FIG. 2B shows a data plot of
the analyzed quantitative results using the exemplary for-
mulation 2. FIG. 2C shows a data plot of the analyzed
quantitative results using the exemplary formulation 3. In all
of the data plots in FIGS, 2A-2C, the exemplary data showed
that the average positive changes (between using the exem-
plary composition and not using the composition) were
always at least a 50% reduction in hangover symptoms
across the board. Moreover, the average median percent
change (using the exemplary composition vs. not using the
composition) were 61.1%, 56.7%, and 51.1% for the exem-
plary formulations l, 2, and 3, respectively. Moreover, the
standard deviation from the average mean percent change
was always below 27% (as depicted by the error bars in the
data plots of FIGS. 2A-2B) for all three exemplary compo-
sitions. Therefore, for example, for each of the exemplary
formulations of the disclosed compositions, the composition
was demonstrated to effectively reduce the symptoms of a
hangover across the board,

[0044] FIG. 1 shows a diagram of an exemplary method
100 for mitigating adverse eﬁects of alcohol consumption
using an exemplary multi-staged composition of the dis-
closed technology. The method 100 includes a process 110
to provide a dose of a ﬁrst-stage composition including
NAC, Prickly Pear Extract, and Milk Thistle at a ﬁrst time
proximate to the beginning of alcohol consumption by a user
(i.e., the alcohol consumer). For example, in some imple-
mentations of the process 110, the ﬁrst time can include two
hours or less prior to (e.g., including just before) the
beginning of the alcohol consumption In some implemen-
tations of the process 110, for example, the ﬁrst time can
include within one hour aﬁer the beginning of the alcohol
consumption by the user. In some implementations, for
example, the ﬁrst-stage composition can include the exem-
plary ﬁrst subcombination previously described, In some
implementations of the process 110, for example, the ﬁrst-
stage composition can also include one or more of ginger
root extract, vitamins B complex or blend, vitamin C,
vitamin E, electrolytes, and/or carbohydrates including
sugar. In some implementations of the process 110, for
example, the ﬁrst-stage composition may include the Prickly
Pear Extract or the Milk Thistle. For example, the ﬁrst-stage
composition can be provided by supplying the constituents
of the ﬁrst-stage composition (e,g.. the NAC, and Prickley
Pear Extract and/or Milk Thistle) in a delivery system, e.g.,
including a capsule, tablet, powder, liquid concentrate, or
liquid mixture (e.g., drink).

[0045] The method 100 can include a process 120 to
provide a dose of a second-stage composition including
DHM, NAC, Prickly Pear Extract, and Milk Thistle at a
second time proximate to the end of the alcohol consump-
tion by the user. For example, in some implementations of
the process 120, the second time can include two hours or
less after (e.g., including just aﬁer) the end of the alcohol
consumption. In some implementations of the process 120,
for example, the second time can include within one hour
before the end of the alcohol consumption by the user. In
some implementations, for example, the second-stage com-
position can include the exemplary second subcombination
previously described. In some implementations of the pro-
cess 120, for example, the second-stage composition can
also include one or more of ginger root extract, vitamins B
complex or blend, vitamin C, vitamin E. electrolytes, and/or
carbohydrates including sugar. In some implementations of
the process 120, for example, the second-stage composition
may include the Prickly Pear Extract or the Milk Thistle. For
example, the second-stage composition can be provided by
supplying the constituents of the second-stage composition
(e.g., the DHM, NAC, and Prickley Pear Extract and/or Milk
Thistle) in a delivery system, e.g., including a capsule,
tablet, powder, liquid concentrate, or liquid mixture (e.g.,
drink).

[0046] The method 100 can include a process 130 to
provide a dose of the second-stage composition at a third
time after the alcohol consumption by the user. For example,
in some implementations of the process 130, the third time
can include several hours after (e.g., including four to twelve
hours) the end of the alcohol consumption. For example. the

Jan. 31, 2019

third time can include after the user has slept after the
alcohol consumption. In some implementations of the pro-
cess 130, for example, the second-stage composition pro-
vided in the process 130 can include a third-stage compo-
sition that is provided at the third time that may differ in the
constituents and/or their amounts or relative amounts than
the second-stage composition.

[0047] In some implementations of the method 100, for
example, the ﬁrst-stage and the second-stage compositions
can be provided as two distinctly visible delivery vehicles
and/or packages. For example, the ﬁrst-stage composition
and the second stage composition may be provided as
dilfering colors (e.g., blue pill vs. red pill) in a blister pack
or pill container.

[0048] In some implementations of the method 100, for
example, the method 100 can include the process 110, the
process 120, and the process 130; whereas in some imple-
mentations, for example, the method 100 can include the
process 110 and the process 120; or whereas in some
implementations, for example, the method 100 can include
the process 110 and the process 130.

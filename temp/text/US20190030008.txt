occur also in the arteries to the brain, intestines, kidneys,
legs, etc. Many infarctions involve only very small amounts
of tissue and are termed clinically silent, because the person
having the infarction does not notice the problem, does not
seek medical help or when they do, physicians do not
recognize what has happened

[0157] F. Stent Placement

[0158] In medicine, a stent is an artiﬁcial tube or sleeve
inserted into a natural passagdconduit in the body to pre-
vent, or counteract, a cisease-induced, localized ﬂow con-
striction. The term may also refer to a tube used to tempo-
rarily hold such a natural conduit open to allow access for
surgery. A coronary stent is a tube placed in the coronary
arteries that supply the Jeart, to keep the arteries open in the
treatment of coronary heart disease. It is used in a procedure
called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Stents
reduce chest pain, but tiey have not been shown to improve
survival, except in acute myocardial infarction. Similar
stents and procedures are used in non-coronary vessels, e.g.,
in the legs in peripheral artery disease.

[0159] Treating a blocked (“stenosed”) coronary artery
with a stent follows t e same steps as other angioplasty
procedures with a few important differences. The interven-
tional cardiologist uses angiography to assess the location
and estimate the size 0 the blockage (“lesion”) by injecting
a contrast medium through the guide catheter and viewing
the ﬂow of blood through the downstream coronary arteries.
Intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) may be used to assess the
lesion’s thickness and iardness (“calciﬁcation”). The cardi-
ologist uses this information to decide whether to treat the
lesion with a stent, and if so, what kind and size. Drug
eluting stents are most often sold as a unit, with the stent in
its collapsed form attached onto the outside of a balloon
catheter. Outside the US, physicians may perform “direct
stenting” where the stent is threaded through the lesion and
expanded. Common practice in the US. is to predilate the
blockage before delivering the stent Predilation is accom-
plished by threading the lesion with an ordinary balloon
catheter and expanding it to the vessel’s original diameter
The physician withdraws this catheter and threads the stent
on its balloon catheter through the lesion. The physician
expands the balloon which deforms the metal stent to its
expanded size. The cardiologist may “customize” the ﬁt of
the stent to match the blood vessel’s shape, using IVUS to
guide the work.

 

[0160] Coronary artery stents, typically a metal frame-
work, can be placed inside the artery to help keep it open.
However, as the stent is a foreign object (not native to the
body), it incites an immune response. This may cause scar
tissue (cell proliferation) to rapidly grow over the stent. In
addition, there is a strong tendency for clots to form at the
site where the stent damages the arterial wall. Since platelets
are involved in the clotting process, patients must take dual
antiplatelet therapy afterwards, usually clopidogrel and aspi-
rin for one year and aspirin indeﬁnitely. In order to reduce
the treatment, a new generation of stent has been developed
with biodegradable polymer.

[0161] However, the dual antiplatelet therapy may be
insufficient to fully prevent clots that may result in stent
thrombosis; these and the cell proliferation may cause the
standard (“bare-metal”) stents to become blocked (resteno-
sis). Drug-eluting stents were designed to lessen this prob-
lem; by releasing an antiproliferative drug (drugs typically

Jan. 31, 2019

used against cancer or as imrnunosuppressants), they can
help avoid this in-stent restenosis (re-narrowing).

Example 1

Materials and Methods for Study 1

[0165] Study Design and Subjects. The SPACING study
was a randomized, open-label, single-center, crossover
study in healthy volunteers aged 40 or older. The study was
performed in accordance with standard ethical principles;
written consent was obtained from all patients. Exclusion
criteria were subjects with a bleeding diathesis or a history
of gastrointestinal bleeding, hemorrhagic stroke, illicit drug
or alcohol abuse, coagulopathy, major surgery within 6
weeks prior to randomization, platelet count <100.000/mm3,
hematocrit<25%, creatinine>4 mg/dL, elevated liver
enzymes, or current use of NSAIDs, anticoagulants, or
antiplatelet drugs other than aspirin. The study design is
shown in FIG. 2.

[0166] Subjects were screened for eligibility if pre-therapy
20 M adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-induced maximal
aggregation was 270%. Thirty Subjects were then randomly
assigned to receive each of the ﬁrst two treatment regimens
in a crossover fashion as follows: 300 mg clopidogrel+one
325 mg tablet of Ecotrin® on day 1 followed by 75 mg
clopidogrel+one 325 mg tablet of Ecotrin® on days 2-7
(ECASA+C); or 300 mg clopidogrel+one tablet of PA32540
on day 1 followed by 75 mg clopidogrel+one tablet of
PA32540 on days 2-7 (PA32540+C). During the ﬁrst two
treatment periods, a protocol amendment was ﬁnalized by
the institutional review board to include a third treatment
period. During day l of treatment period 3, subjects were
administered one tablet of PA32540 in the moming+one
tablet of 300 mg clopidogrel 10 hours later followed by one
tablet of PA32540 in the morning+one tablet of 75 mg
clopidogrel 10 hours later on days 2-7 (PA32540+C—S).
There was a minimum washout period of 14 days between
each treatment period.

[0138] C, Arterial Stenosis

[0139] l, Carotid Stenosis

[0140] Carotid stenosis is a narrowing or constriction of
the inner surface (lumen) of the carotid artery, usually
caused by atherosclerosis The carotid artery is the large
artery whose pulse can be felt on both sides of the neck
under the jaw, It starts from the aorta as the common carotid
artery, and at the throat it forks into the internal carotid artery
and the external carotid artery. The internal carotid artery
supplies the brain, and the external carotid artery supplies
the face, This fork is a common site for atherosclerosis, an
inﬂannnatory buildup of plaque that can narrow the conunon
or internal artery,

[0141] The plaque can be stable and asymptomatic, or it
can be a source of embolization. Emboli (solid pieces) break
off from the plaque and travel through the circulation to
blood vessels in the brain, As the vessel gets smaller, they
can lodge in the vessel wall and restrict blood ﬂow to parts
of the brain that that vessel supplies, This ischemia can
either be temporary giving a transient ischemic attack, or
permanent resulting in a thromboembolic stroke.

[0142] Transient ischemic attacks (TlAs) are a warning
sign, and are oﬂen followed by severe permanent strokes,
particularly within the ﬁrst two days. TIAs by deﬁnition last
less than 24 hours (and usually last a few minutes), and
usually take the form ofa weakness or loss of sensation of
a limb or the trunk on one side of the body, or loss of sight
(amaurosis fugax) in one eye. Less common symptoms are
artery sounds (bruits), or ringing in the ear (tinnitis).
[0143] 2, Renal Stenosis

[0144] Renal artery stenosis is the narrowing of the renal
artery, mo st often caused by atherosclerosis or ﬁbromuscular
dysplasia This narrowing of the renal artery can impede
blood ﬂow to the target kidney, Hypertension and atrophy of
the affected kidney may result from renal artery stenosis,
ultimately leading to renal failure if not treated.

[0145] Atherosclerosis is the predominant cause of renal
artery stenosis in the majority of patients, usually those with
a sudden onset of hypertension at age 50 or older, Fibro-
muscular dysplasia is the predominant cause in young
patients, usually females under 40 years of age. A variety of
other causes exist. These include arteritis, renal artery aneu-
rysm, extrinsic compression (e,g., neoplasms), neuroﬂbro-
matosis, and ﬁbrous bands,

[0146] D. Vein/Arterial Graft Transplant

[0147] Veins and arteries are used by vascular surgeons for
autotransplantation in coronary artery bypass operations In
such procedures, one major concern is post-operative
inﬂammation, stenosis and blockage. While arterial graﬁs
may be desired, vein grafts are more common, and preferred
when many grafts are required, such as in a triple bypass or
quadruple bypass,

[0148] The great saphenous vein (GSV) is the large (sub-
cutaneous) superﬁcial vein of the leg and thigh, The great
saphenous vein is the conduit of choice for vascular sur-
geons, when available, for doing peripheral arterial bypass
operations because it has superior long-temt patency com-
pared to synthetic graﬁs, human umbilical vein grafts or

Jan. 3], 2019

biosynthetic graﬂs. Oﬂen, it is used in situ aﬂer tying olf
smaller tributaries and stripping of the valves.

[0149] E, Atherosclerosis

[0150] Atherosclerosis (also known as arteriosclerotic
vascular disease or ASVD) is a condition in which an artery
wall thickens as the result of a build-up of fatty materials
such as cholesterol. It is a syndrome affecting arterial blood
vessels, a chronic inﬂammatory response in the walls of
arteries, in large part due to the accumulation of macrophage
white blood cells and promoted by low-density lipoproteins
(plasma proteins that carry cholesterol and triglycerides)
without adequate removal of fats and cholesterol from the
macrophages by functional high density lipoproteins (HDL).
It is commonly referred to as a hardening or furring of the
arteries. It is caused by the formation of multiple plaques
within the aneries, Atherosclerosis is a chronic disease that
remains asymptomatic for decades.

[0151] The atheromatous plaque is divided into three
distinct components:

[0152] the atheroma, which is the nodular accumulation
of a soﬂ, ﬂaky, yellowish material at the center of large
plaques, composed of macrophages nearest the lumen
of the artery

[0153] underlying areas of cholesterol crystals

[0154] calciﬁcation at the outer base of older/more
advanced lesions

[0155] Atherosclerotic lesions, or atherosclerotic plaques
are separated into two broad categories: stable and unstable
(also called vulnerable), The pathobiology of atherosclerotic
lesions is very complicated but generally, stable atheroscle-
rotic plaques, which tend to be asymptomatic, are rich in
extracellular matrix and smooth muscle cells, while,
unstable plaques are rich in macrophages and foam cells and
the extracellular matrix separating the lesion from the arte-
rial lumen (also known as the ﬂbrous cap) is usually weak
and prone to rupture. Ruptures of the ﬁbrous cap, expose
thrombogenic material, such as collagen to the circulation
and eventually induce thrombus formation in the lumen.
Upon formation, intraluminal thrombi can occlude arteries
outright (i.ei, coronary occlusion), but more often they
detach, move into the circulation and eventually occlude
smaller downstream branches causing thromboembolism
(i.e,, Stroke is oﬂen caused by thrombus formation in the
carotid arteries). Apart from thromboembolism, chronically
expanding atherosclerotic lesions can cause complete clo-
sure of the lumen, Interestingly, chronically expanding
lesions are often asymptomatic until lumen stenosis is so
severe that blood supply to downstream tissue(s) is insuﬂi-
cient resulting in ischemia,

[0156] These complications of advanced atherosclerosis
are chronic, slowly progressive and cumulative, Most com-
monly, soft plaque suddenly ruptures (see vulnerable
plaque), causing the formation of a thrombus that will
rapidly slow or stop blood ﬂow, leading to death of the
tissues fed by the artery in approximately 5 minutes, This
catastrophic event is called an infarction. One of the most
conunon recognized scenarios is called coronary thrombosis
of a coronary artery, causing myocardial infarction. Even
worse is the same process in an artery to the brain, com-
monly called strokei Another common scenario in very
advanced disease is claudication from insufﬁcient blood
supply to the legs, typically due to a combination of both
stenosis and aneurysmal segments narrowed with clots.
Since atherosclerosis is a body-wide process, similar events

each head is coated with a distinct enteric polymer. For
example, Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid) L30D-55 permits
relwse of drug when pH is greater than 5, Aquoat (Hyper-
mellose Acetate Succinate) M grade permits release of drug
when pH is greater than 6. and Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic
Acid) FS 30D or S-100 permit release of drug when pH is
greater than 7. Pulsed delivery of clopidogrel with imme-
diate release omeprazole can be achieved by compressing
two or more types of clopidogrel beadswithin a matrix of
immediate release clopidogrel and omeprazole powder and/
or granule blend into a single tablet,

[0097] B. Three Drug Combinations

[0098] In another embodiment, the invention encompasses
novel drug formulations that permit the concurrent dosing of
clopidogrel with NSAID/PPI delivery. As above, the goal is
to spread the clopidogrel delivery over about 1 to 12 hours,
and to have multiple clopidogrel plasma concentration peaks
separated from each other and from the earlier release of
PPI. This increases the duration of platelet inhibition by
extending the duration of the plasma exposure of clopi-
dogrel, while concomitantly decreasing clopidogrel’s poten-
tial to interact with the CYP2C19-metabolized PPIs by
reducing the initial dose of clopidogrel, The follow-on doses
will be exposed to the liver enzymes about 1-12 hours after
the initial dose, therefore, avoiding competition with PPl’s.
These formulations will provide separation of PPI and one
or more clopidogrel peak releases by 3 or more hours, 6 or
more hours, 9 or more hours, 10 or more hours, 11 or more
hours or about 12 hours, including ranges such as 3-6 hours,
6-9 hours, 9-12, hours, 6-12 hours. 3-9 hours and 3-12 hours.

[0099] The following is a discussion of various formula-
tions which can achieve the aforementioned goals, without
limiting the possible formulations.

[0100]

[0101] A core of clopidogrel is compression coated with
aspirin, possibly separated by a ﬁlmcoatr This combined
core is then then coated with an enteric polymer that is pH
sensitive. For example, Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid)
L30D-55 permits release of drug when pH is greater than 5,
Aquoat (Hypermellose Acetate Succinate) M grade permits
release of drug when pH is greater than 6, and Eudragit
(Methyl Acrylic Acid) FS 30D or S—lOO permit release of
drug when pH is greater than 7. A FF] is then sprayed onto
the tablet in ﬁlmcoat, or compression coated onto the tablet.

[0102] 2. Coated Bilayer Tablet

[0103] A bilayer tablet comprised of clopidogrel and aspi-
rin is coated with an enteric polymer that is pH sensitive. For
example, Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid) L30D-55 permits
release of drug when pH is greater than 5, Aquoat (Hyper-
mellose Acetate Succinate) M grade permits release of drug
when pH is greater than 6, and Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic
Acid) FS 30D or S-100 permit release of drug when pH is
greater than 7. PM is then sprayed or compression coated on
the outside of the tablet.

[0104] 3. Multi-Particulate Capsule

[0105] Multiple particles or beads of clopidogrel and
aspirin are coated with an enteric polymer that is pH
sensitive. For example, Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid)
L30D-55 permits release of drug when pH is greater than 5,
Aquoat (Hypermellose Acetate Succinate) M grade permits
relwse of drug when pH is greater than 6, and Eudragit
(Methyl Acrylic Acid) FS 30D or S—lOO permit release of

l. Concentric Compressed Tablet

Jan. 3], 2019

drug when pH is greater than 7. These are then distributed
into a capsule containing immediate release beads, slugs, or
granules of omeprazole.

[0106] 4. Multi-Tablet Capsule

[0107] A multi-tablet capsule approach consists of imme-
diate release cores of clopidogrel, aspirin, and omeprazole
tablets. Clopidogrel and aspirin cores are coated with a
distinct enteric polymer that is pH sensitive. For example,
Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid) L30D-55 permits release of
drug when pH is greater than 5, Aquoat (Hypermellose
Acetate Succinate) M grade permits release of drug when
pH is greater than 6, and Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid) FS
30D or S-100 permit release of drug when pH is greater than
7. The enteric coated clopidogrel, enteric coated aspirin, and
the immediate release omeprazole cores are then enclosed in
one capsule.

[0108] 5, Multi-Particulate Tablet

[0109] A multi-particulate tablet approach would start
with immediate release beads of clopidogrel and aspirin.
Clopidogrel and aspirin beads are coated with a distinct
enteric polymer that is pH sensitive. For example, Eudragit
(Methyl Acrylic Acid) L30D-55 permits release of drug
when pH is greater than 5, Aquoat (Hypermellose Acetate
Succinate) M grade permits reease of drug when pH is
greater than 6, and Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid) FS 30D
or 8-100 permit release of drug when pH is greater than 7.
One would then compress the enteric coated clopidogrel and
enteric coated aspirin beads witiin a matrix of immediate
release powder and/or granule blend into a single tablet.
[0110] C. Sequential Release Three Combination Tablets
[0111] In another embodiment, the invention encompasses
novel drug formulations that permit the concurrent dosing of
clopidogrel with NSAID and P I delivery. The goal is to
deliver the entire dose of clopidogrel immediately after
ingestion of a three combination tablet. In addition to
immediately releasing the clopidogrel, the three combina-
tion tablet will sequentially de iver an innnediate release
dose of PPI after the majority o clopidogrel dose has been
delivered. Asprin will be delivered after both clopidogrel
and PPI have been sequentially delivered in this three
combination tabletr This sequential delivery allows for
clopidogrel to be exposed the t e CYP2C19 enzyme ﬁrst,
therefore, clopidogrel metabolism is not impeded or is
subject to minimum competition from omeprazole. This
three combination tablet will provide separation of clopi-
dogrel and PPI from liver enzyme competition.

[0112] The following is a discussion of various formula-
tions which can achieve the aforementioned goals, without
limiting the possible formulations.

[0113] l. Multi-Layered Tablet

[0114] A core of aspirin is enteric coated. Then an imme-
diate release layer of omeprazole is spray coated on the
enteric coated aspirin tablet. Then an immediate layer of
clopidogrel is spray coated over the omeprazole layer,
possibly separated by non-release controlling ﬁlm coats.
This will allow for sequential delivery of clopidogrel,
omeprazole, and aspirin.

[0115] 2. Coated Bilayer Tablet

[0116] A bilayer tablet comprised of omeprazole and aspi-
rin is coated with an enteric polymer that is pH sensitive. For
example, Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid) L30D-55 permits
release of drug when pH is greater than 5, Aquoat (Hyper-
mellose Acetate Succinate) M grade permits release of drug
when pH is greater than 6, and Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic
US 2019/0030008 A1

Acid) FS 30D or S-lOO permit release of drug when pH is
greater than 7. Clopidogrel is then sprayed or compression
coated on the outside of the tablet.

[0117] 3. Concentric Compressed Tablet

[0118] A core of aspirin is compression coated with
omeprazole, possibly separated by a ﬁlmcoat. This com-
bined core is then coated with outer layer of immediate
release clopidogrel. This allows for sequential delievery of
clopidogrel and omeprazole/aspirin.

IV DISEASES STATES

[0119] The formulations of the present invention are
designed in general for antiplatelet (AP) therapies. AP
therapies ﬁnd use in a variety or cardiovascular risk situa-
tions, such as stroke, heart attack, arterial stenosis, vein graft
transplant, atherosclerosis and stent placement. The follow-
ing is a brief discussion of these states.

[0120] A. Stroke

[0121] A stroke, also known as a cerebrovascular accident
(CVA), is the rapidly developing loss of brain function(s)
due to disturbance in the blood supply to the brain. This can
be due to ischemia (lack of blood ﬂow) caused by blockage
(thrombosis, arterial embolism), or a hemorrhage (leakage
of blood). As a result, the aifected area of the brain is unable
to function, leading to inability to move one or more limbs
on one side of the body, inability to understand or fonnulate
speech, or an inability to see one side of the visual ﬁeld.
[0122] A stroke is a medical emergency and can cause
permanent neurological damage, complications, and lead to
death. It is the leading cause ofadult disability in the United
States and Europe and it is the second leading cause of death
worldwide. Risk factors for stroke include advanced age,
hypertension (high blood pressure), previous stroke or tran-
sient ischemic attack (TIA), diabetes, high cholesterol, ciga-
rette smoking and atrial ﬁbrillation. High blood pressure is
the most important modiﬁable risk factor of stroke.

[0123] An ischemic stroke is occasionally treated in a
hospital with thrombolysis (also known as a “clot buster”),
and some hemorrhagic strokes beneﬁt from neurosurgery.
Treatment to recover any lost function is stroke rehabilita-
tion, ideally in a stroke unit and involving health professions
such as speech and language therapy, physical therapy and
occupational therapy. Prevention of recurrence may involve
the administration of antiplatelet dnigs such as aspirin and
dipyridamole, control and reduction of hypertension, and the
use of statins Selected patients may beneﬁt from carotid
endarterectomy and the use of anticoagulants

[0124] Strokes can be classiﬁed into two major categories:
ischemic and hemorrhagic, Ischemic strokes are those that
are caused by interruption of the blood supply, while hem-
orrhagic strokes are those which result from rupture of a
blood vessel or an abnormal vascular structure. About 87%
of strokes are caused by ischemia, and the remainder by
hemorrhage. Some hemorrhages develop inside areas of
ischemia (“hemorrhagic transformation”). It is unknown
how many hemorrhages actually start as ischemic stroke,
[0125] B. Myocardial Infarction

[0126] Myocardial infarction (M1) or acute myocardial
infarction (AMI), commonly known as a heart attack, is the
interruption of blood supply to a part of the heart, causing
heart cells to die. This is most commonly due to occlusion
(blockage) of a coronary artery following the rupture of a
Vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque, which is an unstable col-
lection of lipids (fatty acids) and white blood cells (espe-

Jan. 3], 2019

cially macrophages) in the wall of an artery. The resulting
ischemia (restriction in blood supply) and oxygen shortage,
if left untreated for a sufﬁcient period of time, can cause
damage or death (infarction) of heart muscle tissue (myo-
cardium),

[0127] Classical symptoms ofacute myocardial infarction
include sudden chest pain (typically radiating to the left arm
or left side of the neck), shortness of breath, nausea, vom-
iting, palpitations, sweating, and anxiety (often described as
a sense of impending doom), Among the diagnostic tests
available to detect heart muscle damage are an electrocar-
diogram (ECG), echocardiography, and various blood tests.
The most often used markers are the creatine kinase-MB
(CK-MB) fraction and the troponin levels Immediate treat-
ment for suspected acute myocardial infarction includes
oxygen, aspirin, and sublingual nitroglycerin.

[0128] Heart attacks are the leading cause of death for
both men and women worldwide. Important risk factors
include previous cardiovascular disease, older age, tobacco
smoking, high blood levels of certain lipids (triglycerides,
low-density lipoprotein) and low levels of high density
lipoprotein (HDL), diabetes, high blood pressure, obesity,
chronic kidney disease. heart failure, excessive alcohol
consumption, the abuse of certain drugs (such as cocaine and
methamphetamine), and chronic high stress levels.

[0129] There are two basic types of acute myocardial
infarction. Transmural infarctions are associated with ath-
erosclerosis involving a major coronary artery. It can be
subclassiﬁed into anterior, posterior, or inferior. Transmural
infarcts extend through the whole thickness of the heart
muscle and are usually a result of complete occlusion of the
area’s blood supply. Subendocardial infarctions involve a
small area in the subendocardial wall of the left ventricle,
ventricular septum, or papillary muscles. Subendocardial
infarcts are thought to result from locally decreased blood
supply, possibly from a narrowing of the coronary arteries.
The subendocardial area is farthest from the heart’s blood
supply and is more susceptible to this type of pathology.
[0130] Clinically, a myocardial infarction can be further
subclassiﬁed into a ST elevation MI (STEMI) versus a
non-ST elevation MI (non-STEMI) based on ECG changes.
A2007 consensus document classiﬁes myocardial infarction
into ﬁve main types:

[0131] Type liSpontaneous myocardial infarction
related to ischaemia due to a primary coronary event
such as plaque erosion and/or rupture, ﬁssuring, or
dissection

[0132] Type ZiMyocardial infarction secondary to
ischaemia due to either increased oxygen demand or
decreased supply, e.g. coronary artery spasm, coronary
embolism, anaemia, arrhythmias, hypertension, or
hypotension

[0133] Type SiSudden unexpected cardiac death,
including cardiac arrest, often with symptoms sugges-
tive of myocardial ischaemia, accompanied by presum-
ably new ST elevation, or new LBBB, or evidence of
fresh thrombus in a coronary artery by angiography
and/or at autopsy, but death occurring before blood
samples could be obtained, or at a time before the
appearance of cardiac biomarkers in the blood

[0134] Type 47Associated with coronary angioplasty
or stents:

mg oral doses of clopidogrel (base), plasma concentrations
of the parent compound, which has no platelet inhibiting
eﬁect, are very low and are generally below the quantiﬁca-
tion limit (0.000258 mg/L) beyond two hours after dosing,
Following an oral dose of L4C-labeled clopidogrel in
humans, approximately 50% was excreted in the urine and
approximately 46% in the feces in the ﬁve days aﬁer dosing
[0041] Administration of clopidogrel bisulfate with meals
did not signiﬁcantly modify the bioavailability of clopi-
dogrel as assessed by the pharmacokinetics of the main
circulating metabolite Clopidogrel is rapidly absorbed after
oral administration of repeated doses of 75 mg clopidogrel
(base), with peak plasma levels (approx, 3 mg/L) of the main
circulating metabolite occurring approximately one hour
after dosing. The pharmacokinetics of the main circulating
metabolite are linear (plasma concentrations increased in
proportion to dose) in the dose range of 50 to 150 mg of
clopidogrel. Absorption is at least 50% based on urinary
excretion of clopidogrel-related metabolites. Clopidogrel
and the main circulating metabolite bind reversibly in vitro
to human plasma proteins (98% and 94%, respectively), The
binding is nonsaturable in vitro up to a concentration of 110
lug/mL, In vitro and in vivo, clopidogrel undergoes rapid
hydrolysis into its carboxylic acid derivative, In plasma and
urine, the glucuronide of the carboxylic acid derivative is
also observed.

[0042] Clopidogrel is a pro-drug activated in the liver by
cytochrome P450 enzymes, including CYP2C19, The active
membolite has an elimination half-life of about eight hours
and acts by forming a disulﬁde bridge with the platelet ADP
receptor. Several recent landmark studies have proven the
importance of CYP2C19 genotyping in treatment using
clopidogrel or Plavix, In March 2010, the US FDA placed
a Box Warning on Plavix to make patients and healthcare
providers aware that CYP2C19 poor metabolizers, repre-
senting up to 14% of patients, are at high risk of treatment
failure and that testing is available. Researchers have found
that patients with variants in cytochrome P-450 2Cl9
(CYP2C19) have lower levels of the active metabolite of
clopidogrel, less inhibition of platelets, and a 3.58-fold
greater risk for major adverse cardiovascular events such as
death, heart attack, and stroke; the risk was greatest in
CYP2C19 poor metabolizers. CYP2C19 is an important
drug-metabolizing enzyme that catalyzes the biotransforma-
tion of many clinically useful drugs including antidepres-
sants, barbiturates, proton pump inhibitors, antimalarial and
antitumor drugs, Clopidogrel is one of the drugs metabo-
lized by this enzyme.

[0043] Serious adverse drug reactions associated with
clopidogrel therapy include:

[0044] severe neutropenia (low white blood cells) (inci-
dence: l/2,000)

[0045] thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (T TP)
(incidence: 4/ 1,000,000 patients treated)

[0046] hemorrhage (the annual incidence of hemor-
rhage may be increased by the co-administration of
aspirin)

[0047] gastrointestinal hemorrhage (incidence: 2.0%
annually)

[0048] cerebral hemorrhage (incidence: 0.1 to 0.4%
annually)

Use of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs is discouraged
in those taking clopidogrel due to increased risk of digestive
tract hemorrhage (Diener et al., Lancet 364-331-7, 2004).

Jan. 31, 2019

[0049] Clopidogrel interacts with the following drugs:
proton pump inhibitors, pienytoin (Dilantin); tamoxifen
(Nolvadex); tolbutamide (Orinase); torsemide (Demadex);
ﬂuvastatin (Lescol); a blooc thinner such as warfarin (Cou-
madin), heparin, ardeparin (Normiﬂo), dalteparin (Fragmin),
danaparoid (Orgaran), enoxaparin (Lovenox), or tinzaparin
(Innohep); Tissue Plasminogen Activator (Activase), anis-
treplase (Eminase), dipyridamole (Persantine), streptokinase
(Kabikinase, Streptase), tic opidine (Ticlid), and urokinase
(Abbokinase). In November 2009, the FDA announced that
clopidogrel should not be taken with CYP2C19 inhibitors as
omeprazole and esomeprazole.

[0050] Clopidogrel is eifective at reducing cardiovascular
events in people at high ris due to previous CVD, Clopi-
dogrel is eﬁective in reducing a combined outcome of major
cardiovascular events (MI, ischaemic stroke, vascular death)
in people with MI, stroke, or peripheral artery disease.
Thienopyridines like clopicogrel, compared with aspirin,
may decrease gastrointestinal haemorrhage but increase the
risk of skin rash or diarrhea One study of 19,185 people
with a history of MI, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease
compared clopidogrel (75 mg daily) versus aspirin (325 mg
daily) and found that clopic ogre] signiﬁcantly reduced the
risk of major cardiovascular events (deﬁned as ischaemic
stroke. Ml, or vascular death: average rate per year 5% (939
events/17,636 patient-years at risk) with clopidogrel v. 6%
(1021 events/17,519 patient-years at risk) with aspirin; RRR
8.7%, 95% CI 0.30% to 16.5%; P:0.04). Another study
showed that ticlopidine or clopidogrel modestly but signiﬁ-
cantly reduced cardiovascular events compared with aspirin
(OR 091, 95% CI 084 to 0.98; average 11 events prevented/
1000 people treated with a thienopyridine instead of aspirin

to 19 events preventch1000 people treated),

 

II. PROTON PUMP INHIBITOR/NSAID
FORMULATIONS

[0051] A. PPI’s
[0052] Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are drugs whose
main action is a pronounced and long-lasting reduction of
gastric acid production, They are the most potent inhibitors
of acid secretion available today. The group followed and
has largely superseded another group of pharmaceuticals
with similar eifects, but diﬁerent mode-of—action, called
HZ-receptor antagonists. PPIs are among the most widely-
selling drugs in the world and are generally considered
effective. The vast majority of these drugs are benzimidazole
derivatives; however, promising new research indicates that
imidazopyridine derivatives may be a more effective means
of treatment. High dose or long-tenn use of PPIs carry a
possible increased risk of bone fractures.

[0053] PPIs are utilized in the treatment of many condi-
tions such as:

[0054] dyspepsia

[0055] peptic ulcer disease (PUD)

[0056] gastroesophageal reﬂux disease (GORD/GERD)

[0057] laryngopharyngeal reﬂux

[0058] Barrett’s esophagus

[0059] prevention of stress gastritis

[0060] gastrinomas and other conditions that cause

DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE
EMBODIMENTS

 

 

 

[0029] C opidogrel is a connnonly used anti-platelet drug
for the prevention of vascular ischemic events, other acute
coronary diseases, and coronary procedures. Clopidogrel
acts by irreversibly binding/blocking speciﬁc ADP receptors
on the circulating platelets which in turn inhibit their aggre-
gation and cross linking. Platelets are regenerated continu-
ously and, therefore, a single inunediate release dose of
clopidogrel will lose its pharmacological effect once the
plasma level of the active drug dissipates. Clopidogrel is a
pro-drug and is metabolized by liver enzymes into its
pharmacologically active component. The pharmacological
effect of clopidogrel has been reported to be decreased if it
is taken with other drugs that share the same metabolic
pathway in the liver.

[0030] Thus, the ﬁeld has recognized a problem with
regard to an unfavorable interaction between clopidogrel
and PPIs. The present invention seeks to solve this problem
in at least one of three ways, or a combination thereof First,
by delaying the release of clopidogrel as compared to the
PPI, which optionally can be formulated for immediate
delivery, one can separate the delivery of each drug and
reduce the apparent competition for CYP2C19. Second, one
can deliver clopidogrel in pulses or waves, thereby achiev-
ing multiple plasma peak deliveries while decreasing plasma
peak concentrations of clopidogrel at any point. Again, this
can be coupled with immediate release PPI. Optionally, the
co-delivery of aspirin may be included. Third, one can
deliver clopidogrel ﬁrst when co-delivered with PPl to allow
for exposure of clopidogrel to the liver enzymes prior to
exposure to competing PPI.

[0031] As discussed in the Examples that follow, an
experimental drug containing aspirin and omeprazole, des-
ignated PA32540 (Pozen Inc., Chapel Hill N.C.), is the
subject of the SPACING (Spaced PA32540 with Clopidogrel
INteraction Gauging (SPACING)) Study. This study was
designed to evaluate whether platelet inhibition during dual
antiplatelet therapy with PA32540 and clopidogrel (Plavix®,
Sanoﬁ-Aventis US, Bridgewater N.J.), administered syn-
chronously or spaced 10 hours apart, was non-inferior to a

Jan. 3], 2019

strategy of synchronous administration of 325 mg EC aspi-
rin and clopidogrel. As explained below, the drug was in fact
found non-inferior.

[0032] Thus, in order to overcome the aforementioned
limitations on co—delivery of clopidogrel and PPI's, the
present invention provides solid dosage forms that can
deliver two or more smaller doses of clopidogrel at the same
total dose as commercially available products, but separated
sufﬁciently to avoid the unfavorable drug interactions of
clopidogrel with PPIs. In addition, the present invention
provides solid dosage fomis that can sequentially deliver
clopidogrel, omeprazole, and aspirin. These and other
aspects of the invention are described in detail below.

I. CLOPIDOGREL

[0033] Clopidogrel is an oral, thienopyridine class anti-
platelet agent used to inhibit blood clots in coronary artery
disease, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular
disease. It is marketed by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Sanoﬁ-
Aventis under the trade name Plavix®. Adverse effects
include hemorrhage, severe neutropenia, and thrombotic
thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).
[0034] Clopidogrel is a prodrug, the action of which may
be related to an adenosine diphosphate (ADP) receptor on
platelet cell membranes. The drug speciﬁcally and irrevers-
ibly inhibits the P2Y12 subtype of ADP receptor, which is
important in aggregation of platelets and cross-linking by
the protein ﬁbrin. The blockade of this receptor inhibits
platelet aggregation by blocking activation of the glycopro-
tein IIb/Illa pathway. The IIb/IIla complex functions as a
receptor mainly for ﬁbrinogen and vitronectin but also for
ﬁbronectin and von Willebrand factor. Activation of this
receptor complex is the “ﬁnal common pathway” for platelet
aggregation and is important in the cross-linking of platelets
by ﬁbrin. At least some platelet inhibition can be demon-
strated two hours after a single dose of oral clopidogrel, but
the onset of action is slow, so that a loading-dose of 300-600
mg is usually acministered.
[0035] Due to opening of the thiophene ring, the metabo-
lite chemical structure has three sites of chirality, making a
total of eight possible isomers. These are: (a) a stereocentre
at C4 (attached to the 7SH thiol group), (b) a stereobond at
C3-C16 double- ound and (c) the original stereocenter at
C7. Only one of the eight structures is an active antiplatelet
drug. This has the following conﬁguration; a (Z) conﬁgu-
ration at C3-Cl6 double-bound, the original (S) conﬁgura-
tion stereocenter at C7 and although the stereocentre at C4
cannot be direct y determined (the thiol group is too reac-
tive), work with the active metabolite of the related drug
Prasugrel suggests that the (R)—conﬁguration of the C4
group is critical ‘or P2Y12 and platelet-inhibitory activities.
[0036] Clopidogrel is indicated for:

[0037] prevention of vascular ischemic events in

patients Will symptomatic atherosclerosis
[0038] acute coronary syndrome without ST-segment
elevation (NSTEMI)

[0039] ST e evation MI (STEMI)
It is also used, along with aspirin, for the prevention of
thrombosis after placement of intracoronary stent or as an
alternative antiplatelet drug for patients who are intolerant to
aspirin.
[0040] Clopidogrel is marketed as clopidogrel bisulfate
(clopidogrel hydrogen sulfate), most commonly under the
trade name Plavix, as 75 mg oral tablets. After repeated 75
US 2019/0030008 A1

system (the I’I+/K+ ATPase, or more common gastric proton
pump) of the gastric parietal cells. The proton pump is the
terminal stage in gastric acid secretion, being directly
responsible for secreting H+ ions into the gastric lumen,
making it an ideal target for inhibiting acid secretion
“Irreversibility” refers to the effect on a single copy of the
enzyme; the effect on the overall human digestive system is
reversible, as the enzymes are naturally destroyed and
replaced. Targeting the terminal step in acid production, as
well as the irreversible nature of the inhibition, results in a
class of drugs that is signiﬁcantly more effective than H2
antagonists and reduces gastric acid secretion by up to 99%.
[0063] The higher pH in the stomach due to PPI therapy
will aid in the healing of duodenal ulcers, and reduces the
pain from indigestion and heartburn, which can be exacer-
bated by stomach acid. However, lack of stomach acid is
also called hypochlorhydria, the lack of suﬂicient hydro-
chloric acid, or HCl. Hydrochloric acid is required for the
digestion of proteins and for the absorption of nutrients,
particularly of vitamin B12 and of calcium.
[0064] Proton pump inhibitors are given in an inactive
form. The inactive form is neutrally charged (lipophilic) and
readily crosses cell membranes into intracellular compart-
ments (like the parietal cell canaliculus) that have acidic
environments. In an acid environment, the inactive drug is
protonated and rearranges into its active form. As described
above, the active form will covalently and irreversibly bind
to the gastric proton pump. inactivating it,
[0065] In general, the absorption of proton pump inhibi-
tors is unatfected by co-administration with food. The rate of
omeprazole absorption, however, is decreased by concomi-
tant food intake. In addition, the absorption of lansoprazole
and esomeprazole is cecreased and delayed by food, but it
has been suggested that these pharmacokinetic eﬁects have
no signiﬁcant impact on efﬁcacy. The elimination half-life of
proton pump inhibitors ranges from 05-2 hours, however
the eifect of a single ose on acid secretion usually persists
up to 2-3 days. This is because of accumulation of the drug
in parietal cell canaliculi and the irreversible nature of
proton pump inhibition
[0066] Clinically used proton pump inhibitors:

[0067] Omeprazo e (Losec®, Prilosec®, Zegerid®,

Lomac®, Omepral®, Omez®)

[0068] Lansoprazole (Prevacid®, Zoton®, Inhibitol®,
Levant®, Lupizo e®)
[0069] Dexlansoprazole (Kapidex®, Dexilant®)
[0070] Esomeprazole (Nexium®, Esotrex®)
[0071] Pantoprazole (Protonix®, Somac®, Pantoloc®,
Pantozol®, Zurca1®, Zentro®, Pan®)
[0072] Rabeprazo e (Zechin®, Rabecid®, Nzole—D®,
AcipHex®, Pariet®, Rabeloc®)
In general, proton puma inhibitors are well tolerated, and the
incidence of short-term adverse eﬁec'ts is relatively uncom-
mon. The range and occurrence of adverse eﬂects are similar
for all of the proton pump inhibitors, though they have been
reported more frequently with omeprazole, This may be due
to its longer availabi ity and, hence, clinical experience
Common adverse eﬂects include: headache, nausea, diar-
rhea, abdominal pain, fatigue, and dizziness.
[0073] A recent study has also suggested that proton pump
inhibitors signiﬁcantly decreased the effect of clopidogrel on
platelets as tested by VASP phosphorylation. The clinical
impact of these results must be assessed by further investi-

 

Jan. 31, 2019

gations, but a PPI treatment should not be added to the
antiplatelet dual therapy without formal indication.

[0074] B, Aspirin

[0075] Nonsteroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs (NSAIDs)
are drugs with analgesic and antipyretic (fever-reducing)
effects and which have, in higher doses, anti-inﬂammatory
etfects. The term “nonsteroidal” is used to distinguish these
drugs from steroids, which, among a broad range of other
etfects, have a similar eicosanoid-depressing, anti-inﬂam-
matory action. As analgesics, NSAle are unusual in that
they are non-narcotic,

[0076] Most NSAIDs act as nonselective inhibitors of the
enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), inhibiting both the
cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1) and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)
isoenzymes. COX catalyzes the formation of prostaglandins
and thromboxane from arachidonic acid (itself derived from
the cellular phospholipid bilayer by phospholipase A2),
Prostaglandins act (among other things) as messenger mol-
ecules in the process of inﬂammation Many aspects of the
mechanism of action of NSAIDs remain unexplained, and
for this reason further COX pathways are hypothesized The
COX-3 pathway was believed to ﬁll some of this gap but
recent ﬁndings make it appear unlikely that it plays any
signiﬁcant role in humans and alternative explanation mod-
els are proposed,

[0077] The widespread use of NSAIDs has meant that the
adverse effects of these drugs have become increasingly
prevalent. The two main adverse drug reactions (ADRs)
associated with NSAIDs relate to gastrointestinal (GI)
effects and renal effects of the agents. These effects are
dose-dependent, and in many cases severe enough to pose
the risk of ulcer perforation, upper gastrointestinal bleeding,
and death, limiting the use of NSAID therapy. An estimated
10-20% of NSAID patients experience dyspepsia, and
NSAID-associated upper gastrointestinal adverse events are
estimated to result in 103,000 hospitalizations and 16,500
deaths per year in the United States, and represent 43% of
drug-related emergency visits. NSAIDs, like all drugs, may
interact with other medications. For example, concurrent use
of NSAIDs and quinolones may increase the risk of quino-
lones’ adverse central nervous system eifects, including
seizure.

[0078] In people with known vascular disease, aspirin is
additionally known to reduce the incidence of non-fatal
myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and vascular death
by about a quarter. Aspirin has been shown to result in a
reduction of coronary events, and also reduces the risk of
ischemic stroke. Aspirin not only reduces the re-occurrence
of vascular catastrophes, but probably also resulted in lower
death rates. Unfortunately, aspirin also increases the risk for
GI ulcers. This effect is present in both primary and sec-
ondary prevention trials. Most cardiovascular risk patients
receive not only aspirin for secondary prevention of vascular
disease, but also other interventions such as blood pressure
control medications and statins,

[0079] It is expected that a skilled phannacologist may
adjust the amount of aspirin in a pharmaceutical composi-
tion or administered to a patient based upon standard tech-
niques well known in the art, However, aspirin will typically
be present in tablets or capsules in an amount of between
about 50 mg and 1000 mg, including 75 mg, 81.25 mg, 100
mg, 150 mg, 1625 mg, 250 mg, 300 mg, 325 mg, 400 mg,
500mg, 650mg, 800mg and 1000mg. Typical daily dosages
will be in an amount ranging from 500 mg to about 10 g for
US 2019/0030008 A1

analgesia or inﬂammation, and in an amount ranging from
50 mg to 500 mg for secondary prevention of cardiovascular
disease
[0080] C. NSAID/PPI Combinations
[0081] US, Pat, No. 6,926,907, incorporated herein by
reference, describes the advantageous coformulation of
NSAIDs and PPIs. In particular, the invention discussed
therein is directed to drug dosage forms that release an agent
that raises the pH of a patient’s gastrointestinal tract, e.g., a
PPI, followed by a non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug.
The dosage form is designed so that the NSAID is not
released until the intragastric pH has been raised to a safe
level. The invention also encompasses methods of treating
patients by administering this coordinated release, gastro-
protective combination unit dosage form to achieve pain and
symptom relief with a reduced risk of developing gastroin-
testinal damage such as ulcers, erosions and hemorrhages,
[0082] A speciﬁc form of this combination is called
Vimovo®, which is marketed by Astrazenca. V1movo® is a
combi 'on product that contains naproxen and esomepra-
zole. It is indicated for signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis,
rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis while
decreasing the risk of developing NSAID-associated gastric
complications. A particular aspect of Vimovo® action is
delayed release of naproxen. It is provided in two oral
administration forms:

[0083] 375 mg enteric coated naproxen and 20 mg

esomeprazole (as magnesium hydrate); or
[0084] 500 mg enteric coated naproxen and 20 mg
esomeprazole (as magnesium hydrate)

[0085] Another speciﬁc form of this combination is for-
mulation, PA32540 (Pozen Inc, Chapel Hill N.C.), a tablet
containing 325 mg enteric coated (EC) aspirin and 40 mg
omeprazole. It is designed to reduce aspirin-related gastro-
intestinal toxicity wliile delivering a bioequivalent dose of
aspirin. This tablet is unique in that omeprazole is not EC
(delayed release formulation) or buffered as it is in other PPI
products (Grubel et al., 2009). Instead, omeprazole is con-
tained in the outer layer of the PA32540 tablet in an
immediate release form, available for rapid dissolution (FIG.
1). Its therapeutic activity is rapid and occurs prior to the
dissolution of the aspirin component contained within the
core of the multi-layered tablet (Grubel et al., 2009). To
further ensure the sequential delivery of the two compo-
nents, the aspirin core is coated by polymers which prevent
dissolution until the pH of the surrounding environment is
>55, A bioequivalence study (PA32540-104) demonstrated
that, with respect to salicylic acid pharmacokinetics,
PA32540 is bioequivalent to commercially available 325 mg
EC aspirin (Fort et al., 2008). Compared to 81 mg EC
aspirin, PA32540 was associated with greater inhibition of in
vivo thromboxane generation and no greater upper gastro-
intestinal damage by Lanza score (Grubel et al., 2009).

 

III. FORMULATIONS

[0086] A. Dual Delivery Systems

[0087] In a ﬁrst approach, one may use distinct dosage
forms to simultaneously deliver clopidogrel and a PPI to a
patient. In general, the goal is to spread the clopidogrel
delivery over about 1 to 12 hours, and to have multiple
clopidogrel plasma pulses (deﬁned as multiple peaks in
plasma level concentration separated from each other) sepa-
rated from the earlier release of PPI. This increases the
duration of platelet inhibition by extending the duration of

Jan. 31, 2019

the plasma exposure of clopidogrel, while concomitantly
decreasing clopidogrel’s potential to interact with the
CYP2C19-metabolized PPI’s by reducing the initial dose of
clopidogrel. The follow-on doses will be exposed to the liver
enzymes about 1-12 hours after the initial dose, therefore,
avoiding competition with PPI’s. These formulations can be
used advantageously with drug formulations as described in
US. Pat. No. 6,926,907, and in particular, those discussed
above such as Vimovo® and PA32540. In such situations,
the drugs and dosings will be provided to achieve a sepa-
ration of PPI and one or more of the clopidogrel peak
releases by 3 or more hours, 6 or more hours, 9 or more
hours, 10 or more hours, 11 or more hours or about 12 hours,
including ranges such as 3-6 hours, 6-9 hours, 9-12, hours,
6-12 hours, 3-9 hours and 3-12 hours. A comparison of a
multi-pulse delivery of clopidogrel to standard clopidogrel is
shown in FIG. 7,

[0088] The following is a discussion of various clopi-
dogrel formulations which can achieve the aforementioned
goals, without limiting the possible combinations.

[0089] l. Tablet in TableUMultilayered Tablet

[0090] In one version, the formulation employs a “tablet in
a tablet” or “multilayer tablet” form, This comprises clopi-
dogrel inner core coated with an enteric polymer that is pH
sensitive. In general, the desired release range will be about
pH 5-7.5. For example, Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid)
L30D-55 permits release of drug when pH is greater than 5,
Aquoat (Hypermellose Acetate Succinate) M grade permits
release of drug when pH is greater than 6, and Eudragit
(Methyl Acrylic Acid) FS 30D or 5-100 permit release of
drug when pH is greater than 7. An immediate release
portion containing clopidogrel is compressed around the
coated core. The coated clopidogrel core is then spray-
coated with an immediate release portion containing
omeprazole.

[0091] 2, Multi-Tablet Capsule

[0092] A multi-tablet capsule approach would start with
multiple tablets having an immediate release core of clopi-
dogrel, each of which is coated with a distinct enteric
polymer that is pH sensitive, For example, Eudragit (Methyl
Acrylic Acid) L30D-55 permits release of drug when pH is
greater than 5, Aquoat (Hypermellose Acetate Succinate) M
grade permits release of drug when pH is greater than 6, and
Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid) FS 30D or 8-100 permit
release of drug when pH is greater than 7. Two or more
different clopidogrel tablets having diﬂerent release proﬁles
are then encapsulated along with an immediate release
omeprazole tablet.

[0093] 3. Multi-Particulate Capsules

[0094] Multiple clopidogrel and omeprazole beads are
enclosed in a capsule where beads are coated with a distinct
enteric polymer. For example, Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic
Acid) L30D-55 permits release of dung when pH is greater
than 5, Aquoat (Hypermellose Acetate Succinate) M grade
permits release of drug when pH is greater than 6, and
Eudragit (Methyl Acrylic Acid) FS 30D or S-100 permits
release of drug when pH is greater than 7. Pulsed delivery
of clopidogrel with immediate omeprazole can be achieved
by encapsulating two or more types of clopidogrel beads
(immediate release, enteric release) along with immediate
release ompeprazole beads.

[0095] 4, Multi-Particulate Tablets

[0096] Multi-particulate tablets include multiple clopi-
dogrel and omeprazole beads compressed into a tablet where

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

1. Field of the Invention

[0003] The present invention relates to the ﬁelds of bio]-
ogy, medicine, and pharmacology More speciﬁcally, the
invention provides novel formulations of clopidogrel and a
gastric acid inhibitor, optionally with an NSAID, and meth-
ods of use therefor.

2. Description of Related Art

[0004] Dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) with clopidogrel
and aspirin presents an eﬁective strategy to reduce ischemic
event occurrence in patients treated with coronary artery
stents in the presence or absence of an acute coronary
syndrome (ACS), but DAPT is associated with increased
risk of serious gastrointestinal bleeding (GIB) (King et al.,
2008; Moukarbel et a1., 2009); with GIB resulting in pre-
mature discontinuation of DAPT therapies and a ~25 times
increased risk of death in subjects undergoing such treat-
ment regimens (Moukarbel ct al., 2009; Bhatt et al., 2008).
As a consequence, use of proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) have
been recommended and widely adapted in patients with risk
(factors) for upper GIB treated with DAPT (Bhatt et al.,
2008).

[0005] Compared to its use without a PPI, concomitant use
of clopidogrel and PPIs has been associated with an altenu-
ated pharrnacodynamic effect of clopidogrel and a potential
reduction in the clinical beneﬁts of clopidogrel after ACS
(Gurbel et all, 2010; Gurbel and Tantr'y, 2011; Angiolillo et
al., 2011; Ferreiro et al., 2010). However, other studies have
not supported an elfect of PPIs on major cardiovascular
outcomes in patients treated with clopidogrel (Gurbel and
Tantry, 2011). Despite the lack of consensus on the clinical
signiﬁcance of this drug interaction, both the Food and Drug
Administration and the European Medicines Agency have
issued warnings about the interaction and have adjusted
product information.

[0006] Although the precise cause of the phar'rnacody-
namic interaction between clopidogrel and enteric coated
PPIs is unknown, reports suggest that insuﬁicient clopi-
dogrel active metabolite generation results from competition
of PPIs and clopidogrel for metabolism by cytochrome P450
(CYP) 2C19 (Angiolillo et al., 2011). This has led to the
suggestion that separating the dosing of clopidogrel and
PPIs would reduce the amount of omeprazole competing for
the same enzymatic site as clopidogrel (Laine and Hennek-
ens, 2010). However, several studies have reported that
spacing of clopidogrel and enteric coated (EC) omeprazole
dosing in healthy volunteers did not lessen the interaction
(Angiolillo et al., 2011; Ferreiro et al., 2010). An experi-
mental drug, PA32540 (Pozen Incl, Chapel Hill NC.) con-
tains omeprazole and enteric-coated aspirin. However, the
release mechanisms of PA32540 are associated with a sub-
stantially diﬂerent omeprazole pharmacokinetic proﬁle
compared to commercially available (enterically coated)

Jan. 31, 2019

omeprazole, and the etfect of PA32540 on clopidogrel’s
antiplatelet eﬁect is currently unknown (Gurbel et al., 2009).
Thus, there remains a need to identify new approaches to the
delivery of clopidogrel to subjects in need thereof

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0007] The present invention is designed to provide new
antiplatelet therapies, particularly those that provide treat-
ments for subjects at risk of secondary cardiovascular
events. The treatments are designed to deliver PPIs, such as
omeprazole, and clopidogrel in either a coformulation or in
simultanenously delivered individual formulations In addi-
tion, the invention provides the delivery of clopidogrel in
pulses or waves, such that the total dose is phased/ spread out
over time and, advantageously, combined with omeprazole
in a way to minimize the conﬂicting actions these two drugs
may have on each other. In addition, the invention also
provides the delivery of clopidogrel and a PPI, and option-
ally aspirin, in a sequential (orderly) manner that would
allow for the delivery and metabolism of clopidogrel ﬁrst,
followed by the PPI, and thereafter optionally aspirin. A
particular mode of the invention involves the combination of
clopidogrel with coformulatcd immediate release omepra-
zole +enteric coated aspirinr The subject may suffer from or
be at risk of stroke, heart attack, arterial stenosis or athero-
sclerosis, or has undergone or will undergo vein graft
transplant or stent placement.

[0008] Thus, in accordance with the present invention,
there is provided a method of providing an antiplatelet
therapy to a subject in need thereof comprising co-admin-
istering to said subject a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) and
clopidogrel such that (a) said clopidogrel and said omepra-
zole are delivered in a sequential manner; (b) said clopi-
dogrel is released (i) prior to or (ii) prior to and after said
PPI; and (c) said PPI achieves a peak plasma concentration
at least 1 hour alter a ﬁrst clopidogrel peak plasma concen-
tration. The clopidogrel may delivered in multiple pulses,
suc‘l as 2, 3 or 4 pulses.

[0009] The PPI may achieve a peak plasma concentration
at least 2 hours prior to a second, third or fourth clopidrogrel
pulse, at least 4 hours prior to a second, third or fourth
clopidrogrel pulse, or at least 6 hours prior to a second, third
or ourth clopidrogrel pulse The subject may further be
administered aspirin, such as aspirin formulated for enteric
release. The clopidogrel and PPI may be coformulated in a
single drug formulation, which may further include aspirin.
Suci a triple combination may comprise an aspirin core, a
PPI layer surrounding said aspirin core, and a clopidogrel
layer surrounding said PPI layerr Alternatively, the clopi-
dogrel and the PPI may be formulated individually but
administered at the same time. The subject may suffer from
or e at risk of stroke, heart attack, arterial stenosis or
atherosclerosis, or may have or may undergo vein graft
transplant or stent placement.

[0010] The PPI may achieve a peak plasma concentration
at east 2 hours after the ﬁrst clopidogrel peak plasma
concentration, or may achieve a peak plasma concentration
at about 2-6 hours aﬁer the ﬁrst clopidogrel peak plasma
concentration. The clopidogrel may be pulsed twice at about
37.5 mg per pulse, or pulsed three times at about 25 mg per
pulse. The PPI may be selected from the group consisting of
omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole, esomeprazole,
rabeprazole, and dexlansoprazole. In the case of omepra-

clopidogrel at least 10 hours lateriapproximately one hour
prior to dinner. In the morning of Treatment Day 5, subjects
were reminded not to drink any calfeinated beverages, or to
eat any dark chocolate until after the Day 7 blood sampling
Concomitant medications were reviewed and adverse events
recorded as appropriate. On Treatment Day 6, a urine drug
screen was performed on all subjects,
[0200] Day 7: Treatment A. Alter at least a 10 hour
overnight fast, subjects received PA32540 with 240 ml of
water in the moming and were served a standard breakfast
approximately one hour after dosing. Approximately two
hours alter dosing, a blood sample was obtained for AA-
induced platelet aggregation evaluation. Subjects returned to
the Research unit for PM dosing of clopidogrel at least 10
hours aﬁer the AM dosing of PA32540 and approximately
two hours later had a blood sample taken for ADP-induced
platelet aggregation evaluation. Subjects were discharged
aﬁer all study related procedures are completed,
[0201] Treatment B: Aﬁer at least a 10 hour overnight fast,
subjects received clopidogrel, EC aspirin 81 mg and EC
omeprazole 40 mg all dosed concomitantly with 240 ml of
water in the morning and served a standard breakfast
approximately one hour after dosing. Approximately two
hours after dosing, subjects had a blood sample taken for
AA- and ADP-induced platelet aggregation evaluation. Sub-
jects were discharged after all study related procedures were
completed.
[0202] Washout Period: There was at least a 14-day wash-
out period between the last dose in Period 1 and the ﬁrst dose
in Period 2 where the above procedures (from Day 1) were
repeated aﬁer subjects were crossed over to the other treat-
ment regimen. Clinical adverse events were recorded and
concomitant medications reviewed and recorded throughout
this period.
[0203] End of Study Assessments: Prior to discharge from
the Research unit on Day 7 of treatment Period 2, the
following procedures were completed: vital signs, blood
draw for clinical laboratory analyses, urine collection for
urinalysis, collection of adverse events and concomitant
medications. These procedures were performed whenever a
subject discontinued from the study prematurely.

[0251] Criteria for Evaluation:

[0252] Eﬂicacy: Platelet aggregation tests; chronolog
using 20 pM ADP and 2 mM AA as agonists.

[0253] Safety: Vital signs, clinical laboratory tests and
adverse events.

[0254] Sample Size: The sample size for this study was
calculated using the statistical software nQuery Advisor
version 6.0. A sample size of 30 subjects in each treatment
(15 per sequence in a crossover fashion) has >90% power to
detect a mean difference of 10 in inhibition of platelet
aggregation (IPA) between PA32540 plus Clopidogrel dosed
separately and EC aspirin 81 mg plus EC omeprazole 40 mg
plus Clopidogrel dosed concomitantly using a two-sample
t-test at 5% two-sided signiﬁcance level assuming that the
mean IPA of PA32540 plus Clopidogrel dosed separately is
40 and the standard deviation of treatment ditferences is 14.
[0255] Analysis of Platelet aggregation: The endpoint
measure was IPA deﬁned as IPA (%):[l-PA7/PAO]><100
where PA7 is the platelet aggregation (PA) at day 7 and PAO
is the platelet aggregation at baseline. The lPA was analyzed
using analyses of variance (ANOVA). The ANOVA model

Jan. 31, 2019

included sequence, period and treatment as ﬁxed eﬁects, and
subjects within sequence as a random eﬁect. The mean
dilferences of treatments were tested and p-values reported.
The differences between treatment least-squares (LS) means
and associated 95% conﬁdence intervals were calculated:
[0256] Safety Analysis: Adverse events were coded using
the MedDRA (Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities)
and summarized for each treatment by SOC and preferred
term. Tabulations and listings of values for vital signs and
clinical laboratory tests were presented.

Results for Study 2

[0257] As shown by the data that follow, PA32450 (en-
teric-coated aspirin 325 mg and immediate-release omepra-
zole 40 mg) given in conjunction with Clopidogrel, dosed at
least 10 hours apart, resulted in signiﬁcantly better inhibition
of ADP-induced platelet aggregation when compared to
current standard of care (81 mg of enteric-coated aspirin,
enteric-coated 40 mg omeprazole and Clopidogrel). The
improvement was approximately 20%. Tables 4-27 show the
details of the Study.

rather than 80mg omeprazole, If the interaction is due to the
result of competitive inhibition at CYP2C19, lower plasma
concentrations of omeprazole would produce less drug-drug
interaction. PA32540 has an immediate-release omeprazole
formulation with peak plasma levels at 30 minutes, The
drug-drug interaction was observed at 1 day post-dose when
dosed together but not when dosed separately This obser-
vation suggests an immediate competitive inhibition since
symchronous administration would lead to overlapping high
plasma levels of omeprazole and clopidogrel (peak plasma
levels at 30-60 minutes). But, with separate dosing omepra-
zole plasma levels are expected to be undetectable at the
time of peak clopidogrel plasma levels at 1 day post-dose. At
day 7 post-dose an effect on platelet aggregation was also
observed when doses were administered together and less
when doses were separate. In the SPACING study, subjects
were treated with 325 mg aspirin which may have effects on
ADP-induced platelet aggregation In the previous studies of
drug spacing, aspirin was excluded.

[0189] This study is discordant with previous studies
demonstrating that omeprazole attenuates aspirin bioavail-
ability, and the eﬂect of aspirin on platelet aggregation
(Wiirtz et all, 2010; Giraud et a1., 1997). Here, the inventor
found no difference in the antiplatelet etfects measured by
arachidonic acid stimulation in PA32540 versus ECASA
treated subjects. A previous study by the inventor’s group
cemonstrated greater reduction in urinary ll-dehydro
ttromboxane B2 levels in subjects treated with PA32540
versus 81 mg enteric coated ASA (Gurbel et al,. 2009).
[0190] The present study consisted of healthy volunteers
40 years of age; similar ﬁndings may not occur in the
analysis of platelet function in patients with coronary artery
cisease, Secondly, the study did not assess pharmacokinet-
ics, which may have elucidated a mechanism for the reduced
interaction occurring after spaced therapyi Genotyping to
cetermine CYP 2C19 loss-of-function and gain-of-function
allele carrier status was not performed Also, the inventor
cid not compare the antiplatelet response of clopidogrel
between the immediate-release formulations of omeprazole
in PA32540 and delayed-release omeprazole, Finally, simi-
lar to previous studies, the inventor only assessed the
interaction for a short period of time Extrapolation of these
cata to long-tenn etfects would be highly speculative. Dif-
ferent pharmacodynamic effects of spaced therapy from
tiose observed in the current study may occur in patients
treated with other agents metabolized by the CYP2C19
pathwayi

[0191] In conclusion, the inventor reports that the spacing
of PA32540 and clopidogrel therapy signiﬁcantly reduced
tie pharmacodynamic interaction observed during synchro-
nous administration, Further studies evaluating a strategy
tiat spaces PA32540 and clopidogrel therapy are warranted
to conﬁrm the inventor’s observations.

Materials and Methods for Study 2

[0192] Objectives: The primary objective of this trial was
to to evaluate adenosine diphosphate (ADP)—induced plate-
let aggregation following administration of clopidogrel, EC
aspirin 81 mg and EC omeprazole 40 mg, all dosed con-
comitantly, and PA32540 and clopidogrel dosed separately
Secondarily, the goal was to evaluate arachidonic acid
(AA)—induced platelet aggregation following administration

Jan. 31, 2019

of clopidogrel, EC aspirin 81 mg and EC omeprazole 40 mg,
all dosed concomitantly, and PA32540 and clopidogrel
dosed separately. Finally, the safety of each of the treatment
arms was to be assessed.

[0193] Methodology: This was a randomized, open-label,
single-center, cross-over study in approximately 30 healthy
subjects aged 40 or older. Study drugs were administered to
each subject alter being randomly assigned to receive each
of the two treatment regimens in a two-way crossover
fashion as follows:

[0194] Treatment AiAM dosing of one tablet of
PA32540 followed approximately 10 hours later by
clopidogrel 300 mg (Plavix® 300 mg) on Day 1, and
then AM dosing of one tablet of P1562540 followed
approximately 10 hours later by clopidogrel 75 mg
(Plavix® 75 mg) on Days 2-7

[0195] Treatment Biolopidogrel 300 mg (Plavix® 300
mg) +one tablet of EC aspirin 81 mg (Bayer® 81
mg)+one capsule of EC omeprazole 40 mg (Prilosec®
40 mg) dosed concomitantly on Day 1, and clopidogrel
75 mg (Plavix® 75 mg) +one tablet of EC aspirin 81
mg (Bayer® 81 mg) +one capsule of EC omeprazole 40
mg (Prilosec® 40 mg) dosed concomitantly on Days
2-7

The study design consisted of a screening period and two
seven day treatment periods with a washout period of at least
14 days between periods.

[0196] Screening (Days —28 to —l): After informed con-
sent is obtained, subjects underwent assessments to qualify
for study participation. Screening assessments consisting of
a review of inclusion/exclusion criteria, medical history,
ECG, clinical laboratory tests (hematology, chemistry and
urinalysis), urine drug screen, a pregnancy test for women,
physical exam including vitals signs and a review of con-
comitant medications were performed. A blood sample will
be drawn to determine platelet aggregation (>70% for eli-
gibility) and CY P2C19 carrier testing. The assessments did
not necessarily occur on the same day but prior to progress-
ing to the study treatment period. No grapefruit or grapefruit
juice could be ingested within the 10 days prior to dosing or
during the study period.

[0197] Eligible subjects were instructed to abstain from
alcohol consumption during the treatment period Minimal
alcohol consumption (no more than two units per day, on
average, e.g., no more than two bottles of beer or no more
than two glasses of wine) was allowed up until 48 hours
prior to each treatment period. Subjects were also not
allowed to drink any caifeinated beverages, or eat any dark
chocolate for 48 hours prior to the Day 1 blood sample.
Subjects were required to fast 10 hours prior to Day 1 blood
sampling.

[0198] Day 1: Aﬁer at least a 10 hour overnight fast,
concomitant medications were reviewed, adverse events
were reviewed and recorded as appropriate, vital signs were
recorded, and a urine drug screen and a pregnancy test for
women was performed. Blood samples were obtained before
the AM dosing for baseline platelet aggregation assessment
Chronolog (20 M ADP and 2 mM AA used separately as
agonists). Subjects were randomly assigned to receive either
Treatment A or Treatment B in the morning with 240 m1 of
water. Subjects were served a standard breakfast approxi-
mately one hour after dosing and released from the unit.
Subjects on Treatment A returned to the Phase 1 unit in the

Discussion for Study 1

[0184] This is the ﬁrst pharmacodynamic evaluation of the
antiplatelet properties of PA32540, a novel combination
product of 325 mg EC aspirin and 40 mg immediate-release
omeprazole during synchronous and spaced administration
following a clopidogrel loading dose of 300 mg and a
maintenance 75 mg daily dose. The major ﬁndings of the
present study are as follows: (1) a strategy of delayed
administration of clopidogrel by 10 hours with PA32540
therapy attenuates the pharmacodynamic interaction caused
by synchronous administration during loading and mainte-
nance therapy as measured by multiple widely investigated
methods; (2) the antiplatelet response measured after stimu-
lation by arachidonic acid is the same after PA32540 and
enteric coated aspirin administration; and (3) the omepra-
zole-clopidogrel interaction was most revealed by the Veri-
nyow P2Y12 assay and appeared to be most prominent
during maintenance therapy.

[0185] Many studies have attempted to elucidate and
establish the extent of the clinical interaction between clopi-
dogrel and PPls, particularly omeprazole (Gurbel et al.,
2010). These studies have involved retrospective clinical
outcome analyses. The Clopidogrel and the Optimization of
Gastrointestinal Events (COGENT—l) trial is the only pro-
spective randomized investigation that evaluated the clinical
outcomes of patients treated with dual antiplatelet therapy
with or without PPI therapy. In the COGENT—l trial delayed-
release 20 mg omeprazole was combined with 75 mg
clopidogrel in a novel preparation (CGT—2168). COGENT—l
was prematurely terminated after enrollment of 3627 of
5000 planned patients (Siller-Matula et al., 2009). However,
the available data suggested no diﬁerence in ischemic out-
comes between patients treated with CGT—2168+enteric
coated aspirin versus clopidogrel+enteric coated aspirin
(Siller-Matula et all, 2009). Recently, Siller-Matula et al.
performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies
including 152,138 patients, and concluded that co-adrninis-
tration of PPl’s and clopidogrel increased the risk of com-
bined major cardiovascular events by 29% and the risk of

myocardial infarction by 31%.3 However, PPI treatment
decreased the risk of developing gastrointestinal bleeding by
50% (Bhatt et al., 2010).

[0186] Multiple pharmacodynamic studies have evaluated
the PPl-clopidogrel interaction (Gurbel et al., 2010; Angio-
lillo et al., 2011; Ferreiro et all, 2010; G—ilard et al., 2008;
Sibbing et all, 2009; Wiirtz et all, 2010; Giraud et all, 1997).
A reduced platelet inhibition measured by VASP-P in a PCI
population during dual antiplatelet therapy randomly
assigned to synchronous 20 mg daily omeprazole therapy
was ﬁrst reported by Gilard et a1, (2008), In a cross-sectional
observational study of 1,000 patients, consecutive patients
under clopidogrel maintenance treatment and scheduled for
a control coronary angiography, Sibbing et al. (2009) dem-
onstrated that ADP-induced platelet aggregation measured
with multiple electrode platelet aggregometry was signiﬁ-
cantly higher in patients treated with omeprazole (295.5
[1935-5712] AU*min) compared to patients without
omepglazole treatment (2200 [1438-3888] AU*min; p:0,
001).

[0187] Recently, Angiolillo et al. (2011) surmnarized the
dilferential elfects of 80 mg daily omeprazole on the phar-
macodynamjcs of clopidogrel treatment (no aspirin therapy)
(300 mg load/75 mg daily maintenance) in studies of healthy
subjects in the absence of aspirin treatment, During clopi-
dogrel therapy platelet aggregation and PRI signiﬁcantly
increased and IPA decreased irrespective of the timing of
omeprazole administration. A similar study using the more
common 40 mg dose of omeprazole in the absence of aspirin
therapy demonstrated a reduction in antiplatelet effect when
drugs were administered together or separately during the
maintenance phase of treatment, However, platelet reactivity
assessed by light transmittance aggregometry was higher
during omeprazole therapy, but did not reach a threshold of
statistical signiﬁcance.

[0188] The results of previously published studies appear
to be discordant with the attenuation in the interaction that
the inventor observed with spaced administration of
PA32540 and clopidogrel (Angiolillo et all, 2011; Ferreiro et
al., 2010). This discordance may be explained by one or
more of diﬂerences. In the SPACING study, the inventor
selected the more commonly used lower dose of 40 mg

dogrel was given followed immediately by aspirin or
PA32540. Study subjects were provided breakfast and
instructed not to eat until 1 hour after drug administration
Subjects were explicitly instructed by means of a written list
not to consume food or liquids containing caffeine during the
study. Compliance was supervised by study staff After day
6, subjects were conﬁned to the research unit until after day
7 procedures were complete to ensure strict adherence to the
study protocol.

[0168] Blood and Urine Sampling. Urine was analyzed for
cocaine, cannabis, opiates, amphetamines, barbiturates, ben-
zodiazepines and alcohol was determined by breath test at
screening and at check-in on day 1 and on day 6 of each
treatment period. All female subjects of childbearing poten-
tial were given a pregnancy test at screening and at check-in
on day 1 of each period and no randomized subject had a
positive result. Apositive test result for alcohol, illicit drugs,
or pregnancy would exclude the subject from participation
in the study.

[0169] Pre-treatment blood samples were collected after
overnight fast (:10 hrs) and before morning dosing. At 24
hours and 7 days after assigned treatment, blood samples
were collected after an overnight fast and 1 hour after
clopidogrel administration. Blood was collected from the
antecubital vein into Vacutainer® tubes (Becton-Dickinson,
Franklin Lakes, NJ.) after discarding the ﬁrst 2-3 mL of free
ﬂowing blood; the tubes were ﬁlled to capacity and gently
inverted 3 to 5 times to ensure complete mixing of the
anticoagulant. Tubes containing 3.2% trisodium citrate were
used for light transmittance aggregometry and the vasodi-
lator-stimulated phosphoprotein phosphorylation (VASP-P)
assay. In addition, two tubes containing 3.2% sodium citrate
(Greiner Bio-One Vacuette® North America, Inc., Monroe,
NC.) were collected for the Verinyow P2Y12 and ASA
assays.

[0170] Light Transmittance Aggregometry. The blood-
citrate tubes were centrifuged at 120 g for 5 minutes to
recover platelet rich plasma and further centrifuged at 850 g
for 10 minutes to recover platelet poor plasma. The platelet
rich plasma and platelet poor plasma fractions were stored at
room temperature to be used within 30 minutes. Platelet
aggregation was assessed as described previously. Brieﬂy,
platelets were stimulated with 5 and 20 M ADP, and 2 mM
arachidonic acid (AA). Maximal aggregation (PAWX) was
assessed using a Chronolog Lumi-Aggregometer (Model
490-4D) with the Aggrolink software package (Chrono-log
Corp, Havertown, Pa.) (Gurbel et al., 2009).

[0171] Vasodilator Stimulated Phosphoprotein-Phospho-
rylation Assay. The measurement of VASP-P is a method of
quantifying P2Y12 receptor reactivity and reﬂects the extent
of P2Y12 receptor blockade. The platelet reactivity index
(PR1) was calculated after measuring the VASP-P levels
[mean ﬂuorescence intensity (MFI)] determined by mono-
clonal antibodies following stimulation with prostaglandin
(PGEl) (MFIPGEl) and also PGE1+ADP (MFIPGEHADP)
according to the commercially available Biocytex (Biocy-
tex, Inc, Marseille, France) assay. The PRI (%) is calculated
by the equation [(MFIPGEl)—(MFIPGEI—ADP)]/
(MFIPGEI)><100% (Bonello et al., 2008).

[0172] Verinyow-ASA and P2Y12 assay. The Verinyow
assay is a turbidimetric based optical detection system that
measures platelet aggregation in whole blood (Price et al.,
2008; Gurbel et al., 2007). The aspirin cartridge contains a
lyophilized preparation of human ﬁbrinogen-coated beads,

Jan. 31, 2019

arachidonic acid, preservative and buffer. The assay is
designed to measure platelet function based upon the bind-
ing activated platelets to ﬁbrinogen after stimulation. The
instrument measures an optical signal, reported as aspirin
reaction units (ARU). For the P2Y12 assay, ADP is used as
the agonist, and platelet reactivity is reported as P2Y12

reaction units (PRU).

[0173] Endpoints. The primary endpoint measure was
relative inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) at day 7
deﬁned as IPA (%):[(PAD-PA7/PAO]><100 where PA7 was the
maximum 20 M ADP-induced platelet aggregation
(PAmmx) at day 7 and PAD was the maximum 20 pM
ADP-induced platelet aggregation at baseline.

[0174] A secondary endpoint was the IPA at day 7 using
the 2mM AA-induced maximum platelet aggregation
(PA A A). Other endpoints included IPA at day 7 measured by
5 [LM ADP-induced maximum aggregation (PASMX), IPA
from pre-dose to day l post-dose, and relative inhibition of
baseline measurements of PRI, PRU, ARU. The absolute
change from pre-dose to day 1 and from pre—dose to day 7
Post-dose in PAmmx (APAzomx): PASmax (APAsmx), PR1
(APRI), and PRU (APRU), were also calculated.

[0175] Statistical Analysis and Sample Size Calculation.
This study required 30 subjects per treatment arm (15 per
sequence in a crossover fashion). Using 25% one-sided test
and 90% power the sample size was suﬂicient to reject the
null hypothesis that PA32540+C is inferior to ECASA+C at
a non-inferiority margin of 10%. The inventor prespeciﬁed
that ECASA+C would be associated with a mean IPA of
40% at day 7 and a standard deviation of 12%. The sample
size and power calculations were made under the assump-
tion that non-inferiority would be tested with the expectation
that the ditference between ECASA+C and PA32540+C
would be zero. The sample size also provided suﬂicient
power to test the non-inferiority between PA3 2540+C—S and
ECASA+C,

[0176] The primary analysis was to demonstrate the non-
inferiority of PA32540+C or PA32540+C-S compared to
ECASA+C. Non-inferiority was established if the upper
bound of a two-sided 95% conﬁdence interval for the
treatment difference in least square means of IPA (Treatment
A—Treatment B at day 7 or Treatment A—Treatment C at day
7) was 510% IPA.

[0177] Comparisons between ECASA+C versus
PA32540+C for the relative change and the absolute change
from baseline were performed using analysis of variance
(ANOVA) for cross-over design. The ANOVA model
included sequence, period, and treatment as ﬁxed effects,
and subject within sequence as a random effect. The 95%
conﬁdence intervals for the diﬁerence between treatment
least-squares means (LSM) was calculated. The paired t-test
was used to compare the treatment differences between
PA32540+C—S and ECASA+C and also used to compare the
differences between post-treatment timepoints. Statistical
analyses were performed using SAS version 9.1 or higher
(Cary, NC.) and SPSS version 13 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, 111.);
p 0.05 was considered statistically signiﬁcant.

Results for Study 1

[0178] Study Population. Baseline demographics of the
study cohort are shown in Table 1. Thirty healthy volunteers,
with a mean age of 45 and a body mass index of 26 kg/mz,
were enrolled. Subjects were predominantly Caucasian.
Thirty subjects completed the ﬁrst 2 periods of the study,
whereas 28 patients completed the ﬁnal arm of the study.
There were no serious adverse events reported throughout
US 2019/0030008 Al

the study. Treatment-related adverse events were classiﬁed
as ecchymosis (during ECASA+C:10, PA32540+C:9 and
PA32540+C—S:7), gastrointestinal upset (during ECASA+
C:1, PA32540+C:1), headache (during PA32540+C:1),
and epistaxis (during PA32540+C:1).

[0179] Aspirin Eﬁect. There was no diﬁerence in pre-dose
arachidonic acid-induced aggregation and ARUs between
treatments (data not shown). Post-dose arachidonic acid-
induced aggregation was low (3-7%) at l and 7 days after
ECASA+C and PA32540+C dosing. IPA and ARU measure-
ments did not differ between treatments at 24 hour post-
loading and at day 7 (Tables 2 and 3).

[0180] Primary Analysis. Synchronous administration of
PA32540 with clopidogrel failed to meet the non-inferiority
criterion whereas spaced administration met the non-inferi-
ority deﬁnition (upper 95% CI for difference in least squared
means:13.2% IPA vs. 9.6% IPA, respectively (Tables 2 and
3).
[018]] Light Transmittance Aggregometry. A reduced
antiplatelet eﬁect induced by omeprazole was most evident
during maintenance therapy with synchronous PA32540 and
clopidogrel administration (Tables 2 and 3), APASMX and
APAZOmax increased from 1 to 7 days post-dosing (p<0.001
for all treatments (FIGS. 3 and 4). At day 1 post-dose, the
IPAZOMX during PA32540+C—S was marginally higher than
the IPAZOWW during in ECASA+C. However the IPAZDMX
during PA32540+C and theIPAmax during PA32540+C-S
and PA32540+C were lower than ECASA+C (Tables 2 and
3). APAZOMX and APASWDr both increased by spacing clopi-
dogrel therapy in subjects treated with PA32540 (FIGS. 3
and 4).

[0182] The Verinyow-PZYIZ Assay. A similar attenua-
tion in the omeprazole-clopidogrel interaction by drug spac-
ing was observed by Verinyow measurements (Tables 2
and 3; FIG. 5).

[0183] VASP-P assay. Similar to APAmmx and APASMX,
APRI also increased by spacing clopidogrel therapy in
subjects treated with PA32540 (11:0.05 at 1 and 7 days
post-dose, FIG. 6). The attenuation in the clopidogrel-

Jan. 31, 2019

omeprazole interaction by spacing also was evidenced by
examining the differences between groups in relative inhi-
bition of baseline PRI as shown in Tables 2 and 3. At day 1
post-dosing, there was a 5.2% diﬁ'erence between
ECASA+C versus PA32540+C in the relative inhibition of
baseline PRI as compared to a —3.4% diﬁerence between
ECASA+C versus PA32540+C—S. At day 7 the attenuation
of the interaction by spacing also was evident. APR] was
greater at day 7 compared to day l post-dosing in all groups
(p<0.001).

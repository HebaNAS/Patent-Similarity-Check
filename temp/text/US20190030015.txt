[0145] Patients proceed through this dose escalation
scheme until week 5 or until maximum tolerated dose is
attained.

[0146] Throughout the study, patients are evaluated
weekly for drug safety and tolerability during their inpatient
admission and two weeks after treatment for an outpatient
follow-up visit. Dbuing each inpatient admission, patients
remain under close medical monitoring by staff physicians
and nurses. If, at any time during the treatment period, the
staff physician determines that a patient does not tolerate any
given dose, the patient will be considered to have attained
maximum tolerated dose and will not receive any additional
doses of the compound of formula (1). Patients are encour-
aged to contact study staﬁ between study days to report any
adverse experiences

[0147] Patients are observed in the hospital and will not be
discharged until free of all signiﬁcant adverse eﬁects, if any.
Safety assessments, which are performed on study days,
include adverse experiences, monitoring vital signs, stan-
dard safety monitoring. and cardiac monitoring.

[0148] Subjects in Patient Group II show a reducing in
levodopa-associated dyskinesias and motor response ﬂuc-
tuations. The subjects in Patient Group II tolerate the com-
pound of formula (I) at all doses administered. The com-
pound of formula (I) therapy also potentiates the beneﬁcal
effects of levodopa on parkinsonian symptoms.

Example 6

R-SAT Assay

[0149] The functional receptor assay Receptor Selection
and Ampliﬁcation Technology (R-SAT) was used to inves-
tigate the activity of the compound of formula (I) as an
inverse agonist at 5HT2A receptors. The compound of
formula (1) exhibited high potency (pIC50 of 9.1) and high
eﬂicacy (98%) at 5HT2A receptors.

Example 7

Anti-Psychotic Activity Study

[0150] To determine potential in vivo antipsychotic activ-
ity, we studied the compound of formula (I) in an animal
model that predicts such eﬁicacy againist positive symptoms
in humans (FIG. 4). In FIG. 4, ACP refers to the compound
of formula (I). The compound of forlnula (I) did not reduce
hyperactivity induced by 3.0 mg/kg LP of the indirect
dopamine agonist d-amphetamine when administered alone
at doses of 100 mg/kg R0. and below to mice. As expected,
haloperidol dose-dependently reduced amphetamine hyper-
activity with a minimally signiﬁcant effect seen at 0.1
mg/kg, so. When a 10.0 mg/kg PO. dose of the compound

Jan. 31, 2019

of formula (I) was administered in combination with various
s.c. doses of haloperidol, the minimally signiﬁcant dose of
haloperidol was decreased to 0.03 mg/kg. With this combi-
nation, amphetamine hyperactivity is completely reversed.
Thus, an inactive dose ofthe compound of formula (I), when
combined with an inactive dose of haloperidol produces a
complete reversal of amphetamine hyperactivity. This sug-
gests that the antipsychotic activity of haloperidol may be
signiﬁcantly enhanced when it is combined with the com-
pound of formula (I). Equally important, when the com-
pound of formula (I) is combined with haloperdiol, the dose
of haloperidol can be lowered without a loss of eﬂicacy, This
would be expected to improve the safety margin for the
clinical use of haloperidol in neuropsychiatric diseases,

a lOOO-fold greater effect, or at least a 10,000-fold greater
eﬂfect, or at least a 100,000-fold greater etfect, or more than
a 100,000-fold greater eifect. “Selectivity” or “selective,” as
an inverse agonist is understood as a property of the com-
pound of the invention whereby an amount of compound
that effectively inversely agonizes the 5-HT2A receptor, and
thereby decreases its activity, causes little or no inverse
agonistic or antagonistic activity at other, related or unre-
lated, receptors. In particular, in one embodiment, a com-
pound has surprisingly been found not to interact strongly
with other serotonin receptors (5-HT 1A, 1B, 1D, 1E, 1F,
2B, 2C, 4A, 6, and 7) at concentrations where the signaling
of the 5-HT2A receptor is strongly or completely inhibited.
In one embodiment, the compound is also selective with
respect to other monoamine-binding receptors, such as the
dopaminergic, histaminergic, adrenergic and muscarinic
receptors, Compounds that are highly selective for 5-HT2A
receptors may have a beneﬁcial effect in the treatment of
psychosis, schizophrenia or similar neuropsychiatric disor-
ders, while avoiding adverse eﬁects associated with drugs
hitherto suggested for this purpose.

[0036] Some embodiments described herein relate to sero-
tonin 2A or 2C receptor inverse agonists, including compo-
sitions and methods for treating certain side-effects caused
or exacerbated by dopaminergenic agent-associated thera-
pies commonly used in treating neurodegenerative diseases.
For example, the compounds disclosed herein have utility in
reducing dyskinesia and psychosis associated with dopamin-
ergenic therapies used in treating Parkinson’s disease, a
neurodegenerative disease. According to one embodiment,
the compound N—(l-methylpiperidin-4-yl)—N—(4-ﬂourophe-
nylmethyl)-N'-(4-(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl)carb-
amide having the structure of formula (I) is provided:

[0037] One embodiment relates to a composition compris-
ing the compound of formula (I) and a phamiaceutically
acceptable canier. The composition may also contain other
compounds such as compounds for treating dyskensia, dys-
tonia, or psychosis.

[0038] According to one embodiment, the tartrate salt of
the compound, N-(l-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-N-(4-ﬂourophe-
nylmethyl)-N'-(4-(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl)carb-
amide is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable 5-HT2A
receptor inverse agonist. The compound of formula (I) also
possesses lesser potency as a 5-HT2C receptor inverse
agonist and lacks intrinsic activity at the remaining mono-
aminergic receptor subtypes Perhaps most notably, the
compound of formula (I) lacks activity at dopamine receptor
subtypes. (See U .S. patent application Serr No. 9/800,096,
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).
Extensive behavioral pharmacological proﬁling of the com-

pound of formula (I), including pre—clinical models of antip-
sychotic and anti-dyskinetic drug actions, support the thera-
peutic use of the compound in Parkinson’s Disease and
related human neurodegenerative diseases,

[0039] Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a common and pro-
gressive neurodegenerative disease Current estimates sug-
gest that nearly 900,000 individuals in the United States
have PD and that the prevalence is increasing as the US
population ages. Dopamine receptor agonists are used to
alleviate the symptoms of PD, such as motoric dysfunction,
Unfortunately, the protracted use of these dopaminergenic
agents causes, over time, neuropsychiatric (psychosis) and
troublesome motor (dyskinesia)side effects in 30 to 80% of
patients, respectively.

[0040] Antipsychotics and dopamine receptor antagonists
can be effective in ameliorating these adverse effects. Unfor-
tunately, many of these compounds signiﬁcantly worsen
motor function in PD patients secondary to their hypo-
dopaminergic state. Biochemical and pharmacological data
support the hypothesis that potentiation of serotonergic
neurotransmission may be pathophysiolog'ically related to
the development of dyskinesias and psychosis in these
patients. While not being bound by this theory, the com-
pounds disclosed herein were selected to exploit the rela-
tionship of serotonergic activity and the negative side-eﬁects
associated with dopaminergenic therapy.

[0041] L-dopa is a typical dopaminergic compound used
to treat PD, L-dopa has been shown to increase central
serotonin release, turnover, and metabolite concentrations in
rodent brain. Direct acting dopamine receptor agonists like
pergolide possess, in additional to their dopamine receptor
agonist properties, potent agonist activity at serotonin 2A
(5-HT2A) and 2C (S-HTZC) receptors as demonstrated by
various in vitro pharmacological assays.

[0042] In one embodiment, the compounds disclosed
herein can be used to treat many side-effects that arise from
dopaminergenic therapy. For example, the disclosed com-
pounds are also useful for treatment of dyskinesia or psy-
chosis caused or exacerbated as a side-effect of other thera-
peutic agents such as L-dopa. In one embodiment, the
compounds are preferably used for the treatment of dyski-
nesia or psychosis associated with L-dopa treatment

[0043] The compounds may be used to treat existing
dyskinesia or psychosis or may be used prophylactic fashion
when for example, it is considered necessary to initiate
L-dopa therapy and it is feared that dyskinesia or psychosis
may develop,

[0044] The compounds may be used to treat dyskinesia or
psychosis as a monotherapy or as an adjunct to medicaments
to prevent or treat dyskinesia or psychosis side-effects
caused by the medicament or alternatively the compounds
may be given in combination with other compounds which
also reduce dyskinesia.

[0045] In some embodiments, the compounds described
herein can be formulated into compositions for administra-
tion to patients in need thereof. Appropriate compositions
can take a number of diiferent forms depending on how the
composition is to be used. For example, the composition
may be in the form of a powder, tablet, capsule, liquid,
ointment, cream, gel, hydrogel, aerosol. spray, micelle,
liposome or any other pharrnaceutically acceptable form.
One of ordinary skill in the art would readily appreciate that
an appropriate vehicle for use with the disclosed compounds
of the invention should be one that is well tolerated by a
US 2019/0030015 A1

recipient of the composition The vehicle should also readily
enable the delivery of the compounds to appropriate target
receptors. For example, one of ordinary skill in the art would
know to consult Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms and Drug
Delivery Systems, by Ansel, et a1., Lippincott Williams &
Wilkins Publishers; 7th ed. (1999) or a similar text for
guidance regarding such formulations.

[0046] The composition of the invention may be used in a
number ofways. For instance, systemic administration may
be required in which case the disclosed compounds can be
formulated into a composition that can be ingested orally in
the form of a tablet, capsule or liquid. Alternatively the
composition may be administered by injection into the blood
stream. Injections may be intravenous (bolus or infusion) or
subcutaneous (bolus or infusion). The disclosed compounds
can also be administered centrally by means of intracerebral,
intracerebroventricular, or intrathecal delivery.

[0047] The compound may also be used with a time
delayed release device. Such devices may, for example, be
inserted under the skin and the compound may be releasec
over weeks or months. Such a device may be particularly
useful for patients with long term dyskinesia such as patients
on continuous L-dopa therapy for the treatment of PD. The
devices may be particularly advantageous when a compounc
is used which would normally require frequent administra-
tion (e.g., frequent injection).
[0048] It will be readily appreciated that the amount of a
compound required is determined by biological activity anc
bioavailability which in turn depends on the mode of admin-
istration, the physicochemical properties of the compounc
employed and whether the compound is being used as a
monotherapy or in a combined therapy. The frequency 0
administration will also be inﬂuenced by the above men-
tioned factors and particularly the half-life of the compounc
within the subject being treated.

[0049] One of ordinary skill in the art would appreciate
that speciﬁc formulations of compositions and precise thera-
peutic regimes (such as daily doses of the compounds anc
the frequency of administration) can be determined using
known procedures. Such procedures conventionally
employed by the pharmaceutical industry include in vivo
experimentation and clinical trials.

[0050] Generally, a daily dose of between 0.01 rig/kg 0
body weight and 1.0 g/kg of body weight of a serotonin
2A/2C receptor inverse agonist can be used with the meth-
ods disclosed herein. In one embodiment, the daily dose is
between 0.01 mg/kg of body weight and 100 mg/kg of body
weight, or any milligram or half-milligram quantity in this
disclosed range, e.g., 1.5, 2, 25, etc.

[0051] Daily doses may be given as a single administra-
tion (e.g. a daily tablet for oral consumption or as a single
daily injection). Alternatively the compound used may
require administration twice or more times during a day,
depending on the kinetics of the drug associated with the
individual patient. Alternatively a slow release device may
be used to provide optimal doses to a patient without the
need to administer repeated doses.

[0052] Biochemical Evidence

[0053] The cornerstone of current pharmacological inter-
vention in PD remains L-dopa based therapies. L—dopa
readily crosses the blood brain barrier, is taken up by
neurons and undergoes rapid enzymatic conversion to dop-
amine, via L-aromatic acid decarboxylase (LAAD) activity
in dopaminergic neurons. The increased availability and

 

Jan. 31, 2019

release of dopamine from these neurons clearly leads to
increased dopaminergic transmission, and clinical eﬁicacy
in reversing the motoric effects of the hypo-dopaminergic
state observed in PD. However, L-dopa lacks speciﬁcity for
dopaminergic systems, and LAAD is widely expressed in
brain. Early biochemical observations in rat brain noted that
L-dopa substantially reduced central serotonergic stores, and
increased the concentration of the principle serotonin
metabolite of 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) (1).
Histochemical approaches have demonstrated that L-dopa
accumulates in serotonergic neurons, and neurotransmitter
release experiments have demonstrated that L-dopa mark-
edly increased the release of both dopamine and serotonin,
that release of serotonin is dependent upon LAAD activity,
and that it is not eliminated by the selective destruction of
dopaminergic neurons (2,3). These observations suggest that
the administration of L-dopa to PD patients results in
marked increases in the release of central serotonin, poten-
tiating serotonergic neurotransmission. Finally, post-mortem
biochemical analysis of PD patients that developed psycho-
sis, when compared to a matched group that did not develop
neuropsychiatric disturbances, found that the patients with
psychosis had signiﬁcant elevations in serotonin and
5-HIAA levels in multiple cortical and sub-cortical struc-
tures, most notably various mesencephalic nuclei including
the red nucleus (4).

[0054] Serotonin or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) plays a
signiﬁcant role in the functioning of the mammalian body. In
the central nervous system, 5-HT is an important neurotrans-
mitter and neuromodulator that is implicated in such diverse
behaviors and responses as sleeping, eating, locomotion,
perceiving pain, learning and memory, sexual behavior,
controlling body temperature and blood pressure. In the
spinal column, serotonin plays an important role in the
control systems of the aﬁerent peripheral nociceptors
(Moulignier, Rev. Neurol. 15023-15, (1994)). Peripheral
functions in the cardiovascular, hematological, and gastro-
intestinal systems have also been ascribed to 5-HT. 5-HT has
been found to mediate a variety of contractile, secretory, and
electrophysiologic effects including vascular and nonvascu-
lar smooth muscle contraction, and platelet aggregation.
(Fuller, Biology ofSerotonergic Transmission, 1982; Botil-
lin, Serotonin In Mental Abnormalities 1:316 (1978); Bar-
chas, et al., Serotonin and Behavior, (1973)). The 5-HT2A
receptor subtype (also referred to as subclass) is widely yet
discretely expressed in the human brain, including many
conical, limbic, and forebrain regions postulated to be
involved in the modulation of higher cognitive and affective
functions This receptor subtype is also expressed on mature
platelets where it mediates, in part, platelet aggregation, one
of the initial steps in the process of vascular thrombosis.

[0055] Given the broad distribution of serotonin within the
body, it is understandable that tremendous interest in drugs
that aifect serotonergic systems exists (Gershon, et at, The
Peripheral Actions of 5-Hydroxytryptamine, 246 (1989);
Saxena, et at, J. Cardiovascular Pharmacol. 15: Supp. 7
(1990)). Serotonin receptors are members of a large human
gene family of membrane-spanning proteins that function as
transducers of intercellular communication. They exist on
the surface of various cell types, including neurons and
platelets, where, upon their activation by either their endog-
enous ligand serotonin or exogenously administered drugs,
they change their conformational structure and subsequently
interact with downstream mediators of cellular signaling.

Extensive behavioral pharmacological proﬁling of this
agent, including pre-clinical models of antipsychotic and
anti-dyskinetic drug actions support the therapeutic use of
the compound of formula (I) in Parkinson’s Disease and
related human neurodegenerative diseases.

Example 3

Animal Studies

[0134] To determine potential in vivo antipsychotic activ-
ity, we studied the compound of formula (I) in an animal
model that predicts such eﬂicacy in humans. The compound
of formula (I) attenuates hyperactivity induced by the non-
competitive N—methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist
MK-801 (dizocilpine) with a minimum effective dose of 1
mg/kg s.c. (FIG. 2A), and 10 mg/kg po (FIG. 2B). The
compound of formula (I) also reduced spontaneous locomo-
tion at 3 mg/kg and higher s.c, doses (FIG. 2A), and at oral
doses between 10 and 100 mg/kg (FIG, 213), In FIG. 2A and
2B, asterisks indicate statistical signiﬁcance (p<0.05) com-
pared to respective vehicle control Inhibition of MK-801 is
a property shared by most atypical antipsychotic agents, and
aﬁer i.p. administration, the compound of formula (I) attenu-
ated MK-801 hyperactivity at 1 mg/kg, in a manner similar
to the atypical antipsychotic clozapine.

Primate Animal Studies

[0135] To determine the potential in vivo anti-dyskinetic
activity, we studied the compound of formula (I) in an
animal model that predicts such eﬁicacy in humans. The use
of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyrilidine (MPTP)
to induce parkinsonism in monkeys, coupled with prolonged
administration of L-dopa induces severe dyskinesias, The
compound of formula (I), when administered s.c., to dyski-
netic primates was found to signiﬁcantly diminish L-dopa
induced dyskinesias in a dose dependent manner as deter-
mined by the reduction of observable dyskinetic movements
scored as a percentage of those present in placebo injected
animals (FIG. 3).

5HT2A/C Serotonin Antagonist Treatment of
Parkinson’s Disease

[0136] The present example demonstrates that blockage of
5HT2A/C receptors with the compound of formula (I) in
parkinsonian patients reduces levodopa-associated dyskine-
sias and motor response ﬂuctuations. Additionally, the com-
pound of formula (I) is shown to be safe and tolerated at
effective doses and potentiates the beneﬁcial effects of
levodopa on parkinsonian symptoms.

[0137] The compound of formula (I) is administered orally
in a group of 21 parkinsonian patients in a double blind,
placebo controlled study lasting approximately 5 weeks. An
unbalanced parallel-group dose escalation design is used
involving an initial placebo run-in, followed by a random-
ized (active) phase of the compound of formula (I) or
placebo. The compound of formula (I) is administered once
daily for four weeks, with the dose escalating once each
week. Assessments are made on the ﬁrst day of each dose
escalation.

Jan. 31, 2019

[0138] The study is conducted on an outpatient basis.
Studies of the compound of formula (I) etfect on the motor
response to levodopa are conducted in accordance with the
standard Experimental Therapeutics Branch (ETB) para-
digm, which makes use of a steady state infusion of dop-
aminomimetics in order to maximize the reliability of data
acquisition as well as to permit determination of the anti-
parkinsonian efﬁcacy half-time.

[0139] Patients who participate in the study have particu-
lar characteristics. The patients are between 30 and 80 years
of age, inclusively. The patients had been diagnosed with
idiopathic Parkinson’s disease based on the presence of a
characteristic clinical history and neurological ﬁndings. The
patients displayed relatively advanced disease symptoms
with levodopa-associated motor response complications,
including peak-dose dyskinesias and wearing-OH ﬂuctua-
tions.

[0140] The sample size is calculated for the primary
endpoint: the Uniﬁed Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale
(UPDRS) part 111 motor examination. A sample size of 17
provides 80% power to detect predicted differences, a 40%
reduction, with a standardized effect size of 1, using a
two-tailed t-test at the 0.05 signiﬁcance. This assumes an
anti-dyskinetic effect of the compound of formula (I) to be
compared to that of amantadine (as observed in previous
ET B studies), and a linear dose-response of the compound
of formula (I). In this phase 2 study we will accept a
two-sided alpha at a 0.05 signiﬁcance level. Four patients
will be added for the placebo group, totaling 21 subjects
enrolled in the study.

[0141] Patients enter the levodopa infusion optimal rate
determination (dose ﬁnding) portion of the study as soon as
all prohibited medication has been withdrawn for at least
four weeks. If the patient has had an intravenous dosing rate
for levodopa optimized within the past three months, these
doses may be used for the study.

[0142] Intravenous infusion of levodopa is conducted in
an in-patient ward. On the night prior to all infusions,
subjects’ usual anti-parkinsonian medications are withheld
(levodopa by 12 AM, dopamine agonists by 6 PM), During
the ﬁrst and second days of optimal rate determination, two
baseline UPDRS ratings are performed prior to levodopa
infusion, Initially, the “optimal” rate of levodopa infusion is
carefully titrated for each individual to determine the mini-
mum dose needed to achieve a stable “on" state character-
ized by an “optimal” reduction in parkinsonian signs and
mild but ratable dyskinesias (comparable to patient’s usual

on” state). Dyskinesia severity is similar to that experi-
enced with each patient’s usual therapeutic regimen.
Levodopa will be administered by means of an indwelling
intravenous catheter, The initial infusion rate of levodopa
will not exceed 80 mg/hr. Subsequent infusion rates may be
gradually increased until the optimal rate is found, up to a
maximum of 2 mg/kg/hour.

[0143] Levodopa infusions will ordinarily last up to 8
hours, but may be continued uninterrupted for several days
or be repeated on other days to obtain reliable assessment of
motor function, The peripheral decarboxylase inhibitor car-
bidopa (50 mg, given every 3 hours) is administered orally
starting at least one hour prior to intravenous administration
of levodopa and continuing until levodopa effects have worn
of. After the initial “optimal” rate ﬁnding for levodopa
infusion, all subsequent infusions are given at the predeter-
mined “optimal rate”. As an intravenous levodopa formula-

tors, was demonstrated by the application of radioligand
binding techniques (8). The methodologies used to docu-
ment this cannot deﬁne the nature of the interaction between
an anti-psychotic antipsychotic and a given receptor For
example, the methods are unable to distinguish as to whether
a drug possesses positive (agonist) or negative (inverse
agonist) intrinsic activity, or if it lacks intrinsic activity and
functions as a neutral antagonist. Recently, this class of
drugs was proﬁled using a functional assay that can dis-
criminate the mechanistic nature of a drug-target interaction
(9}

[0127] This approach revealed a number of novel aspects
of antipsychotic dmg action (See US, Pat. No, 6,358,698,
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety). It
conﬁrmed that these drugs as a class possess potent neutral
antagonistic activity at the D2 receptor, lmportantly, it also
revealed that nearly all antipsychotic dnigs, with the excep-
tion of the substituted benzamides, possess potent negative
intrinsic activity (inverse agonism) at the 5HT2A receptor
These efforts have identiﬁed inverse agonist activity at the
5HT2A receptor as being a critical molecular component of
anti-psychotic drug action, and suggest that compounds that
are selective 5HT2A receptor inverse agonists may have
antipsychotic eﬂicacy, even in the absence of D2 receptor
activity,

[0128] None of the older typical antipsychotics, exempli-
ﬁed by haloperidol, can be administered to PD patients
because of severe worsening in their motor states. The more
recent development of newer atypical agents, namely those
with reduced (but clearly not absent) liability to induced
motoric side elfects, suggested that perhaps these agents
could be used in PD patients to control dyskinesias and
hallucinosis. Unfortunately, the majority of these agents are
not tolerated in PD patients secondary to worsening of motor
function (10). Of the atypical agents, only one, clozapine,
has shown efﬁcacy in treating these adverse treatment-
induced side eﬁects in PD patients without untoward
motoric liabilities. As such, an improved understanding of
the in vitro molecular proﬁle of clozapine can provide
critical insights into the design of novel agents for these
difﬁcult to treat indications

[0129] The demonstration that clozapine is tolerated in PD
patients comes from studies on treatment-induced psychosis.
Two well-designed placebo controlled, double blind clinical
trials have shown that clozapine is efﬁcacious in psychotic
PD patients, and does not worsen parkinsonism, at doses in
the 25-35 mg/day range (11,12). Similarly, two open label
studies of clozapine in L-dopa and apomorphine induced
dyskinesias also demonstrate eﬁicacy and tolerability of low
doses of clozapine, on the order of 50-100 mgs/day in these
patients (13,14). The dosages used in these PD patients are
much lower than the typical 600-900 mg/day range of doses
used in treatment refractory schizophrenia. Commensurate
with this lower dosing, plasma levels of clozapine in PD
patients with psychosis ranged from 4.5 to 16.1 ng/ml (15).
This is dramatically lower than the 250 ng/ml average serum
levels that are associated with therapeutic response in refrac-
tory schizophrenic patients.

[0130] Not surprisingly, the administration of low dose
clozapine, and the commensurate plasma levels obtained at
these doses, are well below those necessary for D2 receptor
occupancy, providing a mechanistic understanding of why
these dosages are tolerated with respect to motoric liability
in these patients. (Positron emission tomography (PET)

Jan. 31, 2019

studies in schimphrenic patients have deﬁned steady state
plasma concentrations of clozapine that are required to
generate high occupancy of striatal dopamine D2 receptors).
These data also argue that eﬂicacy in dyskinesia and psy-
chosis is mediated by one or more of the non-D2 receptor
targets of this drug. Since rank orders of receptor potencies,
as determined by in vitro pharmacological assays, has
repeatedly been shown to be a reliable predictor of in vivo
receptor action, the receptor sites for which clozapine dis-
play a higher potency than D2 receptors would be predicted
to potentially mediate its clinical eﬂicacy in this indication,
Detailed functional proﬁling of clozapine against over 30 of
the known monoaminergic receptor subtypes has identiﬁed
only ﬁve sites with higher afﬁnity than dopamine D2 recep-
tors, histamine Hi, muscarinic ml and m4, and serotonin 2A,
2B, and 6 receptors, Table 2 reports the absolute and relative
potencies of clozapine at some of these monoamine receptor
targets as determined by the physiologically predictive in
vitro R-SAT assay. These data suggest that at the clinical
dosing and serum levels of clozapine observed in PD, two
receptor sites are preferentially occupied, the histamine H1
and 5HT2A receptors.

[0131] Conversely, plasma levels achieved with 50 mgs/
day of clozapine result in full occupancy of cortical 5HT2A
receptors, and extrapolation to the plasma levels observed in
PD patients treated for psychosis suggest near complete
occupancy of 5HT2Areceptors at these dosages as well (16).
Whereas central occupancy of 5HT2A receptors, coupled
with negative intrinsic activity, may mediate eﬁicacy in
these states, central occupancy of histamine Hi receptors is
known to cause sedation, an elfect that was observed in the
majority of PD patients treated with low dose clozapine,
Taken together these data suggest that clozapine is acting
primarily as a 5HT2A receptor inverse agonist in this
clinical setting.

Behavioral Pharmacological Evidence

[0133] The tar’trate salt of the compound, N-(l-methylpi-
peridin-4-yl)-N-(4-ﬂourophenylmethyl)-N‘-(4-(2-methyl-

propyloxy)phenylmethyl)carbamide (compound of formula
(1)), is a potent, selective, orally bioavailable 5HT2A recep-
tor inverse agonist, The compound of formula (I) also
possesses lesser potency as a 5-HT2C receptor inverse
agonist and lacks intrinsic activity at the remaining mono-
aminergic receptor subtypes. Perhaps most notably, the
compound of formula (I) lacks activity at dopamine receptor
subtypes. (See US. patent application Ser. No. 9/800,096,
which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety).
US 2019/0030015 A1

effects associated with interactions with non-efﬁcacy off-
target receptor interaction. For example many antipsychotic
drugs possess high aﬁinity interactions with H] receptors,
H1 antagonism is associated with sedation, Further, other
antipsuchotic drugs have aﬂinity interactions with alpha
receptors. Antagonism of alpha-l receptors is associated
with orthostasis, Improvements in therapeutic efﬁcacy and
safety also can be achieved by combining two or more
agents each with selective target interactions to achieve
additive or synergistic beneﬁts Speciﬁcally, by combining
one drug that speciﬁcally interacts with D2 receptors as an
antagonist and another drug like the compound of formula
(I) that interacts with speciﬁcally with 5-I’IT2A/2C receptors
as antagonist or inverse agonist, the multitude of off-target
interactions of existing antipsychotic drugs can be avoided,

[0105] In one embodiment, serotonin 2A and/or 2C recep-
tor inverse agonists are used to treat a variety of human
neuropsychiatric diseases including schizophrenia, schizo-
affective disorders, mania, behavioral disturbances associ-
ated with dementia and psychotic depression For example,
the compounds disclosed herein have utility in reducing the
positive symptoms, improving negative symptoms and
enhancing cognitive function in patients with certain neu-
ropsychiatric diseases,

[0106] Antipsychotics and dopamine receptor antagonists
can be effective in ameliorating positive symptoms in
schizophrenia and related diseases. Unfortunately, many of
these compounds signiﬁcantly worsen motor function and
increase negative symptoms or leave these and other symp-
toms untreated in these patients, Biochemical and pharma-
cological data support the hypothesis that potentiation of
serotonergic neurotransmission may be pathophysiologi-
cal ly important in the development of these unwanted etfects
and conversely blockade of serotonergic neurotransmission
may reduced the side-effects associated with antipsychotic
drug therapy. While not being bound by this theory, the
compound of formula (I) was selected to exploit the rela-
tionship of serotonergic activity and the limiting effects
associated with antipsychotic therapy.

[0107] Haloperidol is a typical antipsychotic with speci-
ﬁcity as a D2 receptor antagonist, This compound com-
monly is used to treat the positive symptoms associated with
acute exacerbations of schizophrenia, Unfortunately, the use
of this compound is associated with a plethora of unwanted
niotoric side effects, including akathisia, parkinsonism, tar-
dive dyskinesia and neuroleptic maliginant syndrome, This
compound also does not alter or worsens negative symptoms
and cognitive function in these patients.

[0108] In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I)
can be used to treat many side-eifects that arise from
antipsychotic therapy. For example, the compound of for-
mula (I) may be useful for treatment of motoric side-effects
of other antipsychotic agents such as haloperidol. In one
embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is used for the
treatment of motoric side-eﬁects associated with haloperidol
treatment,

[0109] In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I)
may be used prophylactically when for example, it is con-
sidered necessary to initiate haloperidol therapy and it is
feared that motoric deﬁcits may develop.

[0110] In some embodiments, the compound of formula
(I) may be used to treat psychosis as a monotherapy or as an
adjunct to medicaments to prevent or treat antipsychotic
drug side-eifects caused by the medicament, Alternatively,

Jan. 3], 2019

the compound of formula (I) may be given in combination
with other compounds, which also reduce antipsychotic drug
side-effects.

[0111] In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I)
may used to treat the negative symptoms of certain neurop-
sychiatric disease including schizophrenia as a monotherapy
or as an adjunct to medicaments used to treat the positive
symptom of these diseases

[0112] In some embodiments, the compound of formula
(I) also may used to improve cognitive function in certain
neuropsychiatric disease including schizophrenia as a mono-
therapy or as an adjunct to medicaments used to treat the
positive symptom of these diseases,

[0113] The compound of formula (I) may be synthesized

(57) ABSTRACT

Behavioral pharmacological data with the compound of
formula (I), a novel and selective 5HT2A/2C receptor
inverse agonist, demonstrate in vivo eﬂicacy in models of
psychosis and dyskinesias. This includes activity in revers-
ing MK-801 induced locomotor behaviors, suggesting that
this compound may be an efﬁcacious anti-psychotic, and
activity in an MPTP primate model of dyskinesias, suggest-
ing efﬁcacy as an anti-dyskinesia agent. These data support
the hypothesis that 5HT2A/2C receptor inverse agonism
may confer antipsychotic and anti-dyskinetic efﬁcacy in
humans, and indicate a use of the compound of formula (I)
and related agents as novel therapeutics for Parkinson’s
Disease, related human neurodegenerative diseases, and

[0096] The pharmacological properties and the selectivity
of the compound of formula (I) for speciﬁc serotonergic
receptor subtypes may be demonstrated by a number of
different assay methods using recombinant receptor sub-
types, preferably of the human receptors if these are avail-
able, e.g. conventional second messenger or binding assays.
A particularly convenient functional assay system is the
receptor selection and ampliﬁcation assay disclosed in U .8.
Pat. No. 5,707,798, which describes a method of screening
for bioactive compounds by utilizing the ability of cells
transfected with receptor DNA, e.g., coding for the different
serotonergic subtypes, to amplify in the presence of a ligand
of the receptor. Cell ampliﬁcation is detected as increased
levels of a marker also expressed by the cells.

Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Disorders

[0097] In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I)
and related serotonin 2A and/ or 2C receptor inverse ago-
nists alone or in combination with other antipsychotic drugs,
particularly those with dopamine antagonist properties, are
used to treat a variety of human neuropsychiatric diseases
including schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorders, mania
and psychotic depression. Speciﬁcally. the compound of
formula (I) and related serotonin 2A/2C receptor inverse
agonists can improve psychotic symptoms (feelings of being
controlled by outside forces, hearing, seeing, smelling or
feeling things which are not there, hallucinations and
unusual beliefs, delusions), negative symptoms (loss of
normal behavior including tiredness, loss of concentration
and lack of energy and motivation, and cognitive function in
psychotic patients when used alone or in combination with
other antipsychotic drugs. These agents also reduce the
side-effects associated with the use of existing antipsychotic
drugs and reduce the dose of exisiting agent that is required
to achieve antipsychotic eﬂicacy. Speciﬁcally, the compound
of formula (I) and related compounds alone or in combina-
tion with existing antipsychotic drugs can be used to control
the behavioral and neuropsychiatric manifestations present
in all of these disease states. In some embodiments, phar-
maceutical compositions comprised of a combination of the
compound of formula (I) and existing antipsychotic agents
are used.

[0098] Neuropsychiatric disorders associated with psy-
chosis affect a large proportion of the human population.
Psychosis appears as a dominating symptom in diverse
disorders, including schizophrenia, schizoaﬂective states,
mania, psychotic depression among others, Current treat-
ment options primarily involve pharmacotherapy with a
class of drugs known as antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are
effective in ameliorating positive symptomotology of these
disorders, yet they frequently do not improve and may
worsen negative and cognitive symptoms. Signitifcant treat-
ment limiting side effects are common with the use of
antipsychotic drugs.

[0099] Drugs that possess antipsychotic properties have
been in clinical use since the early 1950’s. Antipsychotic
drugs are widely prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms

Jan. 31, 2019

irrespective of their etiology. Clinical use of these com-
pounds is limited, however, by their side elfect proﬁles.
Nearly all of the “typical” or ﬁrst generation compounds
have signiﬁcant adverse effects on human motor function,
These “extrapyramidal” side effects, so termed due to their
effects on human motor systems, can be both acute and
chronic in nature. Acute elfects include dystonic reactions,
and a potentially life threatening but rare symptom constel-
lation; neuroleptic malignant syndrome. Chronic side effects
include akathisias, tremors, and tardive dyskinesia. Due in
large part to these disabling side eﬁ'ects, antipsychotic drug
development has been focused on newer “atypical” agents
(clozapine, olanzapine, quetiapine, risperidal, arapiprazole)
that appear to have reduced liability for inducing adverse
motoric effects. These newer “atypical” antipsychotic drugs,
however, suffer from other limiting side-effects, including
induction of cardiovascular abnormalities, extreme sedation,
morbid obesity, type II diabetes, blood dyscrasias and pan-
creatitis among others.

[0100] While the precise molecular mechanisms mediat-
ing antipsychotic drug action remain to be elucidated, antip-
sychotic drugs have been shown, by both in vitro and in vivo
methods, to interact with a large number of central mono-
aminergic neurotransmitter receptors, including dopaminer-
gic, serotonergic, adrenergic, muscarinic, and histaminergic
receptors. It is likely that the therapeutic and adverse effects
of these drugs are separable and are mediated by distinct
receptor subtypes.

[0101] Currently, it is thought that antipsychotic drugs
reduce the positive symptoms in these disorders by blocking
dopamine D2 receptors. This is based on the observation that
these all antipsychotic drugs have reasonable afﬁnity for this
receptor in vitro, and that a correlation exists between their
potency to block D2 receptors and their ability to reduce the
psotive symptoms of these disorders. Unfortunately, it is
likely that antagonism of dopamine D2 receptors also medi-
ates the disabling exu'apyramidal side effects.

[0102] The only other consistent receptor interaction that
these drugs as a class display is inverse agonism of 5-HT2A
receptors, suggesting that inverse agonism of these receptors
is an alternate molecular mechanism that confers antipsy-
chotic efﬁcacy. This theory is bolstered by a number of basic
scientiﬁc and clinical observations regarding serotonergic
systems and the 5-HT2A receptor in particular (US 6,358,
698 incorporated by reference).

[0103] However, nearly all known antipsychotic agents
lack speciﬁcity in their mechanisms of action. In addition to
possessing activity at dopamine D2 receptors and 5-HT2A
receptors, these drugs as a class have a multitude of phar-
macologically relevant interactions with critical neuronal
proteins including a host of cell surface receptors, ion
channels, and re-uptake transporters. This lack of drug target
speciﬁcity likely contributes to the multiplicity of adverse
effects associated with use of existing antipsychotic agents.

[0104] These observations highlight the need to develop
novel therapeutic regimens that are speciﬁcally designed to
not only demonstrate eﬂicacy against these particular dis-
abling symptoms but to also possess tolerability in these
speciﬁc patient populations. This can be achieved by
improving the selectivity of the drug target interactions of
new therapeutic agents. Speciﬁcally, the development of
agents with novel mechanisms of action that avoid the
known pitfalls associated with existing agents is desired. In
addition, improved selectivity avoids the known adverse

EXAMPLES

[0120] The examples below are non-limiting and are set
forth to illustrate some of the embodiments disclosed herein.

Example 1

Agonist Studies

[0121] Parkinson's disease is typically managed using
direct acting dopamine agonists. Examples of this class of
compounds include pergolide, bromocriptine, pramipexole
and ropinirole. These drugs are thought to be effective
because of their agonist activity at the dopamine D2, D3, and
D4 receptors located in striatal and forebrain regions. This
activity may compensate for the progressive loss of fore-
brain dopaminergic innervation that characterizes the PD.
However, these drugs are not speciﬁc for these dopaminergic
receptors and also possess potent agonist activity at other
receptors, including 5HT2A and 5HT2C receptors, Using a
physiologically predictive in vitro functional assay, it is
shown below that pergolide, lisuride, and bromocriptine
display agonist potencies at human 5HT2Areceptors that are
equivalent to those observed at the human D2 receptor.
(FIGSt 1A-1B, and Table 1)

[0122] Using the R-SAT assay, the activity of common
dopeaminergic compounds against dopamine and serotonin
receptor types was studied. (See US. Pat. Nos. 5,912,132
and 5,955,281, both of which are hereby incorporated by
reference.) In FIGS. 1A-lB, data were plotted as percentage
agonist response as determined for a reference full agonist
(100%) versus drug concentration. The reference full ago-
nist used for the D2 receptor was quinpirole, while serotonin
was used for the 5HT2Areceptor Compounds tested include
dopamine (ﬁlled squares), quinpirole (ﬁlled circles), lisuride
(ﬁlled triangles), bromocriptine (ﬁlled diamonds), serotonin
(open squares), and pergolide (ﬁlled inverted triangles),
Potencies of representative dose response curves using dop-
amine D2 receptors were determined and are shown in FIG.
1A; (pergolide-0.21 nM, dopamine-8.0 nM, 1isuride-0.023
nM, quinpirole-3.3 nM, bromocriptine-0.43 nM, and sero-
tonin-no response). FIG, 1B shows compound potency
against the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor; (dopamine-no
response, quinpirole-174 nM, 1isuride-0.028 nM, bro-
mocriptine-2.7 nM, serotonin-33 nM, and pergolide-0.22
nM).

[0123] Because these drugs are administered in the clinic
to achieve D2 receptor occupancy, these data argue that
direct acting dopamine agonists are also behaving as 5HT2A
receptor agonists in vivo when administered in therapeutic
doses to PD patients.

[0124] Data are derived from R-SAT assays. As shown, all
compounds displayed full (>75%) relative agonist eﬂicacies.
Data are reported as iLog (ECSO) values +/— standard
deviation of three to eight separate determinations. The
VGV isoform of the 5HT2C receptor, and the short form of
the D2 receptor were utilized for these studies. NA denotes
no activity, NT denotes not tested.

[0125] The agonist activity of these anti-parkinsonian
agents at human 5HT2A/C receptors has particular impli-
cations for the generation and treatment of human halluci-
nations and psychosis. That certain natural and synthetic
chemical compounds can induce hallucinatory states in
humans has led to detailed investigations of the mechanisms
of action of these hallucinogenic or psychotomimetic drugs.
These efforts have implicated a number of molecular activi-
ties of these classes of drugs as being relevant to their ability
to induce hallucinations, particularly visual hallucinations,
in normal healthy individuals. Hallucinogens fall into two
distinct chemical classes, the phenylethanolamines, and the
substituted tryptamines, both of which are structurally
related to serotonin. Many in vitro studies, utilizing radio-
ligand binding techniques, as well as functional pharmaco-
logical assays, have repeatedly demonstrated that these
drugs are potent 5HT2A and 5HT2C receptor agonists (5).
More recent in vivo studies, in which normal volunteers are
administered the hallucinogen MDMA (Ecstasy) and then
evaluated for clinical response, as well as anatomical mea-
sures of brain activation utilizing functional neuro-imaging
technologies, have demonstrated that the psychometric and
pharmacological activities of hallucinogens can be blocked
by anti-psychotic drugs as well as the compound ketanserin
(6,7). These drugs share a common molecular property,
5HT2A receptor inverse agonism.

Example 2

Inverse Agonist Studies

[0126] Once treatment-induced motoric and neuropsychi-
atric symptoms develop in PD patients, few viable thera-
peutic options exist to manage these disturbances. Treatment
strategies ditfer for these two classes of symptoms, but one
uniformly clinically eﬂicacious, yet poorly tolerated
approach, involves the use of antipsychotic agents. Antip-
sychotics are known to possess high afﬁnity for the dop-
amine D2 subclass of dopamine receptors and neutral
antagonism of these receptors underlie the therapeutic eﬁi-
cacy of these drugs in human psychosis. In addition to
dopamine D2 receptor antagonism, these agents possess a
wide range of additional potent and pharmacologically rel-
evant activities at many of the other monoaminergic receptor
subtypes including serotonin, adrenergic, muscarinic and
histaminergic receptors. Of these additional molecular
actions, 5HT2A receptor interactions have been the subject
of signiﬁcant study. That antipsychotics have high aﬂinity
for multiple receptor subtypes, including serotonin 2 recep-

formula (I). The method comprises administering to a sub-
ject an effective amount of the compound; identifying a
responsive subject having an ameliorated disease condition
associated with a monamine receptor; and identifying a
genetic polymorphism in the responsive subject, wherein the
genetic polymorphism predisposes a subject to being
responsive to the compound It is anticipated that this
method may be useful both for predicting which individuals
are responsive to therapeutic effects of the compound and
also for predicting those likely to experience adverse side
effect responses This approach may be useful for identify-
ing, for example, polymorphisms in a serotonin receptor that
lead to constitutive activation and are thus amenable to
inverse agonist therapy. In addition, this method may be
useful for identifying polymorphisms that lead to altered
drug metabolism whereby toxic byproducts are generated in
the body. Such a mechanism has been implicated in the rare,
but potentially life threatening side effects of the atypical
antipsychotic, clozapine.

[0087] In a related embodiment, a method for identifying
a subject suitable for treatment with the compound of
formula (I) is provided. According to the method, the
presence of a polymorphism that predisposes the subject to
being responsive to the compound is detected, the presence
of the polymorphism indicating that the subject is suitable
for treatment. Also provided are kits for performing the
same.

[0088] The compound of formula (I) preferably shows
selective inverse agonist activity towards the 5-HT2A recep-
tor. Such activity is deﬁned by an ability of the ligand to
attenuate or abolish the constitutive signaling activity of this
receptor. Selectivity in the present context is understood as
a property of a compound of the invention whereby an
amount of compound that effectively inversely agonizes the
5-HT2A receptor and thereby decreases its activity causes
little or no inverse agonistic or antagonistic activity at other,
related or unrelated, receptors. In particular, the compound
of formula (I) has surprisingly been found not to interact
strongly with other serotonin receptors (5-HT 1A, 1B, ID,
IE, IF, 2B, 2C, 4A, 6, and 7) at concentrations where the
signaling of the 5-HT2A receptor is strongly or completely
inhibited In one embodiment, the compound is also selec-
tive with respect to other monoamine-binding receptors,
such as the dopaminergic, histaminergic, adrenergic and
niuscarinic receptors.

[0089] One embodiment of the present invention relates to
a method of alleviating or treating a disease condition in
which modiﬁcation of monoamine receptor activity, in par-
ticular 5-HT2A serotonergic receptor activity, has a beneﬁ-
cial effect by administering a therapeutically effective
amount of the compound of formula (I) to a subject in need
of such treatment. Such diseases or conditions may, for
instance arise from inappropriate stimulation or activation of
serotonergic receptors. It is anticipated that by using a
compound that is selective for a particular serotonin receptor
subtype, in particular 5—HT2A, the problems with adverse
side effects observed with the known antipsychotic drugs,
such as extrapyramidal effects, may be avoided substan-
tially.

[0090] The term “therapeutically effective amount” as
used herein means an amount of an active compound or
pharmaceutical agent that elicits the biological or medicinal
response in a tissue, system, animal or human that is being
sought by a researcher, veterinarian. medical doctor or other

10

clinician, which includes alleviation, amelioration, or less-
ening of the symptoms of the disease being treated, or
prevents or slows the progress of the disease or increase of
the symptoms.

[0091] In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I)
may be administered in a single daily dose, or the total daily
dosage may be administered in divided doses, for example,
two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, the compound of
formula (I) may be administered in intranasal form via
topical use of suitable intranasal vehicles, via transdermal
routes, using those forms of transdermal skin patches well
known to persons skilled in the art, by implantable pumps;
or by any other suitable means of administration. To be
administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system,
for example, the dosage administration will, of course, be
continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage
regimen.

[0092] The dosage regimen utilizing the compound of
formula (I) is selected in accordance with a variety of factors
including type, species, age, weight, sex and medical con-
dition of the patient; the severity of the condition to be
treated; the route of administration; the renal and hepatic
function of the patient; and the particular compound
employed. A physician or veterinarian of ordinary skill can
readily determine and prescribe the effective amount of the
drug required to prevent, counter or arrest the progress of the
disease or disorder that is being treated.

[0093] For oral administration, compositions containing
the compound of formula (I) are preferably provided in the
form oftablets containing 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 5.0,
10.0, 15.0, 25.0 or 50.0 mg of the active ingredient for the
symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be
treated. In one embodiment, a unit dose contains from about
0.001 mg to about 50 mg of the active ingredient. In another
embodiment a unit dose contains from about 1 mg to about
10 mg of active ingredient.

[0094] The compound of formula (I) may be used alone at
appropriate dosages deﬁned by routine testing in order to
obtain optimal pharmacological effect on a monoaminergic
receptor, in particular the S-HTZA serotonergic receptor
subtype, while minimizing any potential toxic or otherwise
unwanted effects. In addition, co-administration or sequen-
tial administration of other agents that improve the effect of
the compound may, in some cases, be desirable.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS

Deﬁnitions

[0028] For the purpose of the current disclosure, the
following deﬁnitions shall in their entireties be used to
deﬁne technical terms, and shall also, in their entireties, be

Jan. 31, 2019

used to deﬁne the scope of the composition of matter for
which protection is sought in the claims.

[0029] “Constitutive activity” is deﬁned as the elevated
basal activity of a receptor that is independent of the
presence of an agonist. Constitutive activity of a receptor
may be measured using a number of different methods,
including cellular (e.g., membrane) preparations (see, e.g.,
Barr &. Manning, .1. Biol. Chem. 272:32979-87 (1997)),
puriﬁed reconstituted receptors with, or without the associ-
ated G-protein in phospholipid vesicles (Cerione et al.,
Biochemistry 23:4519-25 (1984)) and functional cellular
assays (US. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/103,317) or any
other method known in the art.

[0030] “Agonist” is deﬁned as a compound that increases
the basal activity of a receptor when it contacts the receptor.
[0031] An “antagonist” is deﬁned as a compound that
competes with an agonist or inverse agonist for binding to a
receptor, thereby blocking the action of an agonist or inverse
agonist on the receptor However, an antagonist (also known
as a “neutral” antagonist) has no effect on constitutive
receptor activity.

[0032] An “inverse agonist” is deﬁned as a compound that
decreases the basal activity of a receptor (i.e., signaling
mediated by the receptor). Such compounds are also known
as negative antagonists. An inverse agonist is a ligand for a
receptor that causes the receptor to adopt an inactive state
relative to a basal state occurring in the absence of any
ligand. Thus, while an antagonist can inhibit the activity of
an agonist, an inverse agonist is a ligand that can alter the
conformation of the receptor in the absence of an agonist.
The concept of an inverse agonist has been explored by
Bond et al. in Nature 3742272 (1995). More speciﬁcally,
Bond et al. have proposed that unliganded [SZ-adrenoceptor
exists in an equilibrium between an inactive conformation
and a spontaneously active conformation Agonists are pro-
posed to stabilize the receptor in an active conformation.
Conversely, inverse agonists are believed to stabilize an
inactive receptor conformation. Thus, while an antagonist
manifests its activity by virtue of inhibiting an agonist, an
inverse agonist can additionally manifest its activity in the
absence of an agonist by inhibiting the spontaneous conver-
sion of an unliganded receptor to an active conformation.

[0033] The “5-HT2A receptor” is deﬁned as a receptor,
having an activity corresponding to the activity of the human
serotonin receptor subtype, which was characterized through
molecular cloning and pharmacology as detailed in Saltz-
man et al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 181: 1469-78; and
Julius et al., Prnc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 872928-932, the
disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in
their entireties.

[0034] The term “subject” refers to an animal, preferably
a mammal, most preferably a human, who is the object of
treatment, observation or experiment.

[0035] “Selective” is deﬁned as a property of a compound
whereby an amount of the compound sufﬁcient to effect a
desired response from a particular receptor type, subtype,
class or subclass with signiﬁcantly less or substantially little
or no effect upon the activity other receptor types. For
example, a selective compound may have at least a 10-fold
greater effect on activity of the desired receptor than on other
receptor types. In some cases, a selective compound may
have at least a 20-fold greater effect on activity of the desired
receptor than on other receptor types, or at least a 50-fold
greater effect, or at least a 100-fold greater effect, or at least

[0021] Additionally disclosed herein is a method of inhib-
iting an activity of a monoamine receptor comprising con-
tacting the monoamine receptor or a system containing the
monoamine receptor with an amount of the compound of
formula (I) that is eﬁective in inhibiting the activity of the
monoamine receptor. In some embodiments, the monoamine
receptor is a serotonin receptor. In one embodiment the
serotonin receptor is the 5-HT2A subclass. In some embodi-
ments the serotonin receptor is in the central nervous system.
In some embodiments the serotonin receptor is in the

activation.

[0022] Also disclosed herein is a method of inhibiting an
activation of a monoamine receptor comprising contacting

US 2019/0030015 A1

[0076] In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is
selective for 5-HT class serotonin receptors, such as the
5-HT2A subclass of serotonin receptors. In another embodi-
ment, the compound has little or substantially no anti-
dopaminergic activity.

[0077] One embodiment provides methods of treating a
disease condition associated with a monoamine receptor
comprising administering to a mammal in need of such
treatment an effective amount of the compound of formula
(1). One embodiment provides methods for treating or
alleviating disease conditions associated with improper
function or stimulation of native, as well as mutated or
otherwise modiﬁed, forms of central serotonin receptors,
particularly the 5-HT class of such receptors, comprising
administration of an effective amount of a selective inverse
agonist of formula (I) to a host in need of such treatment.
Also provided are kits for performing the same.

[0078] In one embodiment, the receptor is the 5-HT2A
subclass. In one embodiment, the disease condition is asso-
ciated with dysfunction of the serotonin receptor. In another
embodiment, the disease condition is associated with acti-
vation of the serotonin receptor, for instance, inappropriately

using the compound of formula (I) is useful include, but are
not limited to, neuropsychiatric diseases such as schizophre-
nia and related idiopathic psychoses, anxiety, sleep disor-
ders, appetite disorders, aﬁective disorders such as major
depression, bipolar disorder, and depression with psychotic
features, and Tourette’s Syndrome, drug-induced psychoses,
psychoses secondary to neurodegenerative disorders such as
Alzheimer’s or Huntington’s Disease. It is anticipated that
the compound of formula (I), a particularly selective inverse
agonist of 5-HT2A that shows little or no activity on
dopaminergic receptors, may be especially useful for treat-
ing schizophrenia. Treatment using the compound of for-
mula (I) may also be useful in treating migraine, vasospasm,
hypertension, various thrombotic conditions including myo-
cardial infarction, thrombotic or ischemic stroke, idiopathic
and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, and peripheral
vascular disease.

[0081] Some embodiments also pertain to the ﬁeld of
predictive medicine in which pharmacogenomics is used for
prognostic (predictive) purposes. Pharmacogenomics deals
with clinically signiﬁcant hereditary variations in the
response to dntgs due to altered drug disposition and abnor-
mal action in aﬁected persons. See e.g., Eichelbaum, Clin
Exp Pharmacol. Physiol., 23:983-985 (1996), and Linder,

Jan. 3], 2019

Clin. Chem. 431254-66 (1997). In general, two types of
pharmacogenetic conditions can be diﬁerentiated: genetic
conditions transmitted as a single factor altering the way
drugs act on the body (altered drug action), and genetic
conditions transmitted as single factors altering the way the
body acts on drugs (altered drug metabolism). These phar-
macogenetic conditions can occur as naturally occurring
polymorphisms

[0082] One pharmacogenomics approach to identifying
genes that predict dntg response, known as “a genome-wide
association,” relies primarily on a high-resolution map of the
human genome consisting of already known gene-related
markers (e.g., a “bi-allelic” gene marker map that consists of
60,000-100,000 polymorphic or variable sites on the human
genome, each of which has two variants). Such a high-
resolution genetic map can be compared to a map of the
genome of each of a statistically signiﬁcant number of
patients taking part in a Phase II/III drug trial to identify
markers associated with a particular observed drug response
or side effect. Alternatively, such a high-resolution map can
be generated from a combination of some ten-million known
single nuc eotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the human
genome. As used herein, a “SNP” is a common alteration
that occurs in a single nucleotide base in a stretch of DNA.
For examp e, a SNP may occur once per every 1,000 bases
of DNA. A SNP may be involved in a disease process;
however, tie vast majority may not be disease-associated.
Given a genetic map based on the occurrence of such SNPs,
individuals can be grouped into genetic categories depend-
ing on a articular pattern of SNPs in their individual
genome. In such a manner, treatment regimens can be
tailored to groups of genetically similar individuals, taking
into account traits that may be common among such geneti-
cally similar individuals.

[0083] A ternatively, a method termed the “candidate gene
approach" can be utilized to identify genes that predict drug
response. According to this method, if a gene that encodes
a drug’s target is known (e.g., a protein or a receptor ofthe
present invention), all common variants of that gene can be
fairly easi y identiﬁed in the population and it can be
determined if having one version of the gene versus another
is associated with a particular dnrg response.

[0084] A ternatively, a method termed the “gene expres-
sion proﬁling”, can be utilized to identify genes that predict
drug response. For example, the gene expression of an
animal dosed with a drug (e.g., a molecule or modulator of
the present invention) can give an indication whether gene
pathways related to toxicity have been turned on.

[0085] Information generated from more than one of the
above pharmacogenomics approaches can be used to deter-
mine appropriate dosage and treatment regimens for pro-
phylactic or therapeutic treatment of an individual. This
knowledge, when applied to dosing or drug selection, can
avoid adverse reactions or therapeutic failure and thus
enhance therapeutic or prophylactic efﬁciency when trwting
a subject with a molecule or modulator of the invention,
such as a modulator identiﬁed by one of the exemplary
screening assays described herein. As we have described
previously, this approach can also be used to identify novel
candidate receptor or other genes suitable for further phar-
macological characterization in vitro and in vivo.

[0086] Accordingly, one embodiment provides methods
and kits for identifying a genetic polymorphism predispos-
ing a subject to being responsive to the compound of
US 2019/0030015 A1

Many of these receptors, including the 5-HT2A subclass, are
G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that signal by activat-
ing guanine nucleotide binding proteins (G-proteins), result-
ing in the generation, or inhibition of. second messenger
molecules such as cyclic AMP, inositol phosphates, and
diacylglycerol. These second messengers then modulate the
function of a variety of intracellular enzymes, including
kinases and ion channels, which ultimately affect cellular
excitability and function.

[0056] At least 15 genetically distinct 5-HT receptor sub-
types have been identiﬁed and assigned to one of seven
families (5-HT1-7). Each subtype displays a unique distri-
bution, preference for various ligands, and functional cor-
relate(s). Serotonin may be an important component in
various types of pathological conditions such as certain
psychiatric disorders (depression, aggressiveness, panic
attacks, obsessive compulsive disorders, psychosis, schizo-
phrenia, suicidal tendency), certain neurodegenerative dis-
orders (Alzheimer-type dementia, Parkinsonism, Hunting-
ton’s chorea), anorexia, bulimia, disorders associated with
alcoholism, cerebral vascular accidents, and migraine (Melt-
Zer, Neuropsychopharmacology, 21:106S-llSS (1999);
Barnes & Sharp, Neurapharmacology, 38:1083-1152
(1999); Glennon, Neurosci. Biobehavioral Reu, 14:35
(1990)). Recent evidence strongly implicates the 5-HT2
receptor subtype in the etiology of such medical conditions
as hypertension, thrombosis, migraine, vasospasm, isch-
emia, depression, anxiety, psychosis, schizophrenia, sleep
disorders and appetite disorders.

[0057] Schizophrenia is a particularly devastating neurop-
sychiatric disorder that affects approximately 1% of the
human population. It has been estimated that the total
ﬁnancial cost for the diagnosis, treatment, and lost societal
productivity of individuals affected by this disease exceeds
2% of the gross national product (GNP) of the United States.
Current treatment primarily involves pharmacotherapy with
a class of drugs known as antipsychotics. Antipsychotics are
effective in ameliorating positive symptoms (e.g., halluci-
nations and delusions), yet they frequently do not improve
negative symptoms (e.g., social and emotional withdrawal,
apathy, and poverty of speech).

[0058] Currently, nine major classes of antipsychotics are
prescribed to treat psychotic symptoms. Use of these com-
pounds is limited, however, by their side effect proﬁles.
Nearly all of the “typical" or older generation compounds
have signiﬁcant adverse effects on human motor function.
These “extrapyramidal” side effects, so termed due to their
effects on modulatory human motor systems, can be both
acute (e.g., dystonic reactions, a potentially life threatening
but rare neuroleptic malignant syndrome) and chronic (e.g.,
akathisias, tremors, and tardive dyskinesia). Dmg develop-
ment efforts have, therefore, focused on newer “atypical”
agents free of these adverse effects.

[0059] Antipsychotic drugs have been shown to interact
with a large number of central monoaminergic neurotrans-
mitter receptors, including dopaminergic, serotonergic,
adrenergic, muscarinic, and histaminergic receptors. It is
likely that the therapeutic and adverse effects of these drugs
are mediated by distinct receptor subtypes. The high degree
of genetic and pharmacological homology between these
receptor subtypes has hampered the development of sub-
type-selective compounds, as well as the determination of
the normal physiologic or pathophysiologic role of any
particular receptor subtype. Thus there is a need to develop

Jan. 31, 2019

drugs that are selective for individual receptor classes and
subclasses amongst monoaminergic neurotransmitter recep-
tors.

[0060] The prevailing theory for the mechanism of action
of antipsychotic drugs involves antagonism of dopamine D2
receptors. Unfortunately, it is likely that antagonism of
dopamine D2 receptors also mediates the extrapyramidal
side effects. Antagonism of 5-HT2A is an alternate molecu-
lar mechanism for drugs with antipsychotic eﬁicacy, possi-
bly through antagonism of heightened or exaggerated signal
transduction through serotonergic systems. 5-HT2A antago-
nists are therefore good candidates for treating psychosis
without extrapyramidal side effects.

[0061] Traditionally, these receptors have been assumed to
exist in a quiescent state unless activated by the binding of
an agonist (a drug that activates a receptor). It is now
appreciated that many, if not most, of the GPCR monoamine
receptors, including serotonin receptors, can exist in a
partially activated state in the absence of their endogenous
agonists. This increased basal activity (constitutive activity)
can be inhibited by compounds called inverse agonists. Both
agonists and inverse agonists possess intrinsic activity at a
receptor, in that they alone can activate or inactivate these
molecules, respectively. In contrast, classic or neutral
antagonists compete against agonists and inverse agonists
for access to the receptor, but do not possess the intrinsic
ability to inhibit elevated basal or constitutive receptor-
responses.

[0062] We have elucidated an important aspect of 5-HT2A
receptor function by applying the Receptor Selection and
Ampliﬁcation Technology (US. Pat. No. 5,707,798, 1998;
Chem. Abstr. 128:111548 (1998) and citations therein), to
the study of the 5-HT2 subclass of serotonin receptors.
R-SAT is a phenotypic assay of receptor ﬁinction that
involves the heterologous expression of receptors in mam-
malian ﬁbroblasts. Using this technology we were able to
demonstrate that native 5-HT2A receptors possess signiﬁ-
cant constitutive, or agonist-independent, receptor activity
(U .S. Patent Application Ser. No. 60/103,317, herein incor-
porated by reference). Furthermore, by directly testing a
large number of centrally acting medicinal compounds with
known clinical activity in neuropsychiatric disease, we
determined that compounds with antipsychotic eﬁicacy all
shared a common molecular property Nearly all of these
compounds, which are used by psychiatrists to treat psy-
chosis, were found to be potent 5-HT2A inverse agonists.
This unique clinico-pharmacologic correlation at a single
receptor subtype is compelling evidence that 5-HT2A recep-
tor inverse agonism is a molecular mechanism of antipsy-
chotic efficacy in humans.

[0063] Detailed pharmacological characterization of a
large number of antipsychotic compounds revealed that they
possess broad activity at multiple related receptor subtypes.
Most of these compounds display agonist, competitive
antagonist, or inverse agonist activity at multiple monoam-
inergic receptor subtypes, including serotoninergic, dop-
aminergic, adrenergic, muscarinic and histaminergic recep-
tors. This broad activity is likely responsible for the
sedating, hypotensive, and motor side effects of these com-
pounds. It would therefore be of great advantage to develop
compounds that are selective inverse agonists of the
5-HT2A receptor, but which have little or no activity on
other monamine receptor subtypes, especially dopamine D2
receptors. Such compounds may be useful in the treatment

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0002] The present invention relates to the therapeutic use
of N-(l-methylpiperidin-4-yl)-N-(4-ﬂourophenylmethyl)-
N‘-(4-(2-methylpropyloxy)phenylmethyl)carbamide and
related serotonin 2A/2C receptor inverse agonists to treat a
variety of human neurodegenerative diseases including Par-
kinson’s Disease, Huntington’s Disease, Lewy Body
Dementia, and Alzheimer’s Disease. Speciﬁcally, these
agents improve motor function in Parkinson’s Disease, and
Huntington’s Disease. Speciﬁcally, N-(l-methylpiperidin-4-
yl)-N-(4-ﬂouropheny1methy1)-l\I'—(4-(2—methylpropyloxy)
phenylmethyl)carbarnide and related compounds can be
used to control the behavioral and neuropsychiatric mani-
festations present in all of these disease states. Pharmaceu-
tical compositions comprised of a combination of N-(l-
methylpiperidin-4-y1)-N-(4-ﬂourophenylmethyl)-N'-(4-(2-
methylpropyloxy)pheny1methy1)carbamide and existing
therapeutic agents are also disclosed.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] Neurodegenerative disorders (NDs) are a group of
related human maladies that share a common pathophysi-
ological feature, the progressive degeneration of selective
neuronal populations over the course of time. These neuro-
degenerative diseases include but are not limited to
Alzheimer's Disease and related dementias, Parkinson’s
Disease, Huntington's Disease, Lewy Body Disease and
related movement disorders, and Friedrich’s Ataxia and
related Spinocerebellar Ataxia’s. Each of these disorders has
unique clinical aspects including age of onset, time course of
progression, neurological signs and symptoms, neuropsy-
chiatric symptoms, and sensitivity to known therapeutic

Jan. 31, 2019

agents. In addition, the pathophysiological basis of each of
these disorders is caused by genetic mechanisms unique to
each disease.

[0004] Despite signiﬁcant progress in elucidating the
genetic causes underlying these disparate disorders, rela-
tively little is known about the biochemical mechanisms that
cause the selective neuronal degeneration common to all of
them, In addition, for the most common of these disorders,
including Parkinson’s Disease and Alzheimer’s Disease, the
genetic factors that cause the rare familial forms of these
diseases have been discovered, but the pathophysiological
basis of the vast majority of sporadic cases is still unknown.
Because of this, no speciﬁc therapeutic agents currently
exist that can directly modify disease progression. Instead,
clinicians utilize a variety of existing agents to provide
symptomatic relief of the motor, cognitive, and neuropsy-
chiatric manifestations that characterize these disorders.
None of these existing agents were designed and developed
to speciﬁcally treat patients with NDs,

[0005] Of the various neurological symptoms that charac-
terize the NDs, abnormalities of motor function, including
bradykinesias, dyskinesias and chorea, and the emergence of
neuropsychiatric symptoms, including psychosis, and affec-
tive symptoms such as anxiety and depression, are common
and severely impact upon the patient’s functional status and
quality of life. Unfortunately, most existing therapeutic
agents, including antipsychotics and antidepressants, oﬁen
demonstrate efﬁcacy, yet are very poorly tolerated in these
patients. In addition, the available therapeutic agents for
Parkinson's Disease, including L—dopa and dopamine ago-
nists, while generally eifective, cause the emergence of
severe treatment-limiting side effects that are currently
intractable to pharmacotherapy.

[0006] Multiple factors, both disease and drug related, are
primarily responsible for the limited tolerability of these
agents. First, patients with neurodegenerative disease are
particularly sensitive to most therapeutic agents that are
designed to cross the blood-brain barrier and interact with
neuronal targets that confer eﬂicacy against adverse motoric
or neuropsychiatric symptoms. For instance, atypical antip-
sychotics are generally well tolerated by healthy volunteers,
or in patients with primary psychiatric disorders like schizo-
phrenia; brain states that are not characterized by neuronal
degeneration. In contrast, when these agents are adminis-
tered to patients with Parkinson’s or Huntington’s Disease,
they display severe, treatment-limiting adverse effects on
motor function, cause severe sedation, and can worsen
cognitive functioning. The direct effects of the neuronal loss
characteristic of NDs, and the adaptive changes that occur
secondarily to this are both posited to create a neurochemi-
cal and/or neurophysiological state in ND patients that
confer this extra sensitivity.

[0007] Second, the known mechanisms of action of these
drugs, including antagonism of dopamine receptors, is not
tolerated in some patient populations secondary to speciﬁc
alterations in distinct neuronal systems. For instance, Par-
kinson’s patients have a relatively selective degeneration of
the ascending dopaminergic neuronal systems, and as a
consequence of this they are deﬁcient in central dopamine
neurotransmission. It is therefore not surprising that drugs
that further attenuate dopaminergic neurotransmission, by
blocking dopamine receptors, are not well tolerated.
[0008] Lastly, nearly all presently known therapeutic
agents lack speciﬁcity in their mechanisms of action. Antip-
US 2019/0030015 A1

sychotic and antidepressant drugs possess a multitude of
pharmacologically relevant interactions with critical neu-
ronal proteins including a host of cell surface receptors, ion
channels, and re-uptake transporters. This lack of drug target
speciﬁcity is known to confer a variety of adverse effects in
non-ND patient populations, which are qualitatively and
quantitatively worse in ND patients.

[0009] These observations highlight the need to develop
novel therapeutic agents that are speciﬁcally designed to not
only demonstrate eﬁicacy against these particular disabling
symptoms but to also possess tolerability in these speciﬁc
patient populations. This can be achieved by improving the
selectivity of the drug target interactions of new therapeutic
agents. Speciﬁcally, the development of agents with novel
mechanisms of action that avoid the known pitfalls associ-
ated with existing agents is desired. In addition, improved
selectivity can avoid the known adverse elfects associated
with interactions with non-efﬁcacy conferring drug targets.

PINTM), and diazepam (VALIUMTM). In other embodiments,
the additional therapeutic agent is an anti-psychotic agent
with dopaminergic receptor antagonism. In other embodi-
ments, the additional therapeutic agent is an anti-psychotic
agent selected from chlorpromazine (THORAZINETM),
haloperidol (HALDOLTM), molindone (MOBANTM), thior-
idazine (MELLARILTM), a phenothiazine, a butyrophenone,
diphenylbutylpiperidine (pimozide), thioxanthines (ﬂupen-

done, aripiprazole, and their active metabolites (N -desmeth-
ylclozapine, N-desmethylolanzapine, 9-OH-risperidone).

[0015] Also disclosed herein is a method for treating a
neurodegemative disease comprising: identifying a patient
suffering from a neurodegenerative disease and administer-
ing to the patient an effective amount of an inverse agonist
selective for a serotonin receptor; whereby the dopaminergic
therapy associated dyskinesia is reduced. In some embodi-
ments, the neurodegenerative disease is Parkinson's disease,
Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer's disease, Spinocerebellar
Atrophy, Tourette’s Syndrome, Friedrich’s Ataxia,
Machado-Joseph’s disease, Lewy Body Dementia, Dysto-
nia, Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, or Frontotemporal
Dementia. In one embodiment, the serotonin receptor is a
5HT2A receptor. In another embodiment, the serotonin
receptor is a 5HT2C receptor. In some embodiments, the
inverse agonist binds to a 5HT2A receptor or a 5HT2C
receptor. In some embodiments, the inverse agonist is the
compound of formula (I) One embodiment further com-
prises administering a dopaminergic agent in combination
with the compound of formula (I). In some embodiments,
the reagent increases dopaminergic activity and is selected
from the group consisting of levodopa, SINAME'ITM,
SINAMETCRTM, bromocriptine (PARLODELTM), per-
golide (PERMAXTM), ephedrine sulfate (EPHEDRINETM),
pemoline CYLERTTM), mazindol (SANOREXTM), d,1,a-
methylphenethylamine (ADDERALLTM), methylphenidate
(RITALINTM), pramipexole (MIRAPEXTM), modaﬁnil
(PROVIGILTM), and ropinirole (REQUIPTM).

[0016] Also disclosed herein is, a method for treating
dyskinesia associated with dopaminergic therapy compris-
ing: identifying a patient suffering from dopaminergic
therapy associated dyskinesia and administering to the
patient an effective amount of an inverse agonist selective
for a serotonin receptor; whereby the dopaminergic therapy
associated dyskinesia is reduced. In one embodiment the
serotonin receptor is a 5HT2A receptor In another embodi-
ment the serotonin receptor is a 5HT2C receptor. In some
embodiments, the inverse agonist binds to a 5HT2A receptor
and a 5HT2C receptor. In one embodiment, the inverse
agonist is the compound of fonnula (I). Some embodiments
further comprise administering an anti-dyskensia agent in
US 2019/0030015 A1

of human disease (eg, as anti-psychotics), and may avoid
the adverse side effects associated with non-selective recep-
tor interactions.

[0064] The compound of formula (I) is active at mono-
amine receptors, speciﬁcally serotonin receptors. In one
embodiment, the compound acts as inverse agonist at the
5-HT2A receptor. Thus, experiments performed on cells
transiently expressing the human phenotype of said receptor
have shown that the compound of formula (I) attenuates the
signaling of such receptors in the absence of additional
ligands acting upon the receptor. The compound has thus
been found to possess intrinsic activity at this receptor and
is able to attenuate the basal, non-agonist-stimulated, con-
stitutive signaling responses that the 5-HT2A receptor dis-
plays. The observation that the compound of formula (I) is
an inverse agonist also indicates that the compound has the
ability to antagonize the activation of 5-HT2A receptors that
is mediated by endogenous agonists or exogenous swithetic
agonist ligands.

[0065] In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I)
shows a relatively high degree of selectivity towards the
5-HT2A subtype of serotonin receptors relative to other
subtypes of the serotonin (S-HT) family of receptors as well
as to other receptors, most particularly the monoaminergic
G-protein coupled receptors, such as dopamine receptors.
[0066] The compound of formula (I) may therefore be
useful for treating or alleviating symptoms of disease cori-
ditions associated with impaired function, in particular
elevated levels of activity, of especially 5-HT2A receptors,
whether this impaired function is associated with improper
levels of receptor stimulation or phenotypical aberrations.
[0067] Others have previously hypothesized that certain
neuropsychological diseases might be caused by altered
levels of constitutive activity of monoamine receptors. Such
constitutive activity might be modiﬁed via contacting the
relevant receptor with a synthetic inverse agonisti By
directly testing a large number of centrally acting medicinal
compounds with known clinical activity in neuropsychiatric
disease, we determined that compounds with antipsychotic
eﬁicacy all shared a common molecular property. Nearly all
of these compounds that are used by psychiatrists to treat
psychosis were found to be potent 5-HT2A inverse agonists.
This correlation is compelling evidence that 5-HT2A recep-
tor inverse agonism is a molecular mechanism of antipsy-
chotic eﬁicacy in humans.

[0068] Detailed pharmacological characterization of a
large number of antipsychotic compounds in our laboratory
revealed that they possess broad activity at multiple related
receptor subtypes, Most of these compounds display either
agonist, competitive antagonist, or inverse agonist activity at
multiple monoaminergic receptor subtypes including sero-
toninergic, dopaminergic, adrenergic, muscarinic and hista-
minergic receptors. This broad activity is likely responsible
for the sedating, hypotensive, and motor side effects of these
compounds. In one embodiment, the compound of formula
(1) possesses eﬂicacy as, for example, a novel antipsychotic,
but will have fewer or less severe side effects than existing
compounds.

[0069] In one embodiment a method is provided to inhibit
activity of a monoamine receptor. This method comprises
contacting a monoamine receptor or a system containing the
monamine receptor, with an effective amount of the com-
pound of formula (I). According to one embodiment, the
monamine receptor is a serotonin receptor. In one embodi-

Jan. 31, 2019

ment, the compound is selective for the 5-HT2A receptor
subclass. In another embodiment, the compound has little or
substantially no activity to other types of receptors, includ-
ing other serotonergic receptors and most particularly,
monoaminergic G-protein coupled receptors, such as dop-
aminergic receptors.

[0070] The system containing the monoamine receptor
may, for example, be a subject such as a mammal, non-
human primate or a human. The receptor may be located in
the central or peripheral nervous system, blood cells or
platelets.

[0071] The system may also be an in vivo or in vitro
experimental model, such as a cell culture model system that
expresses a monamine receptor, a cell-free extract thereof
that contains a monoamine receptor, or a puriﬁed receptor.
Non-limiting examples of such systems are tissue culture
cel s expressing the receptor or extracts or lysates thereof.
Cells that may be used in the present method include any
cel s capable of mediating signal transduction via monoam-
ine receptors, especially the 5-HT2A receptor, either via
enc ogenous expression of this receptor (eg, certain types of
neuronal cells lines, for example, natively express the
S-P T2A receptor), or following transfection of cells with
plasmids containing the receptor gene. Such cells are typi-
cal y mammalian cells (or other eukaryotic cells, such as
insect cells or Xenopus oocytes), because cells of lower
organisms generally lack the appropriate signal transduction
pathways for the present purpose. Examples of suitable cells
inc ude: the mouse ﬁbroblast cell line NIH 3T3 (ATCC CRL
1658), which responds to transfected 5-HT2A receptors by
stimulating growth; RAT 1 cells (Pace et all, Proc. Natl.
Acad. Sci. USA 88:7031-35 (1991)); and pituitary cells
(Vallar et al., Nature 330:556-58 (1987). Other useful mam-
ma ian cells for the present method include HEK 293 cells,
CPO cells, and COS cells,

[0072] One embodiment provides methods of inhibiting
activity of a native, mutated or modiﬁed monoamine recep-
tor, Also provided are kits for performing the same. In one
embodiment, the activity of the receptor is a signaling
activity In another embodiment, the activity of the receptor
is the constitutive basal activity of the receptor.

[0073] In one embodiment, the activity of the receptor is
a response, such as a signaling response, to an endogenous
agonist, such as S-HT, or an exogenous agonistic agent, such
as a drug or other synthetic ligand. The compound of
formula (I) may act by either inversely agonizing or antago-
nizing the receptor,

[0074] In one embodiment, the compound of formula (I) is
an inverse agonist selective for the 5-HT2A receptor and the
compound has little or substantially no activity toward other
serotonergic or other monoaminergic receptors, such as
dopaminergic receptors.

[0075] In a further embodiment, a method is provided for
inhibiting an activation of a monoamine receptor comprising
contacting the monoamine receptor, or a system containing
the monoamine receptor, with the compound of formula (I).
The activation of the receptor may be due to an exogenous
or endogenous agonist agent, or may be the constitutive
activation associated with a native, mutated or modiﬁed
receptor. The receptor may be puriﬁed or present in an in
vitro or in vivo systemi The receptor may also be present in
the central or peripheral nervous system, blood cells or
platelets of a nonhuman or human subject. Also provided are
kits for performing the same.

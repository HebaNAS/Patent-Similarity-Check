[0062] In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity can be used to treat bone marrow lesions.

[0063] In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity can be used to treat bone marrow lesions of the knee,
shoulder, ankle, wrist, hand, ﬁngers, spine, or hip.

[0064] Commonly used measures of pain intensity include
the visual analog scale (VAS) and the numerical rating scale
(NRS). With the VAS approach, patients rate the severity of
their pain by marking a point on a 10—cm (or 100 mm) VAS
(0:no pain and 10worst possible pain). With the NRS
approach, patients rate the severity of their pain by verbally
responding to a 10—point NRS (0:no pain and 10:worst
possible pain). VAS and NRS scores have been shown to be
strongly correlated (slope of regression line, 101), indicat-
ing that a score on the lO-cm VAS is equivalent to the same
score on 10—point NRS (Bijur P E et al. Acad Emerg Med
2003; 10:390-392). For example, a VAS score of 5 cm (or 50
mm) is equivalent to an NRS score of 5. Knee pain in a
person with a VAS score of 5 cm or 50 mm or higher, or an
NRS score of 5 or higher, may be referred to herein as
moderate to severe knee pain.

[0065] In some embodiments, the patient suﬁering from
pain, inﬂammation, a similar condition, or any of the con-
ditions described herein, has an NRS of 5 or greater, or a
VAS of 5 cm or greater. In some embodiments, the patient
has an NRS of 4 or greater. or a VAS of 4 cm or greater In
some embodiments, the patient has an NRS of 6 or greater,
or a VAS of 6 cm or greater, In some embodiments, the
patient has an NRS of 7 or greater, or a VAS of 7 cm or
greater In some embodiments, the patient has an NRS of
about 1, about 2, about 3, about 4, about 5, about 6, about
7, about 8, about 9, or about 10. In some embodiments, the
patient has a VAS of about 1 cm, about 2 cm, about 3 cm,
about 4 cm, about 5 cm, about 6 cm, about 7 cm, about 8 cm,
about 9 cm, or about 10 cm.

[0066] For knee pain or pain associated with bone marrow
lesions, in some embodiments, treatment with a nitrogen-
containing bisphosphonate such as zoledronic acid may
decrease the visual analog (VAS) pain score measured using
a 100 mm scale, by at least about 5 mm, at least about 8 mm,
at least about 10 mm, at least about 15 mm, up to about 50
mm, or up to about 100 mm. In some embodiments, the VAS
score, may be decreased by at least about 5 mm, at least
about 8 mm, at least about 10 mm, at least about 15 m, up
to about 50 mm, or up to about 100 mm, as compared to a
placebo.

[0067] Treatment with a nitrogen-containing bisphospho-
nate such as zoledronic acid may decrease the numerical
rating scale (NRS) pain score measured using a 0-10 scale,
by at least about 0.1, at least about 0.5, at least about 0.8, at
least about 1, at least about 15, up to about 5, or up to about
10. In some embodiments, the NRS score may be decreased
by at least about 0.1, at least about 0.5, at least about 08, at
least about 1, at least about 1.5, up to about 5, or up to about
10, as compared to a placebo.

[0068] In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity can be used to reduce the size of bone marrow
lesions. The area of the lesions may be measured as the total
area of all lesions or as the area of any one lesion. In some
embodiments, the tow] area includes the medial tibial area,
the medial femoral area, the lateral tibial area, and the lateral
femoral area. In some embodiments the bone marrow lesion
in located in the patella.

[0069] In some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of
osteoclast activity achieves a reduction in the total area of
the bone marrow lesions of at least about 240 mmz. In some
embodiments, the reduction in total area is at least about 220
m2, at least about 200 mm2, at least about 150 mrnz, at
least about 100 mmz, or at least about 50 mmz. In some
embodiments, the reduction in size of bone marrow lesions
represents a reduction relative to baseline of at least about
10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about
40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about
70% at least about 80%, at least about 90%, or about 100%.
In some embodiments, the reduction in area of bone marrow
lesions represents an improvement relative to placebo of at
least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least about 30%, at
least about 40%, at last about 50%, at least about 60%, at
least about 70%, at least about 80%, at least about 90%, at
least about 100%, at least about 120%, at least about 150%,
at least about 170%, at least about 200%, at least about
250%, at least about 300%, at least about 350%, at least
about 400%, or at least about 450%. In some embodiments,
the use of an inhibitor of osteoclast activity inhibits an
increase in the size of the bone marrow lesions over time.

[0070] Joint space narrowing (JSN) is typically graded
using the Osteoarthritis Research Society International
(OARSI) atlas criteria. or the Kellgren and Lawrence (K/L)
system. The OARSI atlas criteria grades JSN using a 0—3
scale with Grade 0 indicating an absence of J SN, and Grades
1, 2 and 3 indicating mild, moderate, and severe J SN,
respectively (Altman and Gold, Osteoarthritis Cartilage
2007; 15(Suppl A):A1-A56). The K/L system grades JSN
using a 0-4 scale with Grade 0 indicating an absence of .1 SN,
Grade 1 indicating doubtful JSN, and grades 2, 3 and 4
indicating minimal, moderate, and severe J SN, respectively
(Kellgren and Lawrence, Arm Rheum Dis 1957; 16:494-
502). Based on these criteria, OARSI Grade 0 (absence of
J SN), approximates K/L Grades 0-1 (absence of, or doubtful
presence of JSN). Knee pain in a person having OARSI
Grade 0 or K/L Grade or 1 JSN in the knee where the pain
occurs may be referred to herein as a “normal joint space
knee pain.”

[007]] In some embodiments for patients having OARSI
Grade 0 or K/L Grades 0-1 J SN, the use of an inhibitor of
osteoclast activity achieves a reduction in the total area of
the bone marrow lesions of at least about 240 mmz. In some
embodiments, the reduction in total area is at least about 220
mrnz, at least about 200 mmz, at least about 150 mrnz, at
least about 100 m2, or at least about 50 m2. In some
embodiments, the reduction in size of bone marrow lesions
represents a reduction relative to baseline of at least about
10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about
25%, at least about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about
40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%, at least about
60%, at least about 70% at least about 80%, at least about
90%, or about 100%. In some embodiments, the reduction in
area of bone marrow lesions represents an improvement
relative to placebo of at least about 10%, at least about 20%,
at least about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%,
at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%,

activity inhibits an increase in the size of bone marrow
lesions over time.

[0072] In some embodiments for patients having OARSI
Grades 1-2 or K/L Grades 2—4 JSN, the use of an inhibitor
of osteoclast activity achieves a reduction in the total area of
the bone marrow lesions of at least about 100 m2. In some
embodiments, the reduction in total area is at least about 50
mm2, at least about 60 mmz, at least about 80 m2, at least
about 85 m2, at least about 90 m2, at least about 100
m2, at least about 105 m2, at least about 110 nnn2, or at
least about 115 mm? In some embodiments, the reduction in

to baseline of at least about 10%, at least about 20%, at least
about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least
about 60%, at least about 70% at least about 80%, at least

about 350%, at least about 400%, or at least about 450%. In
some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity inhibits an increase in the size of bone marrow
lesions over time

[0073] In some embodiments, an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity, such as a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate,
including e.g. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, etc., is used
to treat ﬁbromyalgia.

[0074] According to some embodiments, administration
of an inhibitor of osteoclast activity achieves a reduction in
pain that lasts at least about one month, two months, three
months, four months, six months, or even at least about
twelve months. According some embodiments. administra-
tion of an inhibitor of osteoclast activity achieves a reduc-
tion in pain that is observed at greater than three hours, at
about one day, at about two to about ﬁve days, at about one
week, at about two weeks, at about three weeks, at about one
month, at about ﬁve weeks, at about six weeks, at about
seven weeks, at about two months, at about nine weeks, at
about ten weeks, at about eleven weeks, at about three
months, at about four months, at about six months, or at
about twelve months after administration of the inhibitor of
osteoclast activity.

[0075] According some embodiments, administration of
an inhibitor of osteoclast activity achieves a reduction in
pain that is observed at greater than three hours, but at or
before one week, two weeks, three weeks, four weeks, ﬁve
weeks, six weeks, seven weeks, eight weeks, nine weeks, ten
weeks, eleven weeks, twelve weeks, four months, ﬁve

tration remains reduced for up to three months, four months,
ﬁve months, six months, or even up to twelve months or
more. According to some embodiments, after the adminis-
tration of an inhibitor of osteoclast activity, the area of bone
marrow lesions relative to the size prior to administration is
reduced at about three months, at about four months, at
about ﬁve months. at about six months. or at about twelve
months

[0078] According to some embodiments, aﬁer administra-
tion of an inhibitor of osteoclast activity, the size of Modic
changes or VESCs relative to the size prior to administration
remains reduced for up to three months, four months, ﬁve
months, six months, or even up to twelve months or more.
According to some embodiments, aﬁer the administration of
an inhibitor ofosteoclast activity, the size of Modic changes
or VESCs relative to the size prior to administration is
reduced at about three months, at about four months, at
about ﬁve months, at about six months, or at about twelve

[0079] In some embodiments, an osteoclast inhibitor, such
as a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, e.g. zoledronic
acid, ibandronic acid or minodronic acid, may be adminis-
tered to relieve complex regional pain syndrome, such as
complex regional pain syndrome type I (CRPS—I), complex
regional pain syndrome type II (CRPS-II), CRPS-NOS, or
another type of CRPS.

[0080] In some embodiments, zoledronic acid or another
bisphosphonate may be administered orally to relieve com-
plex regional pain syndrome, such as complex regional pain
syndrome type I (CRPS-I), complex regional pain syndrome
type II (CRPS-II), CRPS-NOS, or another type of CRPS,
CRPS is a type of inﬂammatory pain, CRPS can also have
a neuropathic component.

[0081] Complex regional pain syndrome is a debilitating
pain syndrome. It is characterized by severe pain in a limb
that can be accompanied by edema, and autonomic, motor
and sensory changesi

[0082] In some embodiments, an osteoclast inhibitor, such
as a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, e.g. zoledronic
acid or minodronic acid, may be used to reduce the use of
non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug (NSAIDs), opioids, or
other pain medications, for a patient sulfering from pain,
inﬂammation, a similar condition, or any condition
described herein. For example, use of NSAIDs, opioids, or
other pain medications may be reduced by at least about 5%,
at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at least about 20%,

at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at least about 50%,
at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%,
or at least about 90%, up to about 100%, as compared to the
use of NSAIDs, opioids or other pain medications without
administration of the osteoclast inhibitor. Use of the opioids,
NSAIDs, or other pain medications may be reduced by at
least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about 15%, at
least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at
least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least about 45%, at
least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about 70%, at
least about 80%, or at least about 90%, up to about 100%,
as compared to the use of NSAIDS, opioids, or other pain
medications at baseline.

[0205] In some embodiments, the osteoclast inhibitor
comprises zoledronic acid, and the oral zoledronic acid, or
disodium salt thereof, may be administered in combination
with about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg of zoledronic acid, or a
salt thereof, administered parenterally, such as intrave-
nously. In some embodiments, about 50 mg, about 100 mg,
or about 150 mg of the disodium salt of zoledronic acid is
administered orally in combination with 1 mg parenteral,
such as intravenous, zoledronic acid. In some embodiments
the parenteral dose of zoledronic acid is about 0.25 mg to
about 25 mg, about 0.25 mg to about 10 mg, or about 0.5 mg
to about 7.5 mg.

[0206] With respect to oral administration of an osteoclast
inhibitor, such as zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, iban-
dronic acid, or another bisphosphonate, for the treatment of
pain associated with inﬂammation, arthritis, CRPS, or any
other condition recited herein, it may helpful if the mammal
or human being to which the osteoclast inhibitor is admin-
istered does not eat food or drink beverage, (other than any
water required to swallow the oral dosage form) for at least
about 1 hour, at least about 2 hours, at least about 4 hours,
at least about 6 hours, at least about 8 hours, at least about
10 hours, or at least about 12 hours before the osteoclast
inhibitor is administered. It may also be helpful if the
manunal or human being to which the osteoclast inhibitor is

administered does not eat food or drink beverage for at least
about 30 minutes, at least about 1 hour, at least about 2
hours, at least about 3 hours, or at least about 4 hours after
the osteoclast inhibitor is administered. In some embodi-
ments, a human being to which the zoledronic acid is
administered avoids lying down, or remains upright or sits
upright, for at least about 30 minutes or about 1 hour after
receiving a dosage form containing the osteoclast inhibitor.
Avoiding food or beverage before or after oral administra-
tion of the osteoclast inhibitor can improve the bioavailabil-
ity of the osteoclast inhibitor,

[0207] The oral bioavailability of osteoclast inhibitor in a
dosage form can vary, Some dosage fomis may have ingre-
dients added to enhance the bioavailability. However, bio-
availability enhancement is not necessary for an oral dosage
form to be eﬂective. In some embodiments, the dosage form
is substantially free of bioavailability-enhancing agents,
such as amino acids or large quantities (eg, at least about
5%, 10%, 20%, 50%, 70%, or more) of carboxylic acid salts,
In some embodiments, an oral dosage form may have an oral
bioavailability of the osteoclast inhibitorisuch as zole-
dronic acid, minodronic acid, ibandronic acidiof about
0.01% to about 10%, about 0.1% to about 7%, about 0.1%
to about 5%, etc. Without ingredients or other methods to
enhance bioavailability, bisphosphonates such as zoledronic
acid typically have a low bioavailability in an oral dosage
form. In some embodiments, the oral bioavailability of
zoledronic acid is unenhanced or substantially unenhanced.
For example, the oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid can
be about 0.01% to about 5%, about 0.01% to about 4%,
about 0.1% to about 3%, about 0.1% to about 2%, about
0.2% to about 2%, about 0.2% to about 15%, about 0.3% to
about 1.5%, about 0.3% to about 1%, about 1% to about 3%,
about 1.2% to about 35%, about 1.2% to about 3%, about
1% to about 4%, about 1.5% to about 45%, about 01% to
about 0.5%, about 0.3% to about 0.5%, about 0.5% to about
1%, about 0.6% to about 0.7%, about 0.7% to about 0.8%,
about 0.8% to about 0.9%, about 09%, about 1% to about
11%, about 1.1% to about 12%, about 1.2% to about 13%,
about 1.3% to about 1.4%, about 1.4% to about 15%, about
1.5% to about 16%, about 1.6% to about 18%, about 1.8%
to about 2%, about 2% to about 2.2%, about 2.2% to about
24%, about 2.4% to about 26%, about 2.6% to about 28%,
about 2.8% to about 3.0%, about 3% to about 32%, about
3.2% to about 3.4%, about 3.4% to about 36%, about 3.6%
to about 38%, about 3.8% to about 4%, about 2% to about
2.5%, or any bioavailability of zoledronic acid in a range
bounded by, or between, any of these values.

[0208] One embodiment is a pharmaceutical composition
comprising an osteoclast inhibitor such as zoledronic acid,
minodronic acid, or ibandronic acid wherein the oral bio-
availability of zoledronic acid in the dosage form is from
about 0.01% to about 10%.

[0209] In some embodiments, the oral bioavailability of
the osteoclast inhibitor in the dosage form is about 0.01% to
about 5%, about 0.1% to about 7%, about 0.1% to about 5%,
about 0.1% to about 3%, about 0.1% to about 2%, about
0.2% to about 2%, about 0.2% to about 15%, about 0.3% to
about 1.5%, or about 03% to about 1.0%.

a reduced molar amount of the disodium salt to be used as
compared to what would be used with the diacid form.

[0047] In some embodiments, the mammal being treated is
not suffering from bone metastasis. In some embodiments,
the mammal being treated is not suﬂering from cancer In
some embodiments, the mammal being treated is not suf-
fering from osteoporosis.

[0048] For example, zoledronic acid or another bisphos-
phonate may be administered orally to relieve musculoskel-
etal pain including low back pain, and pain associated with
rheumatoid ar1hritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, osteoar-
thritis, erosive osteoarthritis, sero-negative (non-rheuma-
toid) arthropathies, non-articular rheumatism, peri-ar'ticular
disorders, axial spondyloarthritis including ankylosing
spondylitis, Paget’s disease, ﬁbrous dysplasia, SAPHO syn-
drome, transient osteoarthritis of the hip, vertebral crush
fractures, osteoporosis, etc. In some embodiments, enhanced
bioavailability of the zoledronic acid may be achieved in
treating one of these conditions by administering a dosage
form comprising zoledronic acid in the form of a disodium
salt. This may allow a reduced molar amount of the diso-
dium salt to be used as compared to what would be used with
the diacid formi

[0049] An osteoclast inhibitor, such as a bisphosphonate,
eg. zoledronic acid, may also be used to treat bone fractures
or to enhance the healing of bone fractures. In some embodi-
ments, a human being that is treated for CRPS, suffered from
a precipitating injury such as a bone fracture associated with
the CRPS at least 4 weeks, at least 8 weeks, at least 12
weeks, at least six months, or at least 1 year before ﬁrst
administering an osteclast inhibitor, such as a bisphospho-
nate, including zoledronic acid, neridronic acid, etc.
Examples of a precipitating event include a fracture, a
cutting injury, a scratch, a puncture injury, etc

[0050] In some embodiments, zoledronic acid or another
bisphosphonate may also be administered orally to relieve
neuropathic pain, including diabetic peripheral neuropathy,
post-herpetic neuralgia, trigeminal neuralgia, monoradicu-
lopathies, phantom limb pain, and central pain. Other causes
of neuropathic pain include cancer-related pain, lumbar
nerve root compression, spinal cord injury, post-stroke pain,
central multiple sclerosis pain, HIV-associated neuropathy,
and radio-therapy or chemo-therapy associated neuropathy,
In some embodiments, enhanced bioavailability of the zole-
dronic acid may be achieved in treating one of these con-
ditions by administering a dosage form comprising zole-
dronic acid in the form of a disodium salt. This may allow
a reduced molar amount of the disodium salt to be used as
compared to what would be used with the diacid form.

[0051] In some embodiments, zoledronic acid or another
bisphosphonate may be administered orally to relieve
inﬂammatory pain including musculoskeletal pain, arthritis
pain, and complex regional pain syndrome. In some embodi-
ments, enhanced bioavailability of the zoledronic acid may
be achieved in treating one of these conditions by adminis-
tering a dosage form comprising zoledronic acid in the form
of a disodium salt. This may allow a reduced molar amount
of the disodium salt to be used as compared to what would
be used with the diacid form.

[0052] Examples of musculoskeletal pain include low
back pain; and pain associated with vertebral crush fractures,

ﬁbrous dysplasia, osteogenesis imperfecm, Paget’s disease
of bone, transient osteoporosis, and transient osteoporosis of
the hip.

[0053] Arthritis refers to inﬂammatory joint diseases that
can be associated with pain. Examples of arthritis pain
include pain associated with osteoarthritis, erosive osteoar-
thritis, rheumatoid arthritis, juvenile rheumatoid arthritis,
sero-negative (non-rheumatoid) arthropathies, non-articular
rheumatism, peri-articular disorders, neuropathic arthropa-
thies including Charcot’s foot, axial spondyloarthritis
including ankylosing spondylitis, and SAPHO syndrome.
[0054] In some embodiments, a human being that is
treated for a disease or condition, such as an inﬂammatory
condition, e.g. arthritis or CRPS, by an osteoclast inhibitor,
such as a bisphosphonate, eg an oral dosage form of
zoledronic acid, has an age of at least 18 years, at least 50
years (including a male of at least 50 years), a postmeno-
pausal female, about 10 years to about 90 years, about 20
years to about 80 years, about 30 years to about 75 years,
about 40 years to about 70 years, about 1 year to about 16
years, or about 80 years to about 95 years. In some embodi-
ments, the human being is a male at least 50 years of age or
a postmenopausal female, with knee osteoarthritis (OA) and
bone marrow lessions (BMLs), having moderate or worse
knee pain,

[0055] In some embodiments, a human being that is
treated for a disease or condition, such as an inﬂammatory
condition, eg. arthritis, low back pain, or CRPS, by an
osteoclast inhibitor, such as a bisphosphonate, e.g. an oral
dosage form of zoledronic acid, has suffered from the
inﬂammatory condition for at least 1 month, at least 2
months, at least 3 months, at least 6 months, or at least 1
year.

[0056] In some embodiments, the arthritis affects a knee,
an elbow, a ﬁnger, a wrist, a shoulder, an ankle, the spine, or
a hip

[0057] For treatment of arthritis or joint pain, such as knee
pain, in some embodiments the person being treated has
OARSI Grade 0, or Kellgren and Lawrence Grades 0 or 1,
joint space narrowing.

[0058] In some embodiments, the person has lesions, such
as bone marrow lesions. In some embodiments the person
being treated for bone marrow lesions has normal joint space
knee pain, OARSI Grade 0, or Kellgren and Lawrence
Grades 0 or 1, joint space narrowing.

[0059] In some embodiments, the person has baseline pain
intensity of 5 or greater measured using the 0-10 numerical
rating scale (NRS), or 50 mm or greater using the 100 mm
visual analog scale (VAS) In some embodiments the person
being treated for pain has normal joint space knee pain,
OARSI Grade 0, or Kellgren and Lawrence Grades 0 or 1,
joint space narrowing.

[0060] Bone marrow lesions (BMLs) include regional
bone marrow signal intensity alterations on magnetic reso-
nance imaging (MRI). BMLs can be present in the knee and
can be an important feature of osteoarthritis of the knee.
BMLs have also been described in other rheumatic condi-
tions such as rheumatoid arthritis, osteonecrosis, ankylosing
spondylitis, and transient osteoporosis of the hip and are
often referred to as bone marrow edema (BME).

[0061] In some embodiments, a person being treated for
arthritis, such as with zoledronic acid, has osteoarthritis of
the knee associated with bone marrow lesions.

Dﬂsmmib [0046] An oral dosage form of a bisphosphonate such as

zoledronic acid may be used to treat, or provide relief of, any
type of pain including, but not limited to, inﬂammatory pain,
arthritis pain, complex regional pain syndrome, Iumbosacral

HN pain, musculoskeletal pain, neuropathic pain, chronic pain,

eight months, about nine months, about 10 months, about 11
months, or about one year or more, alter the administration
of osteoclast inhibitor.

[0084] With respect to use of oral zoledronic acid in a
disodium salt form or in an acid form for relieving pain
associated with an inﬂammatory condition or Paget’s dis-
ease of bone, relief of pain can be short-term, e.g. for a
period of hours after administration of the dosage form,
and/or relief of pain can be long-tenn, e.g. lasting for days,
weeks, or even months aﬁer oral administration of zole-
dronic acid. In some embodiments, a mammal, such as a
human being, experiences signiﬁcant pain relief at least
about 3 hours, at least about 6 hours, at least about 12 hours,
at least about 24 hours, at least about 48 hours, at least about
one week, at least about 2 weeks, or at least about 3 weeks
aﬁer administration of an oral dosage form comprising
zoledronic acid. In some embodiments, a mammal, such as
a human being, experiences signiﬁcant pain relief during at
least part of the time from about 3 hours to about 2 weeks,
about 3 hours to about 3 weeks, about 3 hours to about 24
hours, about 6 hours to about 2 weeks, or about 6 hours to
about 24 hours, about 3 days to about 2 weeks, about 6 days
to about 2 weeks, after administration of an oral dosage form
comprising zoledronic acid. In some embodiments, a human
being treated has signiﬁcant pain relief at one month, three
months, six months, nine months, one year, 5 years, or
longer, after administration of the most recent dose of an
osteoclast inhibitor such as zoledronic acid.

[0085] With respect to the treatment of any condition
recited herein, in some embodiments a ﬁrst oral dosage form
comprising zoledronic acid is administered and a second
oral dosage form comprising oral zoledronic acid is admin-
istered. The timing of the administration of the two dosage
forms may be such that, with respect to the ﬁrst oral dosage
form, the second oral dosage with respect to the ﬁrst oral
dosage form, the second oral dosage form is administered at
SXTMX or greater (e.g., if Tm“ is 1 hour, at 5 hours or later),
at least IOXTMX or greater, at least about 15mex or greater,
at least about 20XTM,‘ or greater, at least about SOXTmu or
greater, or at least about 200><TWX or greater, wherein T"WC
is the time of maximum plasma concentration for the ﬁrst

oral dosage form.

[0086] Some embodiments include treatment of a condi-
tion recited herein, such as inﬂammatory pain, arthritis, or
complex regional pain syndrome, wherein the treatment
comprises either: administering only one dosage form to a
mammal to treat the condition, or administering a ﬁrst
dosage form to the mammal, followed by administering a
second dosage form to the mammal. If two or more dosage
forms are administered, the second oral dosage form is
administered before the maximum pain relieving eifect of
the ﬁrst oral dosage form is achieved, or before a peak in the
pain relieving effect of the ﬁrst oral dosage form is experi-
enced by a mammal, receiving the dosage form. In some
embodiments, the second oral dosage form is administered
before an observable pain relieving eifect is achieved. In
some embodiments, the second dosage form is administered
about 12 hours to about 60 days, about 24 hours to about 28
days, about 24 hours to about 7 days, about 24 hours to about
14 days, or about 24 hours to about 21 days, after the ﬁrst
dosage form is administered.

[0087] Some embodiments include treatment of a condi-
tion recited herein, such as inﬂammatory pain, arthritis, or

Jan. 31, 2019

complex regional pain syndrome, wherein the treatment
comprises administering a ﬁrst dosage form to the mammal,
followed by administering a second dosage form to the
mammal, wherein the second dosage form is administered
after the maximum pain relieving eﬁect of the ﬁrst oral
dosage form is achieved, and the second oral dosage form is
administered while the mammal is still experiencing pain
relief from the ﬁrst oral dosage form, or while the pain
relieving effect from the ﬁrst oral dosage form is observable.
In some embodiments, the second dosage form is adminis-
tered about 12 hours to about 60 days, about 24 hours to
about 28 days, about 24 hours to about 7 days, about 24
hours to about 14 days, or about 24 hours to about 21 days,
aﬁer the ﬁrst dosage form is administered.

[0088] Zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate may
also be administered orally to relieve cancer-related pain,
including pain associated with multiple myeloma and bone
metastases from solid tumors. In some embodiments, zole-
dronic acid is used to treat pain that is not cancer-related
pain. For example. zoledronic acid may be used to treat pain
that is not associated with multiple myeloma, bone metas-
tasis from solid tumors, hypercalcemia of malignancy, giant
cell tumor of bone, blood cancers or leukemias, or solid
tumors or cancers. In some embodiments, enhanced bio-
availability of the zoledronic acid may be achieved in
treating one of these conditions by administering a dosage
form comprising zoledronic acid in the form of a disodium
salt. This may allow a reduced molar amount of the diso-
dium salt to be used as compared to what would be used with
the diacid form.

[0089] In addition to relieving pain. oral administration of
zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate may also be
useful to treat diseases or conditions that may or may not
include a pain component. For example, zoledronic acid or
another bisphosphonate may be useful to treat any of the
pain conditions or types of conditions listed above, includ-
ing treatment that does not simply relieve the pain of those
conditions, and treatment that is carried out in such a way
that the condition is treated without pain relief occurring. In
addition to any pain relief zoledronic acid or another bis-
phosphonate may or may not provide, zoledronic acid or
another bisphosphonate may be used to treat a disease or
condition such as a metabolic disease or condition; an
inﬂammatory disease or condition, including an inﬂamma-
tory disease or condition that is not associated with pain; a
cancer disease or condition; a neurological disease or con-
dition; etc. In some embodiments, enhanced bioavailability
of the zoledronic acid may be achieved in treating one of
these conditions by administering a dosage form comprising
zoledronic acid in the form of a disodium salt. This may
allow a reduced molar amount of the disodium salt to be
used as compared to what would be used with the diacid
form.

[0090] In some embodiments, oral administration of zole-
dronic acid or another bisphosphonate may also be useful to
treat complex regional pain syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis,
osteoarthritis, erosive osteoarthritis, axial spondyloarthritis
including ankylosing spondylitis, acute vertebral crush frac-
ture, ﬁbrous dysplasia, SAPHO syndrome, osteoporosis,
transient osteoporosis, or transient osteoporosis of the hip. In
some embodiments, enhanced bioavailability of the zole-
dronic acid may be achieved in treating one of these con-
ditions by administering a dosage form comprising zole-
dronic acid in the form of a disodium salt. This may allow

[0149] Oral administration of zoledronic acid, particularly
oral administration of the disodium salt form of zoledronic
acid, can result in more sustained plasma levels of the drug
as compared to parenteral modes of administration, such
intravenous or subcutaneous. For example, the amount of
zoledronic acid in the plasma can be signiﬁcantly higier for
oral administration of the disodium salt about 24 hours or 48
hours, or longer, after administration In some embodiments,
oral zoledronic acid has a 24 hour sustained plasma lewel
factor of about 1 or higher, such as about 1 to about 10, about
1 to about 5, about 3 to about 5, or about 3 to about 4, In
some embodiments, an orally administered dosage form of
zoledronic acid has a 24 hour sustained plasma level factor
or a 48 hour sustained plasma level factor that is higher, such
as at least 12 times, at least about 2 times, at least about 5
times, about 1.2 times to about 20 times, about 2 times to
about 15 times, about 5 times to about 10 times, or about 8
to about 15 times that of intravenously administered zole-
dronic acid. A “sustained plasma level factor,” pf, is deter-
mined by the equation:

FFlOOWC/me)

wherein Cm” is the maximum plasma concentration of
zoledronic acid after it is administered and C, is the plasma
concentration of zoledronic acid at the time of interest, such
as 24 hours, For parenteral administration, the CW” can be
about the CO, or the concentration right after injection of the
entire amount of the dmg into the body. Sustained plasma
level factors can also be obtained for other times. such as 48
hours, by using the plasma concentration of zoledronic acid
for C, in the equation above, For example, if the maximum
plasma level of zoledronic acid after administration is 1000
ng/mL and the plasma level of zoledronic acid at 24 hours

SUMMARY

[0002] Bisphosphonate compounds are potent inhibitors
of osteoclast activity, and are used clinically to treat bone-
related conditions such as osteoporosis and Paget’s disease
of bone; and cancer-related conditions including multiple
myeloma, and bone metastases from solid tumors. They
generally have low oral bioavailability,

[0003] Patchy osteoporosis and bone marrow edema may
result from osteoclast hyperactivity. Zoledronic acid is a
potent inhibitor of bone resorption and osteoclast activity.
Nitrogen containing bisphosphonates, such as zoledronic
acid, also inhibit the mevalonate pathway in the osteoclast
thereby interrupting normal osteoclast function.

[0004] It has been discovered that oral dosage forms of
bisphosphonate compounds, such as zoledronic acid, can be
used to treat or alleviate pain or related conditions.

[0005] Some embodiments include a method of enhancing
the oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid comprising orally
administering a dosage form containing zoledronic acid in
the disodium salt form.

[0006] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form, wherein
the bioavailability, in a mammal, of zoledronic acid in the

Jan. 31, 2019

disodium salt form is greater than the bioavailability of
zoledronic acid in the diacid form would be in the same
dosage form.

[0007] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in an acid or a salt form, such as the
disodium salt form, wherein the dosage form contains an
amount of zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form that
provides an area under the plasma concentration curve of
zoledronic acid of about 4 nglh/mL to about 2000 ng~h/mL
to a human being to which the dosage form is administered.
[0008] Some embodiments include a dosage form com-
prising zoledronic acid in the disodium salt form, wherein
the disodium salt form is present in a lower molar amount
than would be present if the zoledronic acid were in the
diacid form; and wherein the zoledronic acid in the disodium
salt form has an improved bioavailability as compared to the
zoledronic acid in the diacid form to the extent that the lower
molar amount of the disodium salt in the dosage form does
not reduce the amount of zoledronic acid delivered to the
plasma of a mammal,

[0009] Although an oral dosage form with enhanced bio-
availability with respect to the bisphosphonate compound
can be used, the treatment can also be eﬂective using an oral
dosage form that includes a bisphosphonate compound, such
as zoledronic acid, wherein the bioavailability of the bis-
phosphonate is unenhanced, or is substantially unenhanced.
[0010] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inﬂammatory pain comprising administering an oral dosage
form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal in need
thereof, wherein the mammal experiences signiﬁcant pain
relief more than 3 hours after administration of the dosage
form.

[0011] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
pain associated with an arthritis comprising administering an
oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a human
being in need thereof.

[0012] Some embodiments include a method of treating
complex regional pain syndrome comprising administering
an oral dosage form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal
in need thereof.

[0013] Some embodiments include an oral dosage fomi
comprising zoledronic acid, wherein the oral bioavailability
of zoledronic acid is substantially unenhanced. For example,
in some embodiments, the oral bioavailability in the dosage
form is about 0.01% to about 4%,

[0014] Some embodiments include a pharmaceutical prod-

uct comprising more than one unit of an oral dosage form
described herein. In some embodiments, each unit of the oral

dosage form contains about 1 mg to about 50 mg of
zoledronic acid.

[0015] Some embodiments include a method of relieving
inﬂammatory pain comprising administering an oral dosage
form containing zoledronic acid to a mammal in need
thereof.

[0016] In some embodiments, the mammal receives a total
monthly dose of zoledronic acid that is about 800 mg/m2 or
less.

[0017] In some embodiments, the dosage form contains
about 10 mg/m2 to about 20 mg/m2 based upon the body
surface area of the mammal.

[0018] Some embodiments include a method of relieving

inﬂammatory pain comprising orally administering zole-
dronic acid to a mammal in need thereof.
US 2019/0030051 A1

[0019] In some embodiments, about 300 mg/m2 to about
600 mg/m2 of zoledronic acid is administered per month,
based upon the body surface area of the mammal.

[0020] In some embodiments, about 50 mg/m2 to about
600 mg/m2 of zoledronic acid is administered per month,
based upon the body surface area of the mammal,

[0021] Some embodiments include administering an
osteoclast inhibitor, such as a bisphosphonate, including
zoledronic acid, neridronic acid, etc. to inhibit the develop-
ment of pain, unweighting, and edema when administered
early such as when a precipitating event such as fracture
occurs, wherein the precipitating event is associated with
CRPS.

[0022] Some embodiments include administering an
osteoclast inhibitor, such as a bisphosphonate, including
zoledronic acid, neridronic acid, etc. to reverse established
allodynia and unweighting when administered at least 4
weeks after a precipitating event such as fracture that is
associated with CRPS.

[0160] An oral dosage form comprising zoledronic acid
having a dose of zoledronic acid and a conﬁguration suitable
for a particular species ofmammal may be conﬁgured so that
the elimination half-life of zoledronic acid in the particular
species of mammal is about 30 hours to about 100 hours,
about 40 hours to about 60 hours, about 40 hours to about
50 hours, about 50 hours to about 60 hours, about 42 hours,
about 51 hours, about 59 hours, or any half-life in a range
bounded by, or between, any of these values.

[0161] As used herein, the “elimination half-life” refers to
the apparent ﬁrst-order terminal plasma elimination half-
life, obtained by non-compartmental analysis using Win-
Nonlin. A terminal plasma elimination half-life is the time
required to reduce the plasma concentration to half after
reaching pseudo-equilibrium, and not the time required to
eliminate half the administered dose. For orally adminis-
tered drugs, terminal plasma elimination half-life can be
affected by absorption of the drug, as well as plasma
clearance and extent of distribution.

[0162] In some embodiments, the disodium salt form of
zoledronic acid provides an enhancement to bioavailability,
as compared to the diacid form of zoledronic acid, which
adds to any enhancement to bioavailability provided by any
bioavailability-enhancing agents in the dosage form. In
some embodiments, the disodium salt form of zoledronic
acid provides an enhancement to bioavailability, as com-
pared to the diacid form of zoledronic acid, which is greater
than any enhancement to bioavailability provided by any
bioavailability-enhancing agents in the dosage form. In
some embodiments, the disodium salt form of zoledronic
acid may be administered in a dosage form that is substan-
tially free of bioavailability-enhancing agents.

[0163] The C-terminal telopeptide (CTX) is one of the
products from type I collagen degradation by osteoclasts
during bone resorption. Thus, CTX serum levels may be
used as a biomarker to indicate and monitor bone break-
down, resorption, and loss. In some embodiments, zole-
dronic acid and other bisphosphonates may be used to
inhibit osteoclast activity and/or lower CTX serum levels,
for example, by at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least
about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least
about 30%, at least about 35%, at least about 40%, at least
US 2019/0030051 A1

a reduced molar amount of the disodiurn salt to be used as
compared to what would be used with the diacid form.
[0091] In some embodiments, oral administration of zole-
dronic acid or another bisphosphonate may also be useful to
treat hypercalcemia of malignancy, multiple myeloma, bone
metastases from solid tumors, Paget’s disease of bone, giant
cell tumor of bone, blood cancers or leukemias, or solid
tumors or cancers, In some embodiments, enhanced bio-
availability of the zoledronic acid may be achieved in
treating one of these conditions by administering a dosage
form comprising zoledronic acid in the form of a disodium
salt. This may allow a reduced molar amount of the diso-
dium salt to be used as compared to what would be used with
the diacid form.

[0095] Unless otherwise indicated, when a compound or
chemical structural feature such as heterocyclyl alkyl is
referred to as being “optionally substituted,” it includes a
feature that has no substituents (i.e. unsubstituted), or a
feature that is substituted, meaning that the feature has one
or more substituents. The term “substituent” has the broadest
meaning known to one of ordinary skill in the art, and
includes a moiety that replaces one or more hydrogen atoms
in a parent compound or structural feature. The term
“replaces" is merely used herein for convenience, and does
not require that the compound be formed by replacing one
atom with another. In some embodiments, a substituent may
be any ordinary organic moiety known in the art, which may
have a molecular weight (eg, the sum of the atomic masses
of the atoms of the substituent) of 15 g/mol to 50 g/mol, 15
g/mol to 100 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 150 g/mol, 15 g/mol to 200

[0096] For convenience, the term “molecular weight” is
used with respect to a moiety or part of a molecule to
indicate the sum of the atomic masses of the atoms in the

[0118] In some embodiments, the administration of an
osteoclast inhibitor, such as a nitrogen-containing bisphos-
phonate, including, e.g, zoledronjc acid, minodronic acid,
etc, to a patient or mammal in need thereof aﬁects Modic
changes (MCs). For example, any of the above compounds
could be used to treat Modic changes, or vertebral endplate
signal changes (V ESC) and bone marrow changes visible
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or neck pain or
back pain associated with Modic changes.

[0099] Unless otherwise indicated, any reference to a
compound herein, such as zoledronic acid, by structure,
name, or any other means, includes pharmaceutically
acceptable salts, such as the disodium salt; alternate solid
forms, such as polymorphs, solvates, hydrates, etc; tautom-
ers; or any other chemical species that may rapidly convert
to a compound described herein under conditions in which
the compounds are used as described herein. Unless other-
wise indicated, a phrase such as “administering a bisphos-
phonate,” “administering an osteoclast inhibitor,” “admin-
istering zoledronic acid,” includes administering any form
of the bisphosphonate, osteoclast inhibitor, zoledronic acid,
etc., such as those recited above.

[0100] In some embodiments, zoledronic acid is adminis-
tered in a dosage form comprising a salt form, such as a salt
of a dianion of zoledronic acid. In some embodiments,
zoledronic acid is administered in a dosage form comprising
a disodium salt form of zoledronic acid. In some embodi-
ments, zoledronic acid is administered in a sodium salt form,
such as a monosodium salt, a disodium salt, a trisodium salt,
etc. In some circumstances, use of the disodium salt may be
desirable. For example, the disodium salt is much more
soluble in water than the diacid form, As a result, in some
processes, the disodium salt can be easier to work with than
the diacid form. Additionally, the sodium salt may be more
bioavailable and/ or more rapidly absorbed when taken orally
as compared to the diacid form.

[0101] In some embodiments, a RANK/RANKL antago-
nists or an osteoclast inhibitor, such as zoledronic acid or
neridronic acid may be in the form of a molecular complex.
For example, molecular complexes of zoledronic acid
include cocrystals, salts, solvates such as hydrates and
mixed solvates of an acid or a salt form, and mixtures
containing such materials. Molecular complexes of zole-
dronic acid may be in amorphous forms or polymorphs.
[0102] Of particular interest are compositions, or com-
plexes comprising zoledronic acid or neridronic acid and the
stande amino acids or natural existing amino acids, such
as alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine,
glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leu-
cine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine,
threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, valine, etc. Some examples
of useful molecular complexes include, but are not limited
to, complexes of zoledronic acid or neridronic acid with
sodium cation, ammonium, ammonia, L-lysine, DL-lysine,
nicotinamide, adenine, glycine, and Selenocysteine.

[0105] Solid forms of zoledronic acid such as complexes
of zoledronic acid with sodium, ammonium, ammonia,
L-lysine, DL-lysine, nicotinamide, adenine and glycine may
be prepared by methods such as dry or solvent-drop grinding
(liquid assisted grinding), heating or solvent evaporation of
their solution in single or mixed solvent systems, slurry
suspension, supercritical ﬂuids or other techniques known to
a person skilled in the art.

[0106] For example, zoledronic acid and nicotinamide
may be complexed by dissolving both compounds in water:
ethyl acetate (1:1 V/v) and allowing the solvents in the
mixture to evaporate to form crystalline material.

[0107] In some embodiments, a zoledronic acid complex
may have an excess at least one coformer (eg. the compo-
nent other than zoledronic acid) to the zoledronic acid
complexes, which may be the same as the coformer in the
complex, a different coformer, or a mixture thereof, In some
embodiments, the excess coformer may be a standard or
natural amino acid. Examples of compounds in salt forms

serum levels in a range bounded by, or between, any of these
values.

[0164] In some embodiments, zoledronic acid in a diso-
dium salt or an acid form and other bisphosphonates includ-
ing salt or acid form may be used to treat Paget’s disease of
Bone or treat pain associated with Paget’s disease of bone
and/or lower serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels. For
example, the reduction of ALP levels by at least about 20%,
at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%,
at least about 80%, about 50-60%, about 60-80%, about
80-90%, about 90-95%, or any other reduction in ALP levels
in a range bounded by, or between, any of these values from
baseline, within 12 months, 18 months, or up to at least 5
years from the time of the last oral administration of
zoledronic acid or other bisphosphonates, In some embodi-
ments, when zoledronic acid in a disodium salt or an acid
form, or other bisphosphonate is administered to treat the
Paget’s disease of bone or pain associated with the Paget’s
disease of bone, the Paget’s disease or the pain associated
with the Paget’s disease has recurrence rate of less than
20%, less than 10%, less than 5%, less than 1%, or does not
return within 12 months, 18 months, or 5 years. or more,
from the time of the last oral administration of zoledronic
acid, or other bisphosphonates.

[0165] In some embodiments, a dosage form comprising a
disodium salt of zoledronic acid is a solid.

[0166] In some embodiments, a dosage form comprising a
disodium salt of zoledronic acid is used to treat an inﬂam-
matory condition.

[0167] In some embodiments, a dosage form comprising a
disodium salt of zoledronic acid is used to treat arthritis
[0168] In some embodiments, a dosage form comprising a
disodium salt of zoledronic acid is used to treat complex
regional pain syndrome.

[0169] In some embodiments, zoledronic acid is in a form
that has an aqueous solubility, meaning the solubility in
water, greater than 1% (w/v), about 5% (w/v) to about 50%
(w/v), about 5% (w/v) to about 20% (w/v), about 10% (w/v)
to about 15% (w/v), or about 12% (w/v) to about 13% (W/v).
[017 0] The disodium salt form of zoledronic acid can be
more compressible than the diacid form of zoledronic acid.
This can make it easier for a dosage form to have a desired
hardness, It can also make it easier to increase the drug load,
so that a smaller tablet can be given for a given dosage
strength. In some embodiments, a solid dosage form of
zoledronic acid, such as the diacid form of zoledronic acid
or the disodium salt form of zoledronic acid, can have a
hardness of about 5 kPa to about 20 kPa or about 5 kPa to
about 14 kPa.

[0171] Zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate may be
combined with a pharmaceutical carrier selected on the basis
of the chosen route of administration and standard pharma-
ceutical practice as described, for example, in Remington’s
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 2005, the disclosure of which is
hereby incorporated herein by reference, in its entirety. The
relative proportions of active ingredient and carrier may be
determined, for example, by the solubility and chemical

Jan. 31, 2019

nature of the compounds, chosen route of administration and
standard pharmaceutical practice.

[0172] Zoledronic acid or another bisphosphonate may be
administered by any means that may result in the contact of
the active agent(s) with the desired site or site(s) of action in
the body of a patient. The compounds may be administered

amount per dose may be increased or decreased as treatment
progresses. The chosen dose may be administered one or
more times per week, monthly, every two months, every
three months, every six months, or every year.

[0239] In some embodiments, 60 mg of denosumab is
administered subcutaneously to patient in need of treatment
In some embodiments, the administration is repeated every
six months.

[0240] There are a number of ways that some part of
Compound 1 and/or Compound 2 may be removed from a
zoledronic acid product. For example, HPLC, preparative
TLC, crystallization, sublimation, or zone puriﬁcation may
be employed. Solvents that may be useful in HPLC, TLC, or
crystallization, may include, but are not limited to, water or
organic solvents, such as hexanes, diethyl ether, ethyl
acetate, methyl acetate, acetone, acetic acid, acetonitrile,
tetrahydrofuran, ethanol, methanol, isopropyl alcohol, chlo-
roform, diethyl ether, toluene, dimethylfomramide, benzene,
etc. Gradients, or two solvent systems may be employed as
well. For example, an HPLC separation may begin by
elution with water, after some time eluting with water, an
organic solvent, such as acetonitrile, methanol, ethanol,
ethyl acetate, acetone, acetic acid, methyl acetate, or another
solvent could gradually be added to the water, or may
replace the water entirely. Similarly, crystallization or
recrystallization may employ a single solvent, or a combi-
nation of solvents. For example, zoledronic acid or a salt
thereof, such as a disodium salt, might be recrystallized from
water, ethanol, methanol, diethyl ether, methyl acetate, ace-
tic acid, etc., or a combination of these solvents or others. In
some embodiments, zoledronic acid or a salt thereof, such as
a disodium salt, may be dissolved in one solvent, such as
water or acetic acid, and crystallized by a second solvent or
solvent system, such as hexane, diethyl ether, chloroform,
dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, methyl acetate. acetic acid,
ethanol, methanol, or a combination thereof In some
embodiments, a disodium salt of zoledronic acid is dissolved
in water, and then crystallized by adding hexane. In some
embodiments, a disodium salt of zoledronic acid is dissolved
in water, and then crystallized by adding diethyl ether. In
some embodiments, a disodium salt of zoledronic acid is
dissolved in water, and then crystallized by adding chloro-
form. In some embodiments, a disodium salt of zoledronic
acid is dissolved in water, and then crystallized by adding
dichloromethane. In some embodiments, a disodium salt of
zoledronic acid is dissolved in water, and then crystallized
by adding ethyl acetate. In some embodiments, a disodium
salt of zoledronic acid is dissolved in water, and then
crystallized by adding methyl acetate In some embodi-
ments, a disodium salt of zoledronic acid is dissolved in
water, and then crystallized by adding acetic acid. In some
embodiments, a disodium salt of zoledronic acid is dissolved
in water, and then crystallized by adding ethanol. In some
embodiments, a disodium salt of zoledronic acid is dissolved
in water, and then crystallized by adding methanol. For
embodiments employing water and a second solvent, the
ratio of water to the second solvent (water:second solvent)
may be about 1:100 to about 100:1, about 1:10 to about 1:5,
about 1:5 to about 1:4, about 1:4 to about 1:3, about 1:3 to
about 1:2, about 1:2 to about 1:1, about 1:1 to about 2:1,
about 2:1 to about 3:1, about 3:1 to about 4:1, about 4:1 to
about 5:1. or about 1:1 to about 10:1.

[0241] In some embodiments, a combination of two meth-
ods recited in the paragraph above may be employed, such

as HPLC or TLC and crystallization. In some embodiments,
a method may be repeated, such as HPLC, preparative TLC,
crystallization, sublimation, or zone puriﬁcation. In some
embodiments, a puriﬁcation method recited in the paragraph
above may be performed twice. In some embodiments. a
puriﬁcation method recited in the paragraph above may be
performed three or four times

[0242] Some oral dosage forms comprising zoledronic
acid or a salt thereof may have enteric coatings or ﬁlm
coatings.

Effect of Orally Administered Zoledronic Acid in Rat Model
of Inﬂammatory Pain

Method:

[0244] The effect of orally administered zoledronic acid
on inﬂammatory pain was examined using the rat complete
Freund’s adjuvant (CFA) model. Inﬂammatory pain was
induced by injection of 100% CFA in a 75 pL volume into
the left hind paws of Sprague-Dawley® rats on day 0,
followed by assessments on days 1-3. Animals were orally
administered vehicle (control), zoledronic acid 18 mg/m2 (or
3 mg/kg), zoledronic acid 120 mg/m2 (or 20 mg/kg), or
zoledronic acid 900 mg/m2 (or 150 mg/kg) daily on days
1-31 Drug was dissolved in distilled water and prepared fresh
daily. Animals were fasted prior to dosing Under current
FDA guidelines for extrapolating starting dosages from
animals to humans, dosages expressed in mg/m2 are con-
sidered equivalent between mammalian species. Thus, for
example, 18 mg/rn2 in a rat is considered equivalent to 18
mg/m2 in a human being, while 3 mg/kg in a rat may not be
equivalent to 3 mg/kg in a human being

[0245] Values for inﬂammatory pain (mechanical hyper-
algesia) in the vehicle and drug-treated animals were
obtained on day 0 prior to CFA injection, and at baseline and
post-treatment on days 1-3. Pain was assessed using a digital
Randall-Selitto device (dRS; IITC Life Sciences, Woodland
Hills, Calif.). Animals were placed in a restraint sling that
suspended the animal, leaving the hind limbs available for
testing. Paw compression threshold was measured by apply-
ing increasing pressure to the plantar surface of the hind paw
with a dome-shaped tip placed between the 3rd and 4th
metatarsus. Pressure was applied gradually over approxi-
mately 10 seconds. Measurements were taken from the ﬁrst
observed nocifensive behavior of vocalization, struggle or
withdrawal. A cut-OE value of 300 g was used to prevent
injury to the animal.

[0246] Reversal of inﬂammatory pain was calculated
according to the formula:

% reversal=(PostrtreatrnentrPostrCFA baseline)/(Prer
CFA baselinerPostrCFA baseline)x100.

[0247] The experiment was carried out using 9-10 animals
per group.
Results:

[0248] Oral administration of zoledronic acid signiﬁcantly
improved inﬂammatory pain thresholds compared to

vehicle. Pain threshold measurements taken at various times
are shown in FIG. 1. Paw compression thresholds in the 18
mg/m2 group were higher than for vehicle during the entire
measurement period after 30 minutes from the start of
treatment. On day three, paw compression thresholds for
both the 18 mg/m2 and 900 mg/m2 groups were greater than
for vehicle. An improvement in pain threshold of 49% and
83% from baseline was observed for the 18 mg/m2 and the
900 mg/m2 groups respectively.

[0249] Orally administered zoledronic acid produced a
29% reversal of inﬂammatory pain at the 18 mg/m2, and a
48% reversal at the 900 mg/m2 dose. This magnitude of
effect is comparable to that obtained with clinical doses of
commercially available NSAIDs when tested in a similar
model of inﬂammatory pain. Under current FDA guidelines,
the reference body surface area of a human adult is 1.62 m2.
Thus, a daily dose of 18 mg/m2 corresponds to a monthly
dose of about 500-560 mg/m2 or a human dose of about
800-900 mg.

[0250] Surprisingly, the two higher doses resulted in
thresholds that were lower than vehicle on the ﬁrst two days
of dosing. The 120 mg/m2 group was approximately equal or
inferior to vehicle at all time points during the assessment
period. While the 900 mg/m2 group showed eifectiveness on
day 3, this result was accompanied by signiﬁcant toxicity
necessitating euthanization of all the animals in this group
two days after cessation of dosing.

Example 2

Eﬁect of Orally Administered Zoledronic Acid in Rat Model
of Arthritis Pain

Method:

[0251] The eﬁect of orally administered zoledronic acid
on arthritis pain was examined in the rat complete Freund’s
adjuvant (CFA) model of arthritis pain. In this model,
injection of 100% complete Freund’s adjuth (CFA) in a 75
[AL volume into the left hind paws is followed by a 10-14 day
period to allow for the development of arthritis pain. Ani-
mals were orally administered vehicle (control), zoledronic
acid 54 mg/m2 (or 9 mg/kg), or zoledronic acid 360 mg/m2
(or 60 mg/kg), divided in three equal daily doses on the ﬁrst
three days post CFA injection. Drug was dissolved in
distilled water and prepared fresh daily. Animals were fasted
prior to dosing.

[0252] Arthritis pain (mechanical hyperalgesia) in the
vehicle and drug-treated animals was evaluated on day 14
post CFA injection using a digital Randall-Selitto device
(dRS; IITC Life Sciences, Woodland Hills, Calif.) Animals
were placed in a restraint sling that suspended the animal,
leaving the hind limbs available for testing. Paw compres-
sion threshold was measured by applying increasing pres-
sure to the plantar surface of the hind paw with a dome-
shaped tip placed between the 3rd and 4th metatarsus.
Pressure was applied gradually over approximately 10 sec-
onds. Measurements were taken from the ﬁrst observed
nocifensive behavior of vocalization, struggle or with-
drawal. A cut-OE value of 300 g was used to prevent injury
to the animal.

Jan. 31, 2019

[0253] Reversal of arthritis pain in the ipsilateral (CFA-
injected) paw was calculated according to the formula:

% maisai:<apsuatmi drug threshold—ipsilateral
vehicle Lhreshold)/(contralateral vehicle threshr
oldrlpsilateral vehicle Lhreshold)x100.

[0254] The experiment was carried out using 7-10 animals
per group.

Results:

[0255] Oral administration of zoledronic acid signiﬁcantly
improved arthritis pain thresholds compared to vehicle. As
shown in FIGS. 2A and 2B, orally administered zoledronic
acid produced a dose-dependent reversal of arthritis pain. A
reversal of 33% was observed in the 54 mg/m2 group, and
reversal of 54% was observed in the 360 mg/m2 group.
Under current FDA guidelines, the reference body surface
area ofa human adult is 1.62 1112. Thus, 54 mym2 in a rat is
equivalent to an implied human dose of about 87 mg, and
360 mg/m2 in a rat is equivalent to an implied human dose
of about 583 mg.

Example 3. Treatment of Complex Regional Pain
Syndrome with Orally Administered Zoledronic
Acid

[0256] The effect of orally administered zoledronic acid
was examined in the rat tibia fracture model of complex
regional pain syndrome (CRPS). CRPS was induced in the
rats by fracturing the right distal tibias of the animals and
casting the fractured hindpaws for 4 weeks, as described in
Guo T 2 et a]. (Pain. 2004; 108: 95-107). This animal model
has been shown to replicate the inciting trauma (such as a
fracture, a surgery, a crushing injury, a cutting injury, a
scratch, or a puncture injury), natural history, signs, symp-
toms, and pathologic changes observed in human CRPS
patients (Kingery W S et a1., Pain. 2003; 104:75-84).
[0257] Animals were orally administered either vehicle
(control) or zoledronic acid, in a dosage of 18 mg/mz/day (3
mg/kg/day) for 28 days, starting on the day of fracture anc
casting. Drug was dissolved in distilled water and adminis-
tered by gavage. Animals were fasted for 4 hours before an
2 hours after dosing. At the end of the 28-day period, casts
were removed, and on the following day, the rats were testec
for hindpaw pain, edema, and warmth.

Pain Assessments

[0258] Pain was assessed by measuring hyperalgesia, anc
weight bearing.

[0259] To measure hyperalgesia, an up-down von Frey
testing paradigm was used. Rats were placed in a clear
plastic cylinder (20 cm in diameter) with a wire mesh bottom
and allowed to acclimate for 15 minutes. The paw was testec
with one of a series of eight von Frey hairs ranging in
stiffness from 0.41 g to 15.14 g. The von Frey hair was
applied against the hindpaw plantar skin at approximately
midsole, taking care to avoid the tori pads. The ﬁber was
pushed until it slightly bowed and then it was jiggled in that
position for 6 seconds. Stimuli were presented at an interva
of several seconds. Hindpaw withdrawal from the ﬁber was
considered a positive response. The initial ﬁber presentation
was 2.1 g and the ﬁbers were presented according to the
up-down method of Dixon to generate six responses in the
immediate vicinity of the 50% threshold. Stimuli were
presented at an interval of several seconds.

placebo treatment. Furthermore, the patients receiving zole-
dronic acid reported NSAID use at one year signiﬁcantly
less often than those in the placebo group. Overall, the
improvements in most of the evaluated parameters were
greater in the zoledronic acid group throughout the follow-
up period.

[0290] The clinical characteristics of study participants at
baseline are displayed in Table 6. The mean LBP duration
was 293 days, initial LBP intensity on VAS 6.7, leg pain on
VAS 2.9 and the ODl score was 32%. Altogether 19 patients
in the ZA group and 18 in the placebo group had a M1/2
lesion. Modic changes were most commonly (70%) situated
at L4/5 or L5/S1. The zoledronic acid and placebo groups
were similar as regards the demographic and background
characteristics of all patients at baseline (Table 6B).

[0291] The mean difference (MD) between the treatment
groups in the primary outcome, intensity of LBP, signiﬁ-
cantly favored zoledronic acid at one month (MD 1.4; 95%
Cl 0.01 to 2.9) while at one year no signiﬁcant difference
was observed (MD 0.7; 95% Cl —l.0 to 2.4; Table 7). The
proportion of patients with at least 20% improvement in
intensity of LBP and PASS both favored the zoledronic acid
treatment at one month: zoledronic acid 55% vs, placebo
25% (p:01105) and zoledronic acid 50% vs. placebo 20%
(p:0.096), respectively,

[0292] For the patients who were treated with zoledronjc
acid, the reduction in pain intensity was greater in those with
greater baseline pain intensity as shown in Table 9. The
mean reduction in pain from baseline was 3.4 for patients
with baseline pain intensity 27, as compared to a reduction
of only 0.1 for patients with a baseline pain intensity <6.

[0293] Of the secondary outcomes, the improvement in
ODl, favored zoledronic acid at 1 month, the adjusted
between-group difference being 6.0% (95% Cl —0.6 to 13),
but not at one year (Table 7). Similarly, side bending (to right
and left) favored the zoledronic acid treatment at one month
but not at one year (Table 7). Changes in total RAND-36,
and in the physical and mental components of RAND-36 are
shown in Table Si

[0294] At baseline, there were no differences in self-
reported use of non-steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs) between the treatment groups, Whereas at one
year, only 20% of patients in the ZA group used NSAle
versus 60% in the placebo group,

Methods

[0285] A study was performed to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg ZA in comparison with
intravenous placebo infusion among patients with chronic
low back pain (LBP) and Modic changes on MRI. This study
was a double-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled clini-
cal trial in patients with low back pain (LBP) Patients were
included in the study if they had low back symptoms for at
least three months, a LBP of at least six (6) on a lO-cm
Visual Analog Scale (VAS) or an Oswestry Disability Index
(ODI) of at least 30%, and an M1, mixed Ml/2 or M2 type
change on MRI performed within six months at most prior
to enrolment,

[0286] Patients were excluded from the study if they had
renal impairment with reduced creatinine clearance deﬁned
as an estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR) below 40
ml/min, hypocalcemia, known hypersensitivity to zole-
dronic acid or other bisphosphonates or ingredients of the
infusion product, the presence of red ﬂags, nerve root
entrapment or willingness for early retirement, Premeno-
pausal women of childbearing potential were also excluded.
Blood samples were taken prior to the infusion to assess the
serum concentration of calcium and creatinine. The clinical
examination included medical history and clinical assess-
ment of lumbar ﬂexibility, tendon signs, and motor and
sensory testing,

[0287] After conﬁrmation of eligibility patients were ran-
domized to receive a single intravenous infusion of 5 mg
Zoledronic acid (n:20) or 100 ml saline as placebo (n:20)
over a 15-minute period. Information on use of the con-
comitant medication and hospital admissions were recorded,
Blood samples were taken for the assessment of safety,
inﬂammatory mediators and markers of bone turnover at
baseline, one month and one yean

[0288] Clinical assessments were performed 14 days
before enrolment (screening visit), and follow-up visits at
one month and one year after the infusion. The primary
outcome was the change in the intensity of LBP on VAS,
Secondary outcomes included leg pain intensity, ODI,
health-related quality of life assessed with RAND-36,
patient-reported sick leaves and lumbar ﬂexibility These
outcome measures were assessed at baseline and at each
follow-up, Lumbar ﬂexibility was evaluated using the ﬁn-
gers-to-ﬂoor and trunk side bending measures (in cm). The
percentage of patients undergoing a 20% relative improve-
ment, the proportion of patients reaching a VAS score of 40
or less in the primary outcome, and patient acceptable
symptom state (PASS) were also assessed. Pain medication
use was inquired about during the follow-up visits,

Results

[0289] Zoledronic acid treatment resulted in a greater
improvement in LBP intensity at one month as compared to

[0304] To 1,3-bis(2-n1ethoxy-2-oxoethyl)-1H-imidazol-3-
ium chloride (9; 41.00 g, 164,88 mrnol, 1 eq) was added
37% aq. HCl (3003 mL, 362.74 mmol, 2.2 eq.). The mixture
was stirred under reﬂux for 0.5 hour. The mixture was
concentrated and the remaining solid was washed with
acetone (2x200 mL) and Et20 (3x200 mL), Drying in vacuo
gave 10 (31.89 g, 144,55 mmol, 87.7%) as a white solid.
[0305] Compound 1:

[0306] Compound 10 is reacted with an equimolar amount
of phosphorous acid, followed by an equimolar amount of
phosphorous trichloride, and an excess of water to form
Compound 1, which is precipitated from ethanol.

[0307] Compound 2:

[0308] 1,3-Bis(carboxymethyl)-1H-imidazol-3-ium chlo-
ride (10, 2.00 g, 9 mmol, 10 eq) and H31)O3 (7.37 g, 90
mmol, 10 eq) were dissolved in toluene (10 mL) and heated
to 70° C. The reaction mixture was stirred at this tempera-
ture for 20 min before PC]3 (16 mL, 180 mmol, 20 eq) was
added within 30 min, The reaction mixture was then heated
to 95° C. and stirred at this temperature for 2 h. Then, aq.
HCl (30 mL, 37% HCl and 5 mL HZO) was added. The
reaction mixture was heated to 100° C. and stirred at this
temperature for 7 h, then stirred at room temperature for 2
days and ﬁltered. The ﬁltrate was cooled in an ice bath and
added within 45 min to absolute EtOH (90 mL). The
resulting turbid solution was stirred for 1 h at room tem-
perature before the solid was ﬁltered off. The ﬁlter cake
(Compound 2) was isolated and analyzed by 2D-NMR
spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (m/F477). The ﬁltrate
was concentrated in vacuo to give a residue. This residue
(500 mg) was treated with aq. NaOH (150 mg in 3.5 mL of
HZO) and EtOH (7 mL). After standing overnight the liquid
was decanted and the resulting solid (Na salt of Compound
2) was obtained and analyzed by NMR and mass spectrom-
etry (m/z:477).

US 2019/0030051 A1

[0260] An incapacitance device (IITC Inc. Life Science,
Woodland, Calif, USA) was used to measure hindpaw
weight bearing, a postural eﬂect of pain. The rats were
manually held in a vertical position over the apparatus with
the hindpaws resting on separate metal scale plates and the
entire weight of the rat was supported on the hindpaws. The
duration of each measurement was 6 seconds and 10 con-
secutive measurements were taken at 60-second intervals.
Eight readings (excluding the highest and lowest ones) were
averaged to calculate the bilateral hindpaw weight-bearing
values. Weight bearing data were analyzed as the ratio
between right (fracture) and left hindpaw weight bearing
values ((2R/(R+L))><100%).

Edema Assessment

[026]] A laser sensor technique was used to determine the
dorsal-ventral thickness of the hindpaw. Before baseline
testing the bilateral hindpaws were tattooed with a 2 to 3 mm
spot on the dorsal skin over the midpoint of the third
metatarsal. For laser measurements each rat was brieﬂy
anesthetized with isoﬂurane and then held vertically so the
hindpaw rested on a table top below the laser. The paw was
gently held ﬂat on the table with a small metal rod applied
to the top of the ankle joint. Using optical triangulation, a
laser with a distance measuring sensor was used to deter-
mine the distance to the table top and to the top of the
hindpaw at the tattoo site and the diﬁerence was used to
calculate the dorsal-ventral paw thickness. The measure-
ment sensor device used in these experiments (4381 Preci-
cura, Limab, Goteborg, Sweden) has a measurement range
of 200 mm with a 001 mm resolution

Hindpaw Temperature Measurement

[0262] The temperature of the hindpaw was measured
using a ﬁne wire thermocouple (Omega, Stanford, Conn,
USA) applied to the paw skin. Six sites were tested per
hindpaw. The six measurements for each hindpaw were
averaged for the mean temperature.

Results

[0263] As illustrated in FIG. 3, treatment with orally
administered zoledronic acid reversed pain, restored weight
bearing, and prevented edema as compared to vehicle treated
animals,

[0264] As illustrated in FIG 4, von Frey pain thresholds
for the right (fracture) hindpaw were reduced by 72% versus
the contralateral (normal) hindpaw in vehicle treated arri-
mals. Zoledronate treatment reversed fracture induced pain
by 77% as compared to vehicle treatment.

[0265] As illustrated in FIG. 5, reduction in weight bear-
ing, a postural effect of pain, was signiﬁcantly higher in the
vehicle treated group as compared to the zoledronic acid
treated group. Weight bearing on the fracture hindlimb was
reduced to 55% of normal in the vehicle treated group.
Zoledronate treatment signiﬁcantly restored hindlimb
weight bearing as compared to vehicle treatment (86% of
normal).

[0266] As illustrated in FIG. 6, the expected increase in
hindpaw thickness was greater in the vehicle treated group
as compared to the zoledronic acid treated group, reﬂecting
the development of edema. Zoledronate treatment reduced
hindpaw edema by 60% versus vehicle treatment.

Jan. 3], 2019

[0267] Zoledronic acid reduced hindpaw warmth by 5%
versus vehicle treatment.

[0268] The daily dose in the above experiment was 18
mg/mZ/dayi Under current FDA guidelines, the reference
body surface area of a human adult is 162 m2. Thus, a daily
dose of 18 mg/m2 corresponds to a monthly dose of about
500-560 mg/m2 or a human dose of about 800-900 mg.

Example 4. Solubility of Disodium Salt of
Zoledronic Acid

[0269] The aqueous solubility of zoledronic acid and
disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate was determined. One
gram of the test compound was measured in to a beaker,
Demineralized water (pH 5.5) was then added in small
increments to the test compound, and sonication was applied
to the mixture. The procedure was continued until complete
dissolution was achieved. Full dissolution was determined to
have been reached when a clear solution was present with no
visible material. The volume of water required to reach full
dissolution was used to calculate a solubility value
expressed in grams per 100 mL. The procedure was per-
formed for each compound

Results

[0270] As shown in FIG. 7, the aqueous solubility of
disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate is approximately 50 times
that of zoledronic acid, Disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate
has a solubility of 12.5 g/100 mL compared to only 0.25
g/ 100 mL for zoledronic acid.

Example 5. Bioavailability of Orally Administered
Zoledronic Acid and Disodium Zoledronate

[0271] Tablets were manufactured containing either pure
zoledronic acid or the disodium salt of zoledronic acid
(disodium zoledronate tetrahydrate). Both types of tablets
contained 50 mg of zoledronic acid equivalent per tablet.
Identical excipients were used in both types of tablets, with
amounts adjusted to account for the difference in molecular
weights between the acid and the disodium salt.

[0272] Beagle dogs were orally administered tablets con-
taining 150 mg zoledronic acid equivalent either in the form
of disodium zoledronate (Group 1) or pure zoledronic acid
(Group 2). Each animal was given three 50 mg equivalent
tablets (150 mg total), which were administered together,
The animal’s oral cavity was wetted with water before
placing the tablets on the back of the animal’s tongue.
Animals were fasted before and after dosing. Animals were
6 to 9 months of age and weighed 6 to 10 kg on the day of
dosing. There were three dogs per group.

[0273] Serial blood samples were collected from each
animal by venipuncture of the jugllar vein at various points
alter dosing for measurement of plasma concentrations of
zoledronic acid. Blood samples were collected into chilled
tubes containing KZEDTA as the anticoagulant. Samples
were then centrifuged at approximately 3000 rpm at +4° C,
for 10 minutes for plasma derivation. Plasma concentrations
of zoledronic acid were measured using an LC/MS/MS
method.

Results

[0274] The average plasma concentrations of zoledronic
acid for each group of dogs is summarized in Table 1 and
US 2019/0030051 A1

illustrated in FIG, 8. Detectable plasma levels of zoledronic
acid were observed for the entire 48 hours that they were
measured.

[0275] Disodiurn zoledronate produced signiﬁcantly

higher plasma levels of zoledronic acid than pure zoledronic
acid, indicating improved oral absorption with the salt form.
Measured using peak plasma concentrations (Cum), the
disodium salt resulted in a 119% actual and 74% weight-
adjusted increase in bioavailability as compared to pure
zoledronic acid. Measured using area under the plasma
concentration curve (AUCDM), bioavailability was 84% and
46% greater with the disodium salt than with pure zole-
dronic aci , on an actual and weight-adjusted basis respec-
tively. The average AUCOJ, for the disodium salt was 4073
ng‘h/mL and the average AUCDm for the diacid was 2217
ng~h/rnL. The AUCOM was found to be close proportional
Thus, for beagle dogs similar to those tested, about 3 mg to
about 4 mg of the disodium salt would be expected to result
in an AUCOM of about 100 ng'h/mL, and about 7 mg to about
8 mg of the disodium salt would be expected to result in an
AUCDm 0 about 200 ng‘h/mL.

Example 6. Hardness of Tablets Comprising
Zolecronic Acid in the Free Acid and Disodium
Salt Forms

[0276] Tablets were prepared by blending zoledronic acid,
either in the form of the free acid or the disodium salt, with
identical excipients. For dosage forms with a greater amount
of active, tie amount of the excipients was reduced propor-
tionally to keep the weight of the tablet at about 100 mg.
After blenc ing, the ingredients were compressed at varying
pressures, followed by a ﬁlm coating. The resulting tablets
were then tested for hardness using a Dr. Schleuniger
Pharmatron 8M Tablet Hardness Tester. The results are
shown in Table 2 and FIG. 9.

Example 7. Eifects of Zoledronic Acid on Patients
with Osteoarthritis and BML

[0277] Some embodiments related to joint pain, bone
marrow lesions, and osteoarthritis were conceived as a result
of analyzing data from a clinical study. Some of the results
of this study were reported by Laslett et al. in Arm Rheum
Dis 2012; 71:1322-1328. Some of the description and data
reported below was not published prior to ﬁling the present
application. Fiﬁy-two (52) patients with clinical knee
osteoarthritis and knee bone marrow lesions (BML) were
randomized to receive either intravenous zoledronic acid (5
mg) or placebo in a double blind fashion. All patients had to
have at least one bone marrow lesion (BML) in the aﬂected
knee on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). All patients
had x-ray of the knee for determination of joint space
narrowing (JSN), which was graded according to the
Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) atlas.
Patients had either no joint space narrowing (OARSI Grade
0). or greater degrees of joint space narrowing (OARSI
Grade 1 and Grade 2). Twenty six patients were treated with
zoledronic acid (8, 6, and 12 with OARSI Grades 0, l, and
2, respectively). Twenty six patients received placebo (8, 8,
and 10 with OARSI Grades 0, 1 and 2, respectively).

[0278] Pain intensity was assessed, at baseline and at three
months, using a 100 mm visual analog scale (VAS), with
zero representing no pain and 100 representing extreme
pain. The change in pain intensity from baseline to 3 months
was calculated.

[0279] With zoledronic acid treatment, pain was reduced
signiﬁcantly as compared to placebo in patients with no joint
space narrowing (OARSI Grade 0), but not in patients with
joint space narrowing (OARSI Grades 1-2). As shown in
Table 3 and FIG. 10, average VAS scores were reduced by
15 mm as compared to placebo in the OARSI Grade 0 group,
but only by 0.28 as compared to placebo in patients with
OARSI Grades 1-2,

[0280] In the zoledronic acid group, average VAS scores at
3 months decreased from baseline by approximately 25 mm
and 21 mm in patients with OARSI Grades 0 and 1,
respectively, but only by 9 mm in the OARSI Grade 2
patients (FIG. 11).

Methods:

[0295] A study was performed to evaluate the efﬁcacy of
bisphosphonates such as oral zoledronic acid in inhibiting
immune responses and pain behavior in a rat fracture model
of CRPS,

[0296] The effect of orally administered zoledronic acid
was examined in the rat tibia fracture model of complex
regional pain syndrome (CRPS), CRPS was induced in the
rats by fracturing the right distal tibias of the animals and
casting the fractured hindpaws for 4 weeks, as described in
Guo T Z et a1, (Pain. 2004; 108: 95-107), This animal model
has been shown to replicate the inciting trauma (such as a
fracture, a surgery, a cmshing injury, a cutting injury, a
scratch, or a puncture injury), natural history, signs, symp-
toms, and pathologic changes observed in human CRPS
patients (Kingery W S et al., Pain, 2003; 104:75-84)
[0297] Starting four weeks after fracture and casting,
animals were orally administered either vehicle (control) or
zoledronic acid, a dose of 21 mg/kg on the ﬁrst day and 3

mg/kg/day daily thereaﬁer, or distilled water for 3 weeks
(weeks 4-7 post-fracture). Drug was dissolved in distilled
water and administered by gavage. Animals were fasted for
4 hours before and 2 hours after dosing, At the end of the
21-day period, casts were removed, and on the following
day, the rats were tested for hindpaw pain, edema, and
warmth.

Results

[0298] As illustrated in FIGS 14-15, treatment with orally
administered zoledronic acid reversed pain and restored
weight bearing as compared to the vehicle treated animals.
[0299] As illustrated in FIG, 14, von Frey pain thresholds
for the right (fracture) hindpaw were reduced by over 100%
as compared to baseline when oral zoledronic acid was
administered,

[0300] As illustrated in FIG. 15, reduction in weight
bearing, a postural eﬁect of pain, was signiﬁcantly higher in
the vehicle treated group as compared to the zoledronic acid
treated group. Weight bearing on the fracture hindlimb was
reduced to about 80% of normal in the vehicle treated group,
Zoledronate treatment signiﬁcantly restored hindlirnb
weight bearing as compared to vehicle treatment (over 90%
of normal).

[0301] As can be seen in FIG. 16, orally administering
zoledronic acid four weeks aﬁer the fracture resulted in
signiﬁcantly greater improvement of pain relief as compared
to administration at the time of injury,

referred to as vertebral endplate signal changes (VESC),
Modic changes, can be classiﬁed into various types includ-
ing type 1 (M1), type 2 (M2), and type 3 (M3) lesions or
changes, any of which may be treated using an osteoclast
inhibitor, such as a nitrogen-bisphosphonate, including, eg.
zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, etcr Different types of
Modic changes may occur in the same patient, for example
type 1 and type 2 Modic changes (Ml/2), In some cases, Ml
changes are related to lower back pain than other types of
Modic change.

[0120] VESCs may be found in patients with different
types of low back pain including but not limited to spon-
dylitis, trauma, spondyloarthropathies including ankylosing
spondylitis, Schrnorl’s nodes, fracture, tumor, and spinal
cord infarction. Lesions in ankylosing spondylitis include
osteitis and spondylodiscitis, which can be detected using
MRI or another medical imaging instrument.

[0121] Modic changes may be found in the cervical,
thoracic, lumbar, and sacral spine. Modic changes may be
found at various spinal levels such as at C1/2, C2/3, C3/4,
C4/5, C5/6, C6/7, C7/T1, T1/2, T2/3, T3/4, T4/5, T5/6, T6/7,

the patient being treated has is M2.

[0127] In some embodiments, the patient being treated has
Modic changes at more two or more levels, In some embodi-
ments the patient being treated has Modic changes at three
or more levels, In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes at two
levels, or three or more levels, than is obtained when treating
a patient with Modic changes at a single level or at two
levels.

Jan. 31, 2019

[0128] In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes at two
levels than is obtained when treating a patient with Modic
changes at a single level.

[0129] In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes at three
or more levels than is obtained when treating a patient with
Modic changes at a single level,

[0130] In some embodiments greater pain relief is
obtained when treating a patient with Modic changes three
or more levels than is obtained when treating a patient with
Modic changes at two levels.

[0131] In some embodiments, the inhibitor of osteoclast
activity may be used to effect a reduction in the levels of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines in the patient with low back
pain or any other type of pain or condition recited herein. In
some embodiments greater pain relief may be obtained in
patients with greater baseline levels of pro-inﬂammatory
cytokines when treated with an inhibitor of osteoclast activ-
ity, such as a nitrogen-containing bisphosphonate, including
erg. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid, etc, In some embodi-
ments, greater pain relief may be obtained in patients who
experience a reduction or a greater reduction in the levels of
pro-inﬂammatory cytokines when treated with an inhibitor
of osteoclast activity, such as a nitrogen-containing bispho-
sphonate, including erg. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid,
etcr Pro-inﬂammatory cytokines include but are not limited
to IL-1, IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-l2, tumor necrosis
alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon gannna, etc.

[0132] In some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of
osteoclast activity, such as a nitrogen-containing bisphos-
phonate, including eg. zoledronic acid, minodronic acid,
etc., to a patient or mammal in need thereof, achieves a
reduction relative to baseline in the size of Modic changes
or VESCs of at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least
about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at least
about 30%, at least about 40%, at least about 50%, at least
about 60%, at least about 70% at least about 80%, at least
about 90%, or about 100%. In some embodiments, the
reduction the size of Modic changes or VESCs represents an
improvement relative to placebo of at least about 10%, at
least about 15%, at least about 20%, at least about 25%, at
least about 30%, at last about 40%, at least about 50%, at
least about 60%, at least about 70%, at least about 80%, at
least about 90%, at least about 100%, at least about 120%,
at least about 150%, at least about 170%, at least about
200%, at least about 250%, at least about 300%, at least
about 350%, at least about 400%, or at least about 450%, In
some embodiments, the use of an inhibitor of osteoclast
activity inhibits an increase in the size of Modic changes or
VESCs over time.

[0133] The oral bioavailability of zoledronic acid may be
enhanced by orally administering the zoledronic acid in the
disodium salt form. For example, the bioavailability of
zoledronic acid may be improved by at least about 10%, at
least about 20%, at least about 30%, at least about 50%,
and/or up to about 100%, or up to about 200%, as compared
to administration of zoledronic acid in the diacid form.
[0134] Because of the improved bioavailability of the
disodium salt a dosage fomi may contain, or a mammal,
such as a human being, may receive, on a molar basis, less
of the disodium salt form of zoledronic acid than would
otherwise be administered of the diacid form of zoledronic
acid. For example, a dosage form may contain, or a mammal

may receive, at least about 10 mole % less, at least about 20
mole % less, at least about 40 mole % less, at least about 50
mole % less, and/or up to about 90 mole % less or 95 mole
% less, of the disodium salt form as compared the amount
of the diacid form of zoledronic acid that would otherwise
be administered, such as a molar amount that would be
administered of zoledronic acid in the diacid form in order
to achieve the same plasma levels of zoledronic acid.

[0135] In some embodiments, a dosage form contains, or
a mammal (such as a human being) is administered, an
amount of the disodium salt form, on a molar basis, that has
a value of about 0.8nd to about 1.2nd or about 0.9nd to about
1.1 nd, wherein:

nf(b/bd)(na)

wherein bu is the bioavailability of the diacid form, bd is the
bioavailability of the disodium salt form, and n, is the
number of moles of the diacid that would be administered in
a dosage form containing the diacid form of zoledronic acid,
For example, if the diacid form has a bioavailability (be) of
0,01 and the disodium salt form has a bioavailability (bd) of
0,015, and a dosage form would normally contain 0,001
moles ofthe diacid, “a would be (0.01/0.015)(0,001 moles),
or about 0.00067 moles. In some embodiments, the diso-
dium salt is administered in an amount that has a value of
about nd,

[0136] With respect to oral dosage forms comprising a
reduced molar amount of the disodium salt of zoledronic
acid as compared to the diacid form of zoledronic acid, in
some embodiments, the bioavailability of the zoledronic
acid in the disodium salt form is suﬁiciently high that, if the
drug is administered to a mammal, at least as much zole-
dronic acid is present in the blood of the mammal as would
be present if zoledronic acid were administered in the diacid
form

[0137] With respect to oral dosage forms comprising the
disodium salt form of zoledronic acid, in some embodi-
ments, the disodium salt form is present in a lower molar
amount than would be present if the zoledronic acid were in
the diacid form; and the zoledronic acid in the disodium salt
form has an improved bioavailability as compared to the
zoledronic acid in the diacid form to the extent that the lower
molar amount of the disodium salt in the dosage form does
not reduce the amount of zoledronic acid delivered to the
plasma of a mammal,

[0138] Some oral dosage forms comprising zoledronic
acid have a dose of zoledronic acid and a conﬁguration
suitable for a particular species of mammal, eig, dog, rat,
human, etc. Such a dosage form may have zoledronic acid
present in an amount that results in a desired range for an
area under the plasma concentration curve (AUC) of zole-
dronic acid in that particular species of mammal. For
example the dose of zoledronic acid and a conﬁguration of
the oral dosage form may result in an AUC of zoledronic
acid of about 1 ng'h/mL to about 700 ng~h/mL, about 3
ng'h/mL to about 30 ng~h/mL, about 3 ng'h/mL to about 10
ng'h/mL, about 50 ng'h/mL to about 700 ng~h/mL, about 130
ng‘h/mL to about 180 ng‘h/mL, about 300 ng‘h/mL to about
450 ng‘h/mL, about 300 ng‘h/mL to about 350 ng‘h/mL,
about 300 ng-h/mL to about 310 ng~h/mL, about 340 ng-h/

any AUC in a range bounded by, or between. any of these
values, upon administration of the oral dosage form to a
mammal

[0139] Unless otherwise indicated, the AUC refers to the
AUC calculated to the last measured concentration (AUC
(04)) and extrapolated to inﬁnity (AUCwWﬂ),

[0140] An oral dosage form comprising zoledronic acid
having a dose of zoledronic acid and a conﬁguration suitable
for a particular species of mammal may have zoledronic acid
present in an amount that results in a C"WC of zoledronic acid
of about 0.2 ng/mL to about 300 ng/mL, about 0.5 ng/mL to
about 5 ng/mL, about 5 ng/mL to about 300 ng/mL, about 5
ng/mL to about 50 ng/mL, about 20 ng/mL to about 50
ng/mL, about 30 ng/mL to about 50 ng/mL, about 50 ng/mL
to about 200 ng/mL, about 50 ng/mL to about 150 ng/mL,
about 80 ng/mL to about 120 ng/mL, about 90 ng/mL to
about 100 ng/mL, about 50 ng/mL to about 200 ng/mL,
about 40 ng/mL, about 95 ng/mL, about 97 ng/mL, or any
Cm“ in a range bounded by, or between, any of these values,
upon administration of the oral dosage form to a mammal.
[0141] An oral dosage form comprising zoledronic acid
having a dose of zoledronic acid and a conﬁguration suitable
for a particular species of mammal may be conﬁgured so that
administration of the oral dosage form to the particular
species of mammal results in a Tm, of zoledronic acid of
about 0.4 hr to about 1 hr, about 0.5 hr, or about 0.75 hr, or
any Tm” in a range bounded by, or between, any of these
values.

[0142] In some embodiments, the zoledronic acid in the
disodium salt form is present in an amount such that the oral
dosage form provides an area under the plasma concentra-
tion curve of zoledronic acid of about 4 ng~h/mL to about
2000 ng-h/mL to the mammal each time the zoledronic acid
in the disodium salt is administered,

[0143] In some embodiments, the zoledronic acid, includ-
ing zoledronic acid in an acid or a salt form, e.g the disodium
salt form, is present in an amount such that the oral dosage
form provides an area under the plasma concentration curve
of zoledronic acid of about 100 ng-h/mL to about 2000
ngh’mL, about 100 ng-h/mL to about 1000 nglh/mL, about
500 ng-h/mL to about 1000 ng~h/mL, or about 500 ng~h/mL
to about 700 ng‘h/mL in the mammal to which the dosage
form is administered. This amount may be suitable for
administration of the oral dosage form about every 3 to 4
weeks.

[0144] In some embodiments, the zoledronic acid, such as
zoledronic acid in an acid form or a salt form, such as the
disodium salt form, is present in an amount such that the oral
dosage form provides an area under the plasma concentra-
tion curve (AUC) of zoledronic acid ofabout 20 nglh/mL to
about 700 ng~h/mL, about 50 ng-h/mL to about 500 ng-h/mL,
about 50 ng~h/mL to about 400 ng‘h/mL, about 50 ng‘h/mL

hereby incorporated herein by reference in their entireties.

BACKGROUND

[0002] The superﬁcial layers of the skins and mucous
membranes of humans and other animals play host to a
variety of microorganisms, including numerous species of
fungi and bacteria. Balance between skin ﬂora and the host
organisms is normally maintained at a steady level, but
uncontrolled fungal growth occurs regularly in the obese, in
diabetics, and in immunocompromised individuals such as
cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy, HIV positive
persons, and transplant recipients taking anti-rejection
drugs, among others.

[0003] Candida albicans occurs naturally on the body,
particularly in warm, moist areas. Intertrigo is an over-
growth of Candida yeast in areas such as the groin, armpits,
between the buttocks, under heavy breasts, the inner thighs,
the perianal area, the genital area, between the toes, the
crease of the neck, between abdominal fat folds, and other
body surfaces. Intertrigo also presents as diaper rash. Over-
growth ofyeasts such as Candida is particularly problematic
in institutional settings; prevalence ranges from 6% of
hospital patients to 17% of those residing in nursing homes.
Up to 20% of home-bound patients also experience topical
yeast imbalances. Any persons experiencing restricted
mobility may be at increased risk for intertrigo. Other
contributing factors include incontinence, heat, humid
weather, tight clothing, lack of air circulation, friction
between skin folds, excessive sweating, poor hygiene, mal-
nutrition, inﬂamrnatory skin conditions such as psoriasis,
and the use of topical steroids.

[0004] Candida] diaper dermatitis (diaper rash) is a com-
mon yeast overgrowth infection caused by C. albicans that
frequently presents in the perianal area and between the
buttocks of infants and toddlers. Visits to outpatient pediatric
oﬁices for diaper rash total one million per year in the United
States. The skin of infants is thinner than that of adults and
produces fewer secretions. Thus, infant skin is more sus-
ceptible to irritation and infection. Measures such as fre-
quent diaper changes, avoidance of moisture-impervious
diaper covers, and leaving children for long periods of time
without diapers can help prevent diaper rash. However,
topical antifungal therapy is still necessary for the resolution
of candida] diaper rash.

[0005] Symptoms of Candida imbalance include redness,
irritation, intense itching, burning, pain, and odor. Physi-
cians oﬁen prescribe combination steroid/antifungal creams
such as Mycolog (nystatin/triamcinolone), Lotrisone (clotri-
mazolejbetamethasone), or Vytone (iodoquinol/hydrocorti-
sone), to intertrigo patients. While these rapidly relieve
symptoms, fungal resurgence after corticosteroid treatment
is common. These recurrences of symptoms often exceed the

Jan. 3], 2019

initial presentation. Although triamcinolone, betamethasone,
and hydrocortisone provide inunediate relief of symptoms,
they also suppress the body’s own immune response in the
inﬂamed and/or macerated areas. Thus, a need exists for a
non-steroidal treatment for Candida overgrowth and inter-
trigo.

SUMMARY

[0006] Described herein are topical anti-fungal pastes and
methods that treat fungal infections of the skin, reduce the
severity and duration of symptoms of fungal infections of
the skin, and prevent recurrence of fungal infections. The
topical pastes described herein are composed of an admix-
ture of one or more antifungal agents, excipient inert pow-
der, and a phannaceutically acceptable topical carrier The
compositions and methods described herein minimize fun-
gal resistance and maximize the number of targeted fungal
strains. Additionally, the compounds and methods do not
suppress the body’s immune system either locally or sys-
temically, thus allowing for a faster restoration of normal
skin ﬂora. The compositions and methods described herein
are particularly suitable for use in infants and children as
well as in immunocompromised individuals, diabetics, and
the obese.

[0007] The advantages of the invention will be set forth in
part in the description which follows, and in part will be
obvious from the description, or may be learned by practice
of the aspects described below. The advanmges described
below will be realized and attained by means of the elements
and combinations particularly pointed out in the appended
claims. It is to be understood that both the foregoing general
description and the following detailed description are exem-
plary and explanatory only and are not restrictive.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[0008] Before the present compounds, compositions, and]
or methods are disclosed and described, it is to be under-
stood that the aspects described below are not limited to
speciﬁc compounds, synthetic methods, or uses as such may,
of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the tenni-
nology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular
aspects only and is not intended to be limiting.

[0009] In this speciﬁcation and in the claims that follow,
reference will be made to a number of terms that shall be
deﬁned to have the following meanings:

[0010] It must be noted that, as used in the speciﬁcation
and the appended claims, the singular forms “a,” “an” and
“the” include plural referents unless the context clearly
dictates otherwise. Thus, for example, reference to “an
imidazole antifungal” includes mixtures of two or more such
antifungals, and the like.

[0011] “Optional” or “optionally” means that the subse-
quently described event or circumstance can or cannot
occur, and that the description includes instances where the
event or circumstance occurs and instances where it does
not. For example, the phrase “optionally includes an excipi-
ent inert powder” means that the inert powder can or cannot
be included in the composition and that the description
includes compositions where the powder is included and
compositions where it is not included.

[0012] References in the speciﬁcation and concluding
claims to parts by weight, of a particular element or com-
ponent in a composition or article, denotes the weight
US 2019/0030055 A1

Excipient Inert Powder

[0028] The topical pastes described herein include one or
more excipient inert powders, The presence of the excipient
inert powder imparts a number of beneﬁcial properties with
the respect to the topical pastes described herein. The
excipient inert powder reduces the active ingredient con-
centrations of the antifungal agent. Reduced concentrations
of antifungal agent are desirable for the treatment of certain
patients such as, for example, children with diaper rash or
other sensitive individuals. In this aspect, the concentrations
of the antifungal agent are reduced to safe, but still efﬁca-
cious, levels for these subjects

[0029] Additionally, the excipient inert powder can impart
sweat and/or moisture absorption capabilities to the com-
positions described herein. Here, this absorption capability
is believed to be beneﬁcial because it reduces the suitability
of the affected areas for further fungal growth. In still
another aspect, the excipient ine11 powder acts as a skin
lubricant to reduce the skin friction, chaﬁng, and discomfort
that are common to intertrigo, candida] diaper dermatitis,
and other fungal infections of the skin.

[0030] Examples of excipient inert powders useful herein
include, but are not limited to talc, starch, zinc oxide, zinc
carbonate, magnesium oxide, magnesium carbonate, cala-
mine, calcium carbonate, kaolin, titanium dioxide, or any
combination thereof. As will be discussed below, the selec-
tion and amount of excipient inert powder can vary depend-
ing upon the application,

Pharmaceutically Acceptable Topical Carrier

[0031] The topical pastes described herein include a phar-
maceutically acceptable topical carrier. In one aspect, the
pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier includes a
cream, lotion, gel, or any other pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient that can be topically applied to a subject. The
nature of the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient can vary
depending upon the application.

[0032] In one aspect, the pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient is an oil-in-water cream. Not Wishing to be bound
by theory, the use of an oil-in-water cream in combination
with the excipient inert powder results in the formation of a
hygroscopic paste that is useful in controlling the environ-
ment where the fungal infection is located. By controlling
the environment at the site of infection, the antifungal agent
present in the paste is much more effective in treating and/or
preventing further re-occurring fungal infections in the
subject.

[0033] Oil-in-water creams known in the art can be used
in this aspect. The type and amount of oil or oily components
present in the cream can vary, Examples of such components
include, but are not limited to, mineral oil, petrolatum,
parabens, or glycols (erg, ethylene glycol). The amount of
oil or oily components can vary depending upon the envi-
ronmental conditions as well as the amount of moisture at
the site of application in the subject. In one aspect, the
amount of oily component(s) can be from 10% to 50% by
weight of the topical paste, In another aspect, the amount of
oily component(s) is 10%, 15%, 20%, 25%, 30%, 35%,
40%, 45%, or 50%, where any value can form a lower or
upper endpoint of a range. In another aspect, the amount of
water present in the oil-in-water cream is greater than 45%
by weight of the cream, 45% to 80% by weight of the cream,

Jan. 3], 2019

or 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%, 70%, 75%, or 80% by weight
of the cream, where any value can form a lower or upper
endpoint of a range.

[0034] In one aspect, a useful oil-in-water cream is Derm-
abase manufactured by Paddock Laboratories, Inc,, which is
composed of puriﬁed water, petrolatum, mineral oil, ceto-
stearyl alcohol, propylene glycol, isopropyl palmitate, meth-
ylparaben, and propylparabeni In another aspect, the oil-in-
water cream is Vanicream, which is composed of water,
white petrolatum, cetearyl alcohol, ceteareth—ZO, sorbitol
solution, propylene glycol, simethicone, glyceryl monoste-
arate, polyethylene glycol monostearate, sorbic acid, and
BHT. In another aspect, the oil-in-water cream is Velvachol
manufactured by Healthpoint, LTD, which is composed of
water, petrolatum, mineral oil, acetyl alcohol, stearyl alco-
hol, methylparaben, butylparaben, and propylparaben. In
another aspect, a useful oil-in-water emulsion cream base is
Aquaphilic® manufactured by Medco Lab Inc., which is
composed of water, stearyl alcohol, white petrolatum, pro-
pylene glycol, sorbitol, isopropyl palmitate, methylparaben,
and propylparaben.

[0035] In another aspect, the pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient is an oil-free cream base. In this embodiment, the
oil-free cream does not contain any oil components such as
mineral oil, petrolatum, parabens, or glycols (e.g., ethylene
glycol). In one aspect, the oil-free cream base is VersaBase®
manufactured by PCCA, which is composed of water, eth-
ylhexyl stearate, emulsifying wax, tocopherly acetatediso-
dium EDTA, sorbitol, cyclopentanesiloxane, methylchlor—
oisothiazolinone and methylisothiazolinonei In another
aspect, the pharmaceutically acceptable excipient is a lotion.
In another aspect, the lotion is VersaBase® topical lotion
base. In another aspect, the pharmaceutically excipient is a
gel. In another aspect, the gel is VersaBase® topical gel
base,

[0036] In other aspects, the pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient is not a water-in-oil base. As discussed above, the
topical pastes described herein are hygroscopic pastes that
are useful in controlling the environment where the fungal
infection is located. The pastes described herein wick or
remove moisture from the application site of the subject,
thereby controlling the humidity at the site of infection By
controlling the environment at the site of infection, the
antifungal agent present in the paste is much more effective
in treating and/or preventing further re-occurring fungal
infections in the subject. Additionally, the water-in-oil base
can prevent air from contacting the infection site, which can
promote the growth of bacteria under anaerobic conditions.
Thus, in certain aspects, the pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient is not a water-in-oil base, as these bases can trap
water and/or prevent the release of water at the infection site
as well as prevent air circulation at the infection site, which
ultimately produces an environment of sustained or
increased fungal growth and infection. Additionally, water-
in-oil bases are greasy and are more difﬁcult to remove when
compared to other bases (e.g., oil-in-water bases).

Preparation of Topical Pastes

[0037] The topical pastes described herein are formulated
with a sufﬁcient amount of excipient inert powder and to
produce a paste The pastes described herein are semisolid
materials composed of granular particles dispersed through-
out the pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier. The
primary source of the granular particles is derived from the
US 2019/0030055 A1

relationship between the element or component and any
other elements or components in the composition or article
for which a part by weight is expressed. Thus, in a com-
pound containing 2 parts by weight of component X and 5
parts by weight component Y, X and Y are present at a
weight ratio of 2:5, and are present in such ratio regardless
of whether additional components are contained in the
compound.

[0013] A weight percent of a component, unless speciﬁ-
cally stated to the contrary, is based on the total weight of the
formulation or composition in which the component is
included.

[0014] By “subject” is meant an individual. The subject
can be a mammal such as a primate or a human. The term
“subject” can include domesticated animals including, but
not limited to, cats, dogs, etc, livestock (e.g., cattle, horses,
pigs, sheep, goats, etc.), and laboratory animals (e.g., mouse,
rabbit, rat, guinea pig, etc.)

[0015] By “contacting” is meant an instance of exposure
by close physical contact of at least one substance to another
substance. For example, contacting can include contacting a
body surface, such as the skin of a subject, with a topical
composition described herein.

[0016] “Treatment” or “treating” means to administer a
composition to a subject or a system with an undesired
condition (e.g., fungal infection) to reduce the symptoms of
the undesired condition when compared to the same subject
that is not administered the composition. The compositions
described herein can reduce or arrest (i.e., stop) fungal
growth in a subject. The topical compositions described
herein can be applied directly to the infected area on the
subject and/or near the then infected area.

[0017] In other aspects, the compositions described herein
can prevent fungal growth in a subject. Here, the topical
compositions described herein can be applied to an area of
the subject that is prone to fungal infection.

[0018] By “effective amount” is meant a therapeutic
amount needed to achieve the desired result or results.
[0019] “Topical” refers to a composition that is applied to
the surface of a subject’s body. Topical compositions may be
applied, for example, to the skin, mucous membranes, hair,
nails, or any other exposed surface of the body.

[0020] A “fungal infection” is the invasion of the body by
pathogenic fungi. This invasion can produce tissue injury
and/or discomfort for the infected individual. Fungal infec-
tions can be opportunistic (e.g., resulting from overgrowth
of skin microbiota during conditions of immune suppres-
sion) or can be acquired from the environment (e.g., noso-
comial infections) An “antifungal” compound or composi-
tion is administered to subjects having fungal infections to
kill as well as reduce or prevent the growth of fungi.
[0021] “Burow’s solution” is an aqueous solution of alu-
minum acetate used in pharmacological applications, which
may range in concentration from 5% to 13%, depending on
the desired use. Burow’s solution is commonly employed
for control of symptoms associated with inﬂammatory skin
conditions and also is known to have antibacterial proper-
ties It is traditionally applied in a cold compress but can
optionally be used as a cleanser or astringent

[0022] An “excipient” is a pharmacologically inactive
substance included in a pharmaceutical composition. Excipi-
ents are used for a variety of purposes including binders and
ﬁllers, coatings, colors and ﬂavors, preservatives, sweeten-
ers, and the like, and are frequently employed to aid in the

Jan. 3], 2019

distribution and/or dispensing of pharmaceutical prepara-
tions. An “inert” excipient is an excipient that will not react,
biologically or chemically, with the other components of the
composition of which it is a part.

[0023] “’owder” is composed of ﬁne particles. Dry sub-
stances may be reduced to powders by techniques such as,
for example, grinding, pounding, or triturating.

I. Topical astes and Preparation Thereof

[0024] Described herein are topical pastes that reduce,
arrest, or revent fungal growth in a subject. The topical
pastes described herein are composed of an admixture of one
or more antifungal agents, excipient inert powder, and a
phannaceutically acceptable topical carrier Each compo-
nent used to prepare the topical formulations described
herein is iscussed in detail below.

Antifunga Agents

[0025] The topical pastes described herein include one or
more anti ungal agents. In one aspect, the antifungal agent
is an anti ungal imidazole. An “antifungal imidazole” is a
compounc that possesses antifungal properties and contains
at least one imidazole ring substituent. The imidazole ring
can optionally be further substituted. lmidazole antifungals
can include, but are not limited to, clotrimazole, miconazole,
ketoconazole, econazole, oxiconazole, luliconazole and
combinations thereof. Not wishing to be bound by theory,
imidazole antifungals mechanistically have been shown or
proposed to inhibit biosynthesis of the fungal sterol ergos-
terol, to interact with membrane phospholipids, to inhibit
endogenous respiration, and to inhibit transformation of
yeasts to mycelial forms

[0026] In another aspect, the antifungal agent is clotrima-
zole, ketoconazole, miconazole, oxiconazole, econazole,
luliconazole, terbinaﬁne, nystatin, ﬂuconazole, voricon-
azole, itraconazole, caspofungin, micafungin, naftiﬁne,
butenaﬁne, amorolﬁne, ravuconazole, posaconamle, ﬂucy-
tosine, sertaconazole, eﬁnaconazole, enilaconazole, saper-
conazole, sulconazole, terconazole, tioconazole, nikkomy-
cin Z, anidulafungin (LY303366), pimaricin, griseofulvin,
ciclopirox, haloprogin, tolnaﬁate, undecylenate, or any com-
bination thereof

[0027] The topical pastes described herein can include a
single antifungal agent or two or more antifungal agents
described herein. In one aspect, the antifungal agent includes
a ﬁrst agent and second agent, wherein the ﬁrst agent is
clotrimamle, ketoconazole, miconazole, oxiconazole, econ-
azole, luliconazole, terbinaﬁne, ﬂuconazole, voriconazole,
itraconazole, caspofungin, micafungin, naftiﬁne, butenaﬁne,
amorolﬁne, ravuconazole, posaconazole, ﬂucytosine, sert-
aconazole, eﬁnaconazole, enilaconazole, saperconazole, sul-
conazole, terconazole, tioconazole, nikkomycin Z, anidula-
fungin (LY 303366), pimaricin, griseofulvin, ciclopirox,
lialoprogin, tolnaﬁate, undecylenate, and the second agent is
nystatin. Not wishing to be bound by theory, antifungal
properties of polyenes such as nystatin are linked to binding
ergosterol. Thus, the beneficial effects of combining a poly-
ene with one or more antifungal agents described herein into
a single treatment composition have never before been
realized. For example, imidazole antifungals and polyenes
are not typically combined since it is thought that the
presence of one (imidazole) reduces the number of binding
sites available for the other (polyene).

include one or more additional components that can pro-
vided additional beneﬁts in addition to the enhanced anti-
fungal properties imparted by the paste. For example, the
pastes described herein can include an antipruitic agent to
stop or prevent itching, an analgesic, an antiseptic agent, or
any combination thereof. In one aspect, any of the topical
pastes described herein can include menthol in the amount
of 1% to 3% by weight of the paste, phenol in the amount
of 1% to 218% by weight of the paste, camphor in the amount
of 1% to 5% by weight of the paste, or any combination

11. Methods of Use

[0123] The topical pastes described herein can be used in
a variety of applications related to the treatment of fungal
infections, A method for treating a fungal infection includes
contacting an area showing symptoms of a fungal infection
with the compositions deﬁned above. The pastes described

Jan. 31, 2019

herein are superior alternatives to conventional treatments
consisting of anti fungal creams, ointments, or solutions,
and/or antifungal/steroid combination creams or ointments.
Additionally, in certain aspects, the combination of two
antifungal agents as in the pastes described herein will be
able to eiTectively eliminate or reduce the growth of strains
resistant to one, but not both, active ingredients. Thus, the
pastes described herein possess signiﬁcant advantages over
conventional treatments when dealing with complicated
cases and/or simultaneous infections by multiple strains of
fungi

[0124] In one aspect, the fungi causing the infection are
yeasts such as, for example, Candida albicans or other
Candida spp. including C, glabrata, C. rugosa, C. parape
silosis, C. tropicalis, or C. dubliniensis In another aspect, the
fungi are dermatophytes such as, for example, Trichophyton
spp. and Microsporum spp. In a further aspect, the dermato-
phytes are Epidermaphyton ﬂoccosum, I rubrum, T inter-
digitale, T tonrumns, T violaceum, I concentricum, T
schoenleinii, I soua'anense, T mentagrophyles, I equinum,
T erirmcei, T verrucnrum, M audnuinii, M. ferrugineum,
M canir, M gypreum, M nanum, and/or M cankei.
[0125] In another aspect, the fungal infection causes a
fungal disease such as, for example, tinea cruris, tinea
corporis, tinea versicolor, candidiasis, tinea pedis, intertrigo,
seborrhoeic dermatitis, diaper rash, tinea capitis, tinea bar-
bae, thrush, diaper dermatitis (children and adults) or a
combination thereof. In a still further aspect, the fungal
disease causes symptoms such as, for example, itching, a
burning sensation, ﬂaking skin, peeling skin, rash, redness,
cracking skin, scaly skin, blisters, macerated skin, odor, or
a combination thereof.

[0126] In one aspect, the pastes described herein are useful
in treating or preventing intertrigo, Intertrigo is an inﬂam-
mation or rash caused by overgrowth of yeast species such
as, for example, Candida albicans. Intertrigo aﬂlicts areas of
the body that have skin touching skin such as the groin,
armpits, between the buttocks, under heavy breasts, in the
inner thighs, beneath penile foreskin, the perianal area,
genital area, between the toes, in the crease of the neck, and
abdominal fat folds provide the perfect environment for
Candida albicans imbalance and symptom presentation. The
body heat and moisture present in these intertriginous areas
provide a prime milieu for the proliferation of yeasts such as
Candida, leading to irritation, redness, intense itching, burn-
ing, pain and odor. Maceration and/or characteristic satellite
reddened plaques/lesions often present under the breast, in
the abdominal folds, and in the inguinal area. Intertrigo
frequently presents as candida] diaper rash as well.

[0127] Factors that frequently cause or contribute to inter-
trigo include immune deﬁciencies, obesity, diabetes, incon-
tinence, heat, humid weather, tight or abrasive clothing or
underclothing, lack of air circulation, friction between skin
folds, excessive sweating and moisture, poor hygiene, mal-
nutrition, inadequate bra support, inﬂammatory skin condi-
tions like psoriasis in skin folds, and the use of topical
steroids. Infants and toddlers, with their chubbiness, shorter
necks, and bended posture, are also at increased risk for
intertrigo.

[0128] Intertrigo is also particularly common among
immunocompromised patients. “Immunocompromised
patients” are individuals with weakened immune systems
resulting from, for example, HIV or AIDS, chemotherapy
and/or radiation such as for cancer treatment, long-tenn
US 2019/0030055 A1

corticosteroid or glucocorticoid therapy, anti-rejection drugs
taken by transplant recipients, cancers of the bone marrow
or the blood, splenectomy, or congenital deﬁciencies.
[0129] In another aspect, the pastes described herein are
useful in treating or preventing candidal diaper rash. Can-
didal diaper dermatitis (i.e., diaper rash) is a common yeast
overgrowth infection caused by Candida albicans that fre-
quently presents in the perianal area and between the but-
tocks of infants and toddlers. Visits to outpatient pediatric
ofﬁces for diaper dermatitis total 1 million per year. Infant
skin is thinner than that of adults, produces fewer secretions,
and is more susceptible to irritation and infection. Measures
to decrease maceration of the skin in these areas include
frequent diaper changes, avoiding impervious diaper covers,
and long periods without diapers, Still, topical antifungal
therapy is necessary for resolution of candida] diaper rash.
[0130] The pastes described herein can be used to treat
fungal infections and diseases and also to reduce the severity
of or eliminate symptoms caused by fungal infections and
diseases. In one aspect, a method for treating a fungal
disease in a subject is provided. In this aspect, a subject is
contacted with an effective amount of one or more of the
antifungal compositions described herein. In a further
aspect, the subject is a mammal In a still further aspect, the
mammal is a human or other primate, a cat, a dog, cattle, a
horse, a pig, a sheep, a goat, a mouse, a rabbit, a rat, a guinea
pig, or any other domesticated, captive, or livestock mam-
mal,

[0131] In a further aspect, the method involves contacting
the affected area(s) of a subject with the compositions
described herein. This contact may occur one, two, three, or
four times daily. In one aspect, the topical compositions
described herein can be applied to an area that is susceptible
to fungal infection. In this aspect, the topical compositions
described herein can prevent infection by the fungus
[0132] In another aspect, the method involves initiating
treatment at the onset of symptoms associated with fungal
infection or disease. In another aspect, the method involves
initiating treatment at any time after the onset of symptoms
associated with fungal infection or disease. In one aspect,
treatment is stopped upon resolution of the symptoms asso-
ciated with fungal infection or disease. In another aspect,
treatment is continued after the resolution of the symptoms.
In this aspect, continued treatment is believed to help
prevent the recurrence of symptoms and/or the resurgence of
resistant fungal strains. In still another aspect. treatment may
be continued for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, or up to 7 days after the
resolution of symptoms. In yet another aspect, the compo-
sitions may be applied sparingly or liberally to the affected
area. In some aspects, the affected area is washed with water
or a mild soap prior to application of the compositions
described herein.

[0133] In a still further aspect, the methods and compo-
sitions described herein speciﬁcally exclude topical and/or
systemic treatment with glucocorticoids. Thus, the compo-
sitions and mixtures disclosed herein can aid in the resto-
ration of natural ﬂora balance and skin fold integrity without
the use of glucocorticoids

[0134] In the alternative, a glucocorticoid compound and
the compositions described herein can be simultaneously
administered In another aspect, the compositions described
herein can include other active antifungal ingredients or
other ingredients that provide immediate relief from symp-
toms associated with fungal infection and disease.

[0135] In one aspect, the area to be treated is ﬁrst pre-
treated prior to application of the topical compositions
described herein. For example, the area of the subject can be
ﬁrst contacted with Burow’s solution, either topically or
included as part of a cold compress, prior to application of
the compositions described herein In this aspect, Burow’s
solution cleanses the affected area and/or allows the subject
immediate relief from symptoms such as itching, burning,
and the like. Prior to application of the topical application,
the area to be treated should be dried as thoroughly as
possible, as moisture can promote fungal growth on the skin,
[0136] In other aspects, the topical pastes described herein
can be incorporated into articles that can be used to treat or
prevent fungal infections. For example, the pastes can be
incorporated in or applied to diapers and surgical pads where
fungal infections are prevalent. Here, the articles can help
reduce or control moisture at the site of infection or potential
infection and ultimately treat or prevent fungal infection.

Trial 1

[0138] An obese female with severe chemotherapy-related
inguinal intertrigo was treated and observed. Initially, one-
dimensional therapy with clotrimazole cream 1% applied 3
times a day neutraliIed progression within 4 days, but she
remained uncomfortably symptomatic and tissues remained
red and still macerated in part due to continued sweating in
the infected area.

[0139] Nystatin-Triamcinolone cream was instituted on
day 5 due to unrelenting itching, burning, and inﬂammation
in the groin. Symptomatic relief followed within 2 days and
applications of the antifungal-steroid cream combination
continued for 10 days with substantial symptomatic and
apparent therapeutic resolution. However, recurrence and
escalation resumed a week later following this apparent
resolution,

[0140] Aware of the possible risks associated with pro-
longed steroid use, the following antifungal agents were
singularly employed: ketoconazole cream 2% was applied 2
to 3 times a day with signiﬁcant yet marginal lasting efﬁcacy,
and discontinuation after 8 days was followed with micon-
azole cream 2% applied 2 to 3 times a day for more than 7
days. Antimicrobial therapy was discontinued and Baby

the second agent is nystatin.

[0076] In the case when two or more antifungal agents are
to be used, the agents an independently be used as a bulk
powder and/or formulated in a can'ier (e.g., cream). For
example, clotrimazole cream (1%) can be formulated with
nystatin powder and additional excipient inert powder to
produce the topical paste:

[0077] In one aspect, when nystatin is used as one of the
antifungal agents, the nystatin (powder or cream) has an
activity of 10,000 units/gram to 500,000 units/gram; 50,000
units/gram to 250,000 units/gram; 75,000 units/gram to
150,000 units/gram, or 100,000 units/gram, In another
aspect, the nystatin powder is from 1% to 3% by weight of
the powder and has an activity from 75,000 units/gram to
150,000 units/gram.

[0078] In one aspect, when two antifungal agents are
employed, the ﬁrst agent is from 0.1 to 3% by weight of the
paste and nystatin is from 0.1% to 3% by weight of the paste:

excipient inert powder. However, when the antifungal agent
used to prepare the topical paste is also a granular material,
the antifungal agent can also contribute to the formation of
the topical paste. The amount of the granular particles can
also vary depending upon the moisture levels in the envi-
ronment. For example, in hot, humid conditions, the higher
amounts of granular particles can be included in the com-
position,

[0038] In one aspect, the topical paste is produced by
admixing one or more antifungal agents and excipient inert
powder in the pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier so
that the antifungal agent and excipient inert powder are
evenly or homogeneously dispersed throughout the pharma-
ceutically acceptable topical carrier, Techniques known in
the art for homogeneously dispersing the ingredients of the
topical paste can be used herein

[0039] In one aspect, the topical pastes described herein
are composed of 10% to 80% by weight granular particles
(excipient inert powder and optionally antifungal agent). In
another aspect, the topical paste is composed of 10%, 15%,
20%, 25%, 30%, 35%, 40%, 45%, 50%, 55%, 60%, 65%,
70%, 75%, or 80% by weight granular particles, where any
value can form a lower and upper end-point of a range. In
another aspect, the topical paste is composed of 10% to 80%,
10% to 70%, 10% to 60%, 10% to 50%, 10% to 40%, 10%
to 30%, 20% to 30%, 20% to 80%, 30% to 80%, 40% to
80%. 50% to 80%, 60% to 80%, or 70% to 80% by weight
granular particles,

[0040] In one aspect, the antifungal agent used to produce
the paste can be admixed with the excipient inert powder and
the pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier as a pure
powder. Thus, in one aspect, pure antifungal compound
(>99%) in powder form can be admixed with the excipient
inert powder and the pharmaceutically accepmble topical
carrier to produce the topical paste. The following is a
non-limiting example of a 2% by weight topical paste of
ketoconazole (100 g in total):

[004]] 2 g ketoconazole (99.987% purity)

[0042] 16 g talc

[0043] 10 g starch

[0044] 7 g zinc oxide

[0045] 5 g magnesium oxide

[0046] 60 g oil-in-water cream

[0047] In another aspect, the antifungal agent has been

formulated into a powder prior to admixing with the excipi-
ent inert powder and the pharmaceutically acceptable topical
carrier. An example of this is nystatin. Pure nystatin has not
less than 4,400 units/mg (or 4,400,000 units/gm). The phar-
maceutical concentration of nystatin is 100,000 units/gm.
Therefore, the bulk of nystatin powder is an inert powder.
Thus, when the antifungal has been formulated into a
powder, the antifungal agent and any inert powder present in
the antifungal agent can also contribute the degree of
pastiness of the topical paste.
[0048] In another aspect, topical paste produced by the
process comprising admixing
[0049] a. ﬁrst composition comprising an antifungal agent
in a pharmaceutically acceptable topical carrier, and
[0050] b. an excipient inert powder,
wherein the excipient inert powder is in a suﬂicient amount
to form a paste comprising granular particles evenly distrib-
uted in the pharmaceutically acceptable topical cream.
[0051] In this aspect, the antifungal agent has been for-
mulated in the pharmaceutically acceptable topical canier

Jan. 31, 2019

prior to the addition of the excipient inert powder. For

example, 1% clotrimazole cream (OTC) can admixed with

one or more excipient inert powders to produce a topical
paste with varying degrees of pastiness, In one aspect, the

ﬁrst composition is 0.5% to 1.3% clotrimazole cream, 0.5%

to 2% ketoconazole cream, 05% to 2% miconazole cream,

05% to 1% oxiconazole cream, 05% to 1% luliconazole

cream, or 05% to 2% terbinaﬁne cream, In another aspect,

the ﬁrst composition is 1% clotrimazole cream, 1% clotri-
mazole lotion, 1% clotrimazole topical solution, 2% keto-
conazole cream, 2% miconazole nitrate cream, 1% oxicon-

azole nitrate cream, 1% oxiconazole nitrate lotion, 1%

econazole nitrate cream, 1% luliconazole cream, 1% terbi-

naﬁne cream, and combinations thereof.

[0052] It will be appreciated that the actual preferred

amounts of antifungal agent will vary according to the

speciﬁc compound being utilized, the particular composi-
tions formulated, the mode of application, and the particular
sites and subject being treated, Dosages for a given host can
be determined using conventional considerations, e.g, by
customary comparison of the diﬂerential activities of the
subject compounds and of a known agent, e.g., by means of
an appropriate conventional pharmacological protocol. Phy-
sicians and formulators, skilled in the art of determining
doses of pharmaceutical compounds, will have no problems
determining dose according to standard recommendations

(Physicians Desk Reference, Bamhart Publishing-1999), In

one aspect, the antifungal agent is from 0.25 to 5% by

weight of the paste. In another aspect, the antifungal agent
is from 0.25 to 5%, 025 to 4%, 025 to 3%, or 0.5 to 3% by
weight of the paste.

[0053] In one aspect, the topical paste is composed of

[0054] (l) a single antifungal agent composed of clotri-
mazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, oxiconazole, econ-
azole, nystatin, luliconazole, terbinaﬁne, ﬂuconazole,
voriconazole, itraconazole, caspofungin, micafungin, naf-
tiﬁne, butenaﬁne, amorolﬁne, ravuconazole, posacon-
azole, ﬂucytosine, sertaconazole, eﬁnaconazole, enilacon-
azole, saperconazole, sulconazole, terconazole,
tioconazole, nikkomycin Z, anidulafungin (LY303366),
pimaricin, griseofulvin, ciclopirox, haloprog'in, tolnaftate,
or undecylenate;

[0055] (2) an excipient inert powder comprising talc,
starch, zinc oxide, zinc carbonate, magnesium oxide,
magnesium carbonate, calamine, calcium carbonate,
kaolin, titanium dioxide, or any combination thereof; and

[0056] (3) an oil-in-water cream,

wherein the paste comprises from 10% to 80% by weight

granular particles, where the source of the granular particles

is the excipient inert powder alone or in combination with
the antifungal agent.

[0057] In one aspect, the topical pastes are independently
the following (% by weight including carrier and inert
powder):

[0058] Clotrimazole 1%

[0059] Ketoconazole 2%

[0060] Miconazole 2%

Powder (talc) was applied twice a day, which appeared to
enable integumentary improvement in a dry, chemical-free
environment; redness, inﬂammation, and maceration abated
signiﬁcantly.

[0141] Nystatin powder was then “tested” near onset of
the next recurrence; bathing or cleansing and drying of
affected and surrounding tissues preceded application two or
three times a day. Substantial improvement ensued initially
and appeared to provide a more sustainable healing “envi-
ronrnen ”, though intertrigo presented repeatedly from time
to time.

[0142] Paste dosage formulations of the present invention
were subsequently evaluated Although several creamy paste
dosage formulations described herein were eﬁicacious, the
female subject responded best to a creamy pasty clotrima-
zole cream/nystatin powder formulation (a mixture of 20
grams of nystatin powder spatulated into 30 grams of
clotrimazole cream). Higher degrees of pastiness were
employed in increasingly elevated situation with corre-
spondingly favorable results. Various clinical presentations
observed over time suggested ratios ranging from 4:1 to 1:1
cream to powder. Resolution lasting months was achieved in
the inguinal and upper thigh regions as well as occasional
ﬂare-ups under heavy breasts. Repeated yet far less frequent
challenges over several years yielded consistent, superior
and reliable results. The cycle of recalcitrance and frequent
resurgence has remained resolved in this subject for the past
3 years.

Trial 2

[0143] A second obese, elderly female subject experienced
similar favorable and lasting results using a creamy paste
dosage formulations (20 grams of nystatin powder spatu-
lated into 30 grams of clotrimazole cream) described herein
following decades of frequent intertrigo treatment with
conventional single-entity antifungal creams or powders and
antiﬁlngal/steroid combinations. This subject also continues
to rely on swift, predictable, and lasting resolution from
occasional ﬂare-ups.

Trial 3

[0144] A third male subject who experienced occasional
intertrigo over several years was evaluated. Nystatin—triam-
cinolone cream was initially prescribed and applied twice
daily on the infected areas. Although signiﬁcant relief from
intense itching and burning was achieved within 3 days
followed by a 90% reduction in inﬂammatory presentation
within 2 weeks, reoccurrence ensued a week later with heat
and exercise-induced sweating as aggravating factors. Once
again, nystatin-triamcinolone cream reduced symptoms
within a few days, and nystatin cream was applied twice a
day for 3 more weeks but total resolution would not occur
[0145] Other antimicrobial creams including miconazole
nitrate, clotrimazole, and ketoconazole were intermittently
applied in successive ﬂare-up situations over the next 4
months; however, lasting resolution appeared unachievable
as this cycle of recalcitrant yeast overgrowth refused to
respond and abate with conventional pharmaceuticals.

[0146] Next, several topical herb formulas containing
various blends of calendula, tea tree oil, chamomile, echi-
nacea, ginger, coconut oil, rosemary, organic jatoba, olive
oil, thyme, vitamin E, lavender, and other pure essential oils
were evaluated. Mixtures of these components were also

evaluated in order to maximize elﬁcacy of the formulations.
On several occasions, oral coconut oil capsules and iodine
tablets were employed without lasting impact or predictable
eﬂicacy. Topical lavender and tea tree oil formulations held
the most utility but proved far too caustic when applied to
macerated intertriginous regions. Most others simply lacked
therapeutic beneﬁt. Ultimately, none proved worthy of men-
tion or recommendation from a pharmacist recognized as
one who only endorses superior products in any category.
[0147] Conventional pharmaceutical antifungals were
revisited, this time in combination. Cream/cream, ointrnent/
ointment, solution/cream, lotion/cream mixtures of the vari-
ous azoles/nystatin were employed seeking enhanced eﬁi-
cacy and potential expanded coverage; disappointing lack of
synergism was the result.

[0148] Finally, comprehensive intertrigo management
beginning with application of a mixture of 20 grams of
nystatin powder spatulated into 30 grams of clotrimazole
cream interrupted the prolonged cycle of partial remission
followed by recurrence, escalation, and recalcitrance. Vary-
ing degrees of pastiness were subsequently employed
depending on degree of maceration, heat, and moisture
presence. Affected and surrounding areas were cleansed and
dried thoroughly prior to liberal application up to 4 times a
day. Twice daily application proved suﬂicient after 4 days,
and once daily maintenance with a creamier mixture after 10
days carried therapy to term on day 15. Ancillary measures
employed at various stages of treatment included occasional
and soothing burows solution astringent compresses and
frequent underwear changes.

[0149] In the 5 years since, occasional ﬂare-ups of ingui-
nal and perineal intertrigo have occurred from time to time
allowing opportunities for further validation of the utility of
the formulation described above; congruent with previous
ﬁndings, higher degrees of pastiness were employed in
increasingly elevated moisture situations with correspond-
ingly favorable results. Incredibly, microbial balance and
skin fold healing is oﬁen restored within 3 days when
treatment is initiated in a timely fashion. Though most
complicated clinical presentations require 10 to 14 days,
total microbial eradication and overkill is unnecessary when
follow up measures to control heat and moisture are
employed following symptom resolution and integumentary
normalcy restoration.

[0150] For the sake of ongoing study, challenge, and
comparison, the subject was administered a 1:1 mixture of
clotrimarole cream and nystatin cream to treat inguinal
intertrigo that had spread to the scrotum. However, this
formulation provided limited results when compared to the
administration of the 3:2 clotrimazole cream/nystatin pow-
der paste, which was applied within 4 days with accelerated
results consistent with above.

[0151] Disappointing and discouraging fungicidal activity
observations became predictably remarkable remedy with
paste formulation and application of the same active phar-
maceutical ingredient(s) (API(s)) employed previously.
Unlike the pastes that controlled site moisture as well as
yeast overgrowth, current azole creams, solutions , lotions,
and nystatin cream or ointment products, by themselves or
in combination were unremarkable and lacked potential
efﬁcacy in simple and complicated yeast overgrowth pre-
sentations. The pastes described herein remained the most
encouraging object of present and future product study and
development from a bulk active or a combination of API’s

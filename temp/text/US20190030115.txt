[0178] Peptide Part of the Analogue

[0179] The peptide analogue according to the present
invention comprises a peptide and one or more branched
amino acid probes.

[0180] In one embodiment the peptide of the peptide
analogue is any peptide, polypeptide or protein, which
peptide in one embodiment is native or naturally occurring,
which peptide in one embodiment is a biologically active
variant of a naturally occurring peptide,

[0181] In one embodiment said peptide is a fragment of a
larger polypeptide or protein.

[0182] In one embodiment said peptide is an N-terminal
fragment comprising from 1-50 of the most N-terminal
amino acids of said protein, such as 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6,
6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10, 10-12,12-14,14-16, 16-18,18—20,20—25,
25-30, 30-35, 35-40, 40-45, 45-50 of the most N—terminal
amino acids of said protein,

[0183] In one embodiment said peptide is a C-terminal
fragment comprising from 1-50 of the most C-terminal
amino acids of said protein, such as 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6,
6-7, 7-8, 8-9, 9-10,10—12,12-14,14-16, 16-18,18—20,20—25,

Jan. 31, 2019

said protein, such as 1-2, 2-3, 3-4, 4-5, 5-6, 6—7, 7-8, 8-9,
9-10, 10-12, 12-14,14—16, 16-18, 18-20, 20-25, 25-30,
30-35, 35-40, 40-45, 45-50 consecutive amino acid residues
of said protein.

[0185] In some embodiments, the peptide analogues pro-
vided herein have one or more improved properties com-
pared to the native peptide,

[0186] A peptide is a single linear polymer chain derived
from the condensation of amino acids Peptides may be
distinguished from proteins on the basis of size, and as an
arbitrary benchmark can be understood to contain approxi-
mately 75 (such as 50) or fewer amino acid residues.
[0187] In one embodiment the peptide part of the peptide
analogue of the present invention is a peptide having (com-
prising or consisting of) 2 to 100 amino acid residues, such
as from 2 to 3, for example 3 to 4, such as 4 to 5, for example
5 to 6, such as 6 to 7, for example 7 to 8, such as 8 to 9, for
example 9 to 10, such as 101012, for example 12 to 14, such
as 14 to 16, for example 16 to 18, such as 18 to 20, for
example 20 to 25, such as 25 to 30, for example 30 to 40,
such as 40 to 50, for example 50 to 75, such as 75 to 100
amino acid residues.

[0188] In one embodiment the peptide of the present
invention is a peptide having less than 50 amino acid
residues, such as less than 40, for example less than 30,
amino acid residues.

[0189] The sequence of amino acid residues in a native
peptide is deﬁned by the sequence of a gene, which is
encoded in the genetic code. In general, the genetic code
speciﬁes 20 standard amino acids naturally incorporated into
polypeptides (proteinogenic): Ala, Arg, Asn, Asp, Cys, Gln,
GIu, GIy, His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Pro, Ser, Tyr, Thr,
Trp, Val, and 2 which are incorporated into proteins by
unique synthetic mechanisms: Sec (selenocysteine, or U)
and Pyl (pyrrolysine, 0), These are all L—stereoisomers,
[0190] Aside from the 22 standard or natural amino acids,
there are many other non-naturally occurring amino acids
(non-proteinogenic or non-standard), They are either not
found in proteins, or are not produced directly and in
isolation by suindard cellular machinery

[0191] Non-standard amino acids are usually formed
through modiﬁcations to standard amino acids, such as
post-translational modiﬁcations, Examples of unnatural
amino acid residues are Nle (Norleucine), Orn (ornithine,
deguanylated Arginine), Nal (beta-2-naphthyl-alanine),
D-Nal (beta-2-naphthyl-D-alanine), D-Arg, D-Trp, D-Phe
and D-Val.

[0192] Any amino acids according to the present invention
may be in the L- or D-conﬁg‘uration, If nothing is speciﬁed,
reference to the L-isomeric form is preferably meant.
[0193] The term peptide also embraces post-translational
modiﬁcations introduced by chemical or enzyme-catalyzed
reactions, as are known in the art. Such post-translational
modiﬁcations can be introduced prior to partitioning, if
desired. Also, functional equivalents may comprise chemi-
cal modiﬁcations such as ubiquitination, labeling (e.g,, with
radionuclides, various enzymes, etc), pegylation (derivati-
zation with polyethylene glycol), or by insertion (or substi-
tution by chemical synthesis) of amino acids such as omi-
thine, which do not normally occur in human proteins,
[0194] Peptides with N-terminal alkylations and C-termi-
nal estcriﬁcations are also encompassed within the present
invention. Functional equivalents also comprise glycosy-
lated and covalent or aggregative conjugates formed with

[0360] In one embodiment of the present invention, the
peptides of the present invention are on crystalline forms, for
example co-crystallized forms or hydrates of crystalline
forms.

[0361] The term “prodrug” refers to peptides that are
rapidly transformed in vivo to yield the parent compound of
the above formulae, for example, by hydrolysis in blood or
by metabolism in cells, such as for example the cells of the
basal ganglia. A thorough discussion is provided in T.
Higuchi and V Stella, “Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Sys-
tems,” Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in
Bioreversible Carrier: in Drug Design, ed. Edward B.
Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association and Pergamon
Press, 1987, both of which are hereby incorporated by
reference. Examples of prodrugs include pharmaceutically
acceptable, non-toxic esters of the compounds of the present
invention. Esters of the compounds of the present invention
may be prepared according to conventional methods
“March’s Advanced Organic Chemistry, 5‘” Edition”, M. B.
Smith & J. March, John Wiley & Sons, 2001,

[0362] In one embodiment, for parenteral administration,
solutions of peptides according to the present invention in
sterile aqueous solution, in aqueous propylene glycol or in
sesame or peanut oil are employed. Aqueous solutions
should be suitably buifered where appropriate, and the liquid
diluent rendered isotonic with, e.g., sufficient saline or
glucose. Aqueous solutions are particularly suitable for
intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperito-
neal administration. The sterile aqueous media to be
employed are all readily available by standard techniques
known to those skilled in the art.

[0363] Suitable pharmaceutical carriers include inert solid
diluents or ﬁllers, sterile aqueous solutions and various
organic solvents, Examples of solid carriers are lactose, terra
alba, sucrose, cyclodextrin, talc, gelatine, agar, pectin, aca-
cia, magnesium stearate, stearic acid and lower alkyl ethers
of cellulose. Examples of liquid carriers are syrup, peanut
oil, olive oil, phospholipids, fatty acids, fatty acid amines,
polyoxyethylene and water, Moreover, the carrier or diluent
may include any sustained release material known in the art,
such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate, alone
or mixed with a wax. The pharmaceutical compositions
formed by combining the compounds according to the
present invention and the pharmaceutically acceptable car-
riers are then readily administered in a variety of dosage
forms suitable for the disclosed routes of administration. The
formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage
form by methods known in the art of pharmacy,

[0364] Formulations of the present invention suitable for
oral administration may be presented as discrete units, such
as capsules or tablets, which each contain a predetermined
amount of the active ingredient, and which may include a
suitable excipient.

Jan. 31, 2019

[0365] Furthermore, the orally available formulations may
e in the form of a powder or granules, a solution or
suspension in an aqueous or non-aqueous liquid, or an
oil-in-water or water-in-oil liquid emulsion,

[0366] Compositions intended for oral use may be pre-
ared according to any known method, and such composi-
tions may contain one or more agents selected from the
group consisting of sweetening agents, ﬂavouring agents,
colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide
ahannaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets
may contain the active ingredient(s) in admixture with
non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients which are
suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients
may, for example, be: inert diluents, such as calcium car-
aonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or
sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for
example corn starch or alginic acid; binding agents, for
example, starch, gelatine or acacia; and lubricating agents,
or example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The
tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known
techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the
gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action
over a longer period. For example, a time delay material
such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be
employed. They may also be coated by the techniques
described in US. Pat. Nos. 4,356,108; 4,166,452; and 4,265,
874, the contents of which are incorporated herein by

[0367] Formulations for oral use may also be presented as
hard gelatine capsules where the active ingredient is mixed
with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium carbonate,
calcium phosphate or kaolin, or a soft gelatine capsules
wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil
medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraﬁin, or olive oil.

 

[0368] Aqueous suspensions may contain the compound
for use according to the present invention in admixture with
excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspen-
sions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example
sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose, hydroxy-
propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrroli-
done, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting
agents may be a naturally-occurring phosphatide such as
lecithin, or condensation products of an alkylene oxide with
fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or con-
densation products of ethylene oxide with long chain ali-
phatic alcohols, for example, heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol,
or condensation products of ethylene oxide with partial
esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as poly-
oxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation products
of ethylene oxide with partial esters derived from fatty acids
and hexitol anhydrides, for example polyethylene sorbitan
monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one
or more colouring agents, one or more ﬂavouring agents,
and one or more sweetening agents, such as sucrose or
saccharin.

[0369] Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending
the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis
oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil
such as a liquid parafﬁn. The oily suspensions may contain
a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard parafﬁn or
cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such as those set forth
above, and ﬂavouring agents may be added to provide a
US 2019/0030115 A1

palatable oral preparationr These compositions may be pre-
served by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic
acid.

[0370] Dispersible powders and granules suitable for
preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of
water provide the active compound in admixture with a
dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or
more preservatives Suitable dispersing or wetting agents
and suspending agents are exempliﬁed by those already
mentioned above, Additional excipients, for example, sweet-
ening, ﬂavouring, and colouring agents may also be present
[0371] The pharmaceutical compositions comprising pep-
tides for use according to the present invention may also be
in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be
a vegetable oil, for example, olive oil or arachis oil, or a
mineral oil, for example a liquid paraﬂln, or a mixture
thereof. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-oc-
curring gums, for example gum acacia or gum tragacanth,
naturally-occurring phosphatides, for example soy bean,
lecithin, and esters or partial esters derived from fatty acids
and hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate,
and condensation products of said partial esters with ethyl-
ene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan
monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening
and ﬂavouring agents,

[0372] Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweet-
ening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sor-
bitol or sucrose, Such formulations may also contain a
demulcent, a preservative and ﬂavouring and colouring
agent, The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form
of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension,
This suspension may be formulated according to the known
methods using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and
suspending agents described above. The sterile injectable
preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or
suspension in a non-toxic parenterally-acceptable diluent or
solvent, for example as a solution in 1,3-butanediol, Among
the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed
are water, Ringer’s solution, and isotonic sodium chloride
solution. In addition, sterile, ﬁxed oils are conveniently
employed as solvent or suspending medium, For this pur-
pose, any bland ﬁxed oil may be employed using synthetic
mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic
acid ﬁnd use in the preparation of injectables,

[0373] The compositions may also be in the form of
suppositories for recml administration of the compounds of
the invention, These compositions can be prepared by mix-
ing the compound with a suitable non-irritating excipient
which is solid at ordinary temperatures but liquid at the
rectal temperature and will thus melt in the rectum to release
the drug. Such materials include, for example, cocoa butter
and polyethylene glycolsr

[0374] Peptides of the present invention may also be
administered in the form of liposome delivery systems, such
as small unilamellar vesicles, large unilamellar vesicles, and
multilamellar vesicles. Liposomes may be formed from a
variety of phospholipids, such as but not limited to choles-
terol, stearylamine or phosphatidylcholines.

[0375] In addition, some peptides of the present invention
may form solvates with water or common organic solvents,
Such solvates are also encompassed within the scope of the
invention,

wherein said treatment may be prophylactic, ameliorative or

[0386] The modiﬁed peptides according to this invention
may be used to treat the same diseases and conditions for
which the parent peptide has been indicated

Synthesis of BAP-Modiﬁed a-MSH Peptide
Analogues

[0337]

a-MSH analogue 1:
Ac- (Ac-Lys -Lys-) Lye -Ser-Tyr-Ser-Met-Glu-His-Phe-
Arg-Trp-Gly- Lys-Pro-Val-NHZ

erSH analogue 1:
AC?(AerLysrLySJLysrTyrrValrMetrGlyrHiSrPherArgr
(DrTrp) *AsprArnghErGlerI-IZ,

[0388] The peptides are manufactured using Fmoc
(9-ﬂuorenylmethyloxycarbonyl) chemistry. Peptides are
made using a polystyrene resin, functionalized with an
appropriate linker, and the peptides are then manufactured
using an Intavis Peptide Synthesizen A 4-fold excess of
amino acid is added relative to the resin and either HATU
(O-(7-azabenzotriazol-1-yl)—N,N,N‘,N'-tetramethyluronium
hexaﬂuorophosphate) or HCTU (2-(6-Chloro-1Iil-benzotri-
azole—l-yl)—1,1,3,3-tetramethylaminium hexaﬂuorophos-
phate) were used at a 3.95-fold excess to create the active
ester, Along with an 8-fold excess of DIPEA (N,N-Diiso-
propylethylarnine) as the base, these reagents catalyze the
addition of the next amino acid, Once the amino acid is
coupled (each cycle includes a double coupling cycle to
insure eﬁicient coupling) the resin is exposed to 20% acetic
anhydride to terminate (“cap-oﬂ”) any peptide chains that
have not added the next amino acid.

[0389] The amino acids are dissolved in NMP (N -Methyl-
2-pyrrolidone) or DMF (Dimethylformamide) For washing,
Piperidine is used to remove the Fmoc group at the end of
each coupling cycle which allows the next amino acid to be
added.

[0390] a-MSH analogue 1 was made with Lys(Mtt) on the
end; the peptide was acetylated, the Mtt was removed, added
Lys, added Lys and then acetylate again.

[0391] For y-MSH analogue 1 the addition of one or more
pseudoproline (oxazolidine) dipeptides during the synthesis
of serine- and/or threonine-containing peptides resulted in
improvements in peptide quality and an increase in the yield
of full length crude peptide. In this case the peptide was
made up to the MEHF, a pseudoproline dipeptide (Fmoc-
YS) was added, the next amino acid “Ser” was coupled 3
times to insure it went to completion, and the peptide
ﬁnished manually by adding the Lys(Mtt), acetylating, and
then ﬁnishing as above.

[0392] In each case the peptides were dried using MeOH
(3x), DCM (3x), cleaved using 92% TFA, 2% water, 2%
triisopropylsilane, 2% thioanisole and 2% ethanedithiol for
3-4 h at room temperature. Peptides were precipitated in
cold diethyl ether, centrifuged (2,000 RPM) and the pellets

Jan. 31, 2019

washed 2>< with cold etheri After drying the peptides were
solubilized in water containing 0.1% TFA (buffer A) and
subjected to RP-HPLC using C18 columns (butfer B:95%
acetonitrile/0.1% TFA),

[0393] The purity was determined by analytical HPLC and
theoretical mono isotopic molecular masses we conﬁrmed
by MS. The sequence integrity was veriﬁed by CID tandem
MS/MS sequencing.

Pharmacological Characterization of BAP-Modiﬁed
a-MSH Analogues

[0394] Method:

[0395] Murine B16-F1 cells expressing MCrl are used for
determination of binding afﬁnity to and agonist activity
against the MClr Human recombinant CHO cells express-
ing MC3r, MC4r or MC5r are used for determination of
afﬁnity to or agonist activity against the MC3r, MC4r and
MC5r, respectively, The binding afﬁnity is determined in
experiments conducted as described in the procedures for
radioligand binding study catalogue no 0644 (MClr); no
0447 (MC3r); no 0420 (MC3r) and no 0448 (Mc5r) Cerep,
France. In all experiments the Ki values are calculated based
on the ability of the test compound to displace 125I-NDP-
aMSH. The test items are tested in a concentration range of
10’13 to 1075 M,

[0396] For agonist activity against the MCRs the follow-
ing procedures are conducted: The cells are incubated with
test item at concentrations from 10'” to l0‘5 Mi In all
assays CAMP accumulation is determined after incubation
and the response at a given concentration is expressed as a
percent of the maximal control speciﬁc agonist response
(measured speciﬁc response/control speciﬁc agonist
response)><100) when NDP-otMSH is used as positive con-
trol, The EC50 values (concentration producing a half-
maximal speciﬁc response) are determined by non-linear
regression analysis of the concentration-response curves
generated with mean replicate values using Hill equation
curve ﬁtting (Y:D+[(A—D)/(1+(C/C50)nH)], where
Y:speciﬁc response, Dminimum speciﬁc response,
A:maximum speciﬁc response, C:compound concentra-
tion, and C50 :ECSO, and nH:slope factor). For further
details see the speciﬁc protocols for Cerep study protocol no
2147 (MClr); no 0959 (MC3r), no 0699 (MC4r) and no
1869 (MC5r).

[0437] All three analogues showed full agonist activity
when compared to the control peptide GLP-2 (1-34) with
EC50 values in the nM range. Consequently the current
examples of BAP modiﬁed GLP-Z analogues are full and
potent agonists against the human GLP-2 receptor.

AnxAl N-Terminal Fragments

[0438] Method:

[0439] Recombinant cells co-expressing mitochondrial
apoaequirin and recombinant human type 2 Formyl peptide
receptor (FPRZ) were grown for 18 hours prior to testing in
media without antibiotics were detached by gentle ﬂushing
with PBS-EDTA (5 mM EDTA), recovered by centrifuga-
tion and re-suspended in assay buﬁer (DHEM/HAM’s F12
with HEPES and 01% protease free BSA). Cells were then
incubated for at least 4 hours at room temperature coelen-
terazine h (from Molecular Probes) before DR studies were
conducted.

[0440] 50 p1 of cell suspension was injected on 50 ul of the
test or control compound (solubilized in PBS/0.5% BSA and
ﬁnally diluted from a stock solution of 1 mM) at increasing
concentrations in 96 wells plates and then incubated 30 min
at room temperature. The resulting light emission was
recorded using the Hamamatsu functional drug Screening
system 6000 (FDSSéOOO). For standardization of emission

[0445] Results:

[0446] In the literature both the AnxAl (2-12) and the
AnxAl (2-26) N-terminal fragments of the AnxAl protein
are described as agonist to the FPR2 receptor-none of them
as signiﬁcantly potent, but the in the setting neither control
peptide 1 or 2 were able to induce agonist activity in the
applied concentration range. In contrast to this both ana-
logue 6 and analogue 7 showed agonist activity. For Ana-
logue 6 the agonist activity reached 33% of the max
response seen with the internal control compound Tip-Lys-
Tyr-Met-Val-Met, The corresponding maximal activity of
control compound 1 was less than 1%. For analogue 7, ECso
was determined to 1.56 uM. The maximal agonist response
obtained at the highest tested dose was 85% of the max
response obtained with the Trp-Lys—Tyr-Met-Val-Met hexa-
peptide, whereas the maximal activity of control peptide was
less than 1%.

[0340] Systemic Treatment

[0341] In one embodiment, the route of administration
allows for introducing the peptide analogue into the blood
stream to ultimately target the sites of desired action.
[0342] In one embodiment the routes of administration is
any suitable routes, such as an enteral route (including the
oral, rectal, nasal, pulmonary, buccal, sublingual, transder-
mal, intracisternal and intraperitoneal administration), and/
or a parenteral route (including subcutaneous, intramuscular,
intrathecal, intravenous and intradermal administration).
[0343] Appropriate dosage forms for such administration
may be prepared by conventional techniques,

[0344] Parenteral Administration

[0345] Parenteral administration is any administration
route not being the oral/enteral route whereby the medica-
ment avoids ﬁrst-pass degradation in the liver. Accordingly,
parenteral administration includes any injections and infu-
sions, for example bolus injection or continuous infusion,
such as intravenous administration, intramuscular adminis-
tration or subcutaneous administration. Furthermore, paren-
teral administration includes inhalations and topical admiri-
istration.

[0346] Accordingly, the peptide analogue or composition
is in one embodiment administered topically to cross any
mucosal membrane of an animal to which the substance or
peptide is to be given, e,g. in the nose, vagina, eye, mouth,
genital tract, lungs, gastrointestinal tract, or rectum, for
example the mucosa of the nose, or mouth, and accordingly,
parenteral administration may also include buccal, sublin-
gual, nasal, rectal, vaginal and intraperitoneal administration
as well as pulmonal and bronchial administration by inha-
lation or installation. In some embodiments, the peptide
analogue is administered topically to cross the skin.
[0347] In one embodiment, the intravenous, subcutaneous
and intramuscular forms of parenteral administration are
employed.

[0348] Local Treatment

[0349] In one embodiment, the peptide analogue or com-
position according to the invention is used as a local
treatment, i,e. is introduced directly to the site(s) of action.
Accordingly, the peptide may be applied to the skin or
mucosa directly, or the peptide may be injected into the site
of action, for example into the diseased tissue or to an end
artery leading directly to the diseased tissue.

[0350] PharmaceuticalFormulations

[0351] In one embodiment the peptide analogues or phar-
maceutically acceptable derivatives thereof are administered
alone or in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable
carriers or excipients, in either single or multiple doses. The
pharmaceutical compositions or compounds according to
the invention may be formulated with pharmaceutically
acceptable carriers or diluents as well as any other known
adjuvants and excipients in accordance with conventional
techniques, such as those disclosed in Remington: The
Science and Practice of Pharmacy, 20'” Edition, Gennaro,
Ed., Mack Publishing C0,, Easton, Pa., 2000.

[0352] The term “pharmaceutically acceptable derivative’
in present context includes pharmaceutically acceptable
salts, which indicate a salt which is not harmful to the
patient. Such salts include pharmaceutically acceptable
basic or acid addition salts as well as pharmaceutically
acceptable metal salts, ammonium salts and alkylated
ammonium salts. A pharmaceutically acceptable derivative
further includes pharmaceutically acceptable esters, prod-

rugs, or other precursors of a compound which may be
biologically metabolized into the active compound, or crys-
tal forms of a compound.

[0353] The pharmaceutical composition or pharmaceuti-
cally acceptable composition may be speciﬁcally formulated
for administration by any suitable route, such as an enteral
route, the oral, rectal, nasal, pulmonary, buccal, sublingual,
transdermal, intracistemal, intraperitoneal, and parenteral
(including subcutaneous, intramuscular, intrathecal, intrave-
nous and intradermal) route.

[0354] In an embodiment of the present invention, the
pharmaceutical compositions or peptides of the present
invention are fonnulated for crossing the blood-brain-bar-
rier.

[0355] Pharmaceutical compositions for oral administra-
tion include solid dosage forms such as hard or soft capsules,
tablets, troches, dragees, pills, lozenges, powders and gran-
ules. Where appropriate, they can be prepared with coatings
such as enteric coatings, or they can be formulated so as to
provide controlled release of the active ingredient, such as
sustained or prolonged release, according to methods well
known in the art. In the same solid dosage form two active
ingredients may be combined so as to provide controlled
release of one active ingredient and immediate release of
another active ingredient.

[0356] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration
include solutions, emulsions, aqueous or oily suspensions,
syrups and elixirs.

[0357] Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral admin-
istration include sterile aqueous and non-aqueous injectable
solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions, as well as
sterile powders to be reconstituted in sterile injectable
solutions or dispersions prior to use. Depot injectable for-
mulations are also regarded as being within the scope of the
present invention.

[0358] Other suitable administration forms include sup-
positories, sprays, ointrnents, cremes/lotions, gels. inhalants,
dermal patches, implants, etc.

[0359] In one embodiment, a compound or peptide for use
according to the present invention is generally utilized as the
free substance or as a pharmaceutically derivative such as a
pharmaceutically acceptable ester or such as a salt thereof.
Examples of the latter are: an acid addition salt of a
compound having a free base functionality, and a base
addition salt of a compound having a free acid functionality,
The term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to a
non-toxic salt of a compound for use according to the
present invention, which salts are generally prepared by
reacting a free base with a suitable organic or inorganic acid,
or by reacting an acid with a suitable organic or inorganic
base, When a compound for use according to the present
invention contains a free base functionality, such salts are
prepared in a conventional manner by treating a solution or
suspension of the compound with a chemical equivalent of
a pharmaceutically acceptable acid. \Vhen a compound for
use according to the present invention contains a free acid
functionality, such salts are prepared in a conventional
manner by treating a solution or suspension of the com-
pound with a chemical equivalent of a pharmaceutically
acceptable base, Physiologically acceptable salts of a com-
pound with a hydroxy group include the anionic form of the
compound in combination with a suitable cation, such as
sodium or ammonium ion. Other salts which are not phar-
maceutically acceptable may be useful in the preparation of

Pharmacological Characterization of BAP-Modiﬁed
GLP-l Analogues

[0420] Method:

[0421] CHO-K1 cells expressing the human GLP-l recep-
tor grown in media without antibiotic were detached by
gentle ﬂushing with PBS-EDTA (5 mM EDTA), recovered
by centrifugation and resuspended in assay buffer (KRH: 5
mM KCl, 1.25 mM MgSO4, 124 mM NaCl, 25 mM HEPES,
13.3 mM Glucose, 1.25 mM KHZPO4, 1.45 mM CaClZ, 0.5
g/l BSA),

[0422] 12 [Ll of cells were mixed with 12 [Ll of the test
compound (solubilized in PBS/0.5% BSA and ﬁnally diluted
from a stock solution of 1 mM) at increasing concentrations
in 96 wells plates and then incubated 30 min at room
temperature cAMP production was determined after addi-
tion of a lysis buﬁer and 1 hour incubation, by use of
competitive immunoassay using cryptate-labeled anti-
cAMP and d2-labeled cAMP (HTRF kit from CisBio) with
Delta F percentage values calculated according to the manu-
facturer speciﬁcation. Dose response curves were performed
in parallel with test compounds, and reference compounds.
[0423] The HTRF technology is a titration assay based on
a competition between labeled CAMP (exogenous) and
CAMP produced by the cell after activation of the MCr. The
dynamic range of the assay was 3-4 fold meaning that the
linear range (which enables conversion from raw data to nM
of cAMP) is within that range. The window between top and
bottom of the curve is higher (around 100) which means that
converting into nM of CAMP, the assay window of CAMP
goes from 1 nM (basal) to around 30 nM (Ema). All
experiments were conducted ill the presence of the non-
selective phosphodiesterase inhibitor IBMX (1 mM in ﬁnal
concentration).

[0424] The test compounds were tested in a concentration
range from 10'14 to 10‘7 M

[0425] Data is presented as mean values. The EC50 (ie the
concentration induced 50% of max response) and the hill
slope were determined by best ﬁt analyses after logarithmic
transformation using the graph pad software (version 6.0).

Synthesis of BAP Modiﬁed Peptides

[0409] Similarly the synthesis of BAP modiﬁed ot-MSH
peptide analogues (Example 1) peptides were synthesized
using standard Fmoc chemistry using 1-[Bis(dimethyl-
amino)rnethylene]- l H-l ,2,3-triazolo [4,5-b]pyridinium
3-oxid hexaﬂuorophosphate (HATU) or 2-(6-Chloro-1H-
benzotriazole-l -yl)-l ,l ,3,3-tetrarnethylaminiurn hexaﬂuo-
rophosphate (HCTU) as the coupling reagents with Hunig’s
Base (N,N-diisopropylethylamine, DIPEA) For the lysine
branching as described in more detail below, combination of
orthogonally protected lysines were used including Fmoc-
Lys(MTT)—OH, Fmoc-Lys(idee)—OH , and Fmoc-Lys
(Boc)-OH,

[0410] Peptides were cleaved with standard cleavage
cocktails including triﬂuoroacetic acid, triisoproproylsilane,
and water and precipitated with ice-cold ethen All crude
peptides were puriﬁed by reversed-phase chromatography
on columns with C-18 functionality and using gradients of
acetonitrile, deionized water, and triﬂuoroacetic acid as
running buﬁers. Purity was determined by high-pressure
liquid chromatography and mass (MS) and sequence (tan-
dem MS) information was obtained using a nanospray mass
spectrometer.

[0411] BAP Attached in the C-Terrninus of the Sequence

[0412] Branching on the C-tenninal lysine (METHOD 1):
N-ot-Fmoc-N—s-4-methyltrityl-L-lysine was added to Rink
amide resin aﬁer piperidine deprotection. The remaining
sequence of the target peptide was added and the full length
sequence was acetylated with acetic anhydride, The meth-
yltrityl group was then removed using l% triﬂuomacetic
acid in dichloromethane. Additional Not-Fmoc-NE-Boc-L-
lysine was then added to the side chain and acetylated when
desired

[0413] Branching on other than the C-terminal lysine:
analogously to attaching BAP to lysines in the sequence
between the N- and C-tennini (METHOD 2).

[0414] BAP Attached to Lysines in the Sequence Between
the N— and C-Termini

[0415] METHOD 2: N-ot-Fmoc-N—s-4-methyltrityl-L-1y-
sine was added to the peptide sequence, methytrityl was
removed after ﬁnalizing the sequence and optionally N-ter-
minal acetylation) Appropriate lysine analogues such as
Fmoc-Lys(MTT)—OH, Fmoc-Lys(idee)—OH and Fmoc-Lys
(Boc)—0H were sequentially added and selectively depro-
tected, before acetylation to ensure appropriate side chain
and acetyl addition.

[0416] BAP Attached in the N-Terminus of the Sequence

[0417] Branching on the N-terminal lysine (METHOD 3):
N-a-Fmoc-N—s-4-methyltrityl-L—lysine was added to N-ter-
minal of the sequence, Fmoc was removed, the sequence
acetylated at the N—terminus, and the metyltrityl group was
removed, Additional Na-Fmoc-Nc-Boc-L-lysine was then
added to the side chain and acetylated when desired

[0306] Methods of Preparation

[0307] The peptide analogues according to the present
invention may be prepared by any suitable methods known
in the art. Thus, in some embodiments the peptide and the
branched amino acid probe are each prepared by standard
peptide-preparation techniques, such as solution synthesis or
solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS) such as Merriﬁeld-type
solid phase synthesis

[0308] The peptide analogues of the invention are in one
embodiment prepared by solid phase synthesis by ﬁrst
constructing the pharrnacologically active peptide sequence,
using well-known standard protection, coupling and de-
protection procedures, thereafter sequentially coupling the
branched amino acid probe onto the active peptide in a
manner similar to the construction of the active peptide, and
ﬁnally cleaving otT the entire peptide analogue from the
carrier. This strategy yields a peptide, wherein the branched
US 2019/0030115 A1

amino acid probe is covalently bound to the pharmacologi-
cally active peptide at the N—terminal nitrogen atom of the
peptide.

[0309] In one embodiment, the alpha nitrogen on the ﬁnal
amino acid in the branched amino acid sequence is capped
with acetyl, using standard acylation techniques, prior to or
aﬁer coupling of the branched amino acid sequence on the
active peptide.

[0310] Reactive moieties at the N- and C-termini, which
facilitates amino acid coupling during synthesis. as well as
reactive side chain functional groups, can interact with free
termini or other side chain groups during synthesis and
peptide elongation and negatively inﬂuence yield and purity
Chemical groups are thus developed that bind to speciﬁc
amino acid functional groups and block, or protect, the
functional group from nonspeciﬁc reactions. Puriﬁed, indi-
vidual amino acids are reacted with these protecting groups
prior to synthesis and then selectively removed during
speciﬁc steps of peptide synthesis. Examples of N-terminal
protecting groups are t-Boc and Fmoc, commonly used in
solid-phase peptide synthesis. C-terminal protecting groups
are mostly used in liquid-phase synthesis Because N—ter-
minal deprotection occurs continuously during peptide syn-
thesis, protecting schemes have been established in which
the diiferent types of side chain protecting groups (benzyl;
B2] or tert-butyl;tBu) are matched to either Boc or Fmoc,
respectively, for optimized deprotection.

[0311] In a particular embodiment of the invention, when
preparing the branched amino acid probe, exampliﬁed by
Ac(Ac-Lys—Lys)Lys-, the protection group for Lys is Mtt,
which protected amino acid is commercially available
(Fmoc-Lys(Mtt)—OH; N-ot-Fmoc-N—s-4-methyltrityl-L-ly-
sine, CAS# 167393-62-6), Lys(Mtt) allows for capping Lys
with acetyl as it is not cleaved under the conditions that
cleave Fmoc, and may be removed without cleavage of other
side chain protection groups.

[0312] The method of preparation is in some embodiments
optimized by routine methods in the art that may increase the
yield and/or quality of the thus prepared synthetic peptide,
For instance, use of pseudoproline (oxazolidine) dipeptides
in the Fmoc SPPS of serine- and threonine-containing
peptides may lead to improvements in quality and yield of
crude products and may help avoid unnecessary repeat
synthesis of failed sequences. These dipeptides are easy to
use: simply substitute a serine or threonine residue together
with the preceding amino acid residue in the peptide
sequence with the appropriate pseudoproline dipeptide. The
native sequence is regenerated on cleavage and deprotec-
tion,

[0313] In one embodiment the sequence of the pharma-
cologically active peptide and the branched amino acid
probe (or parts thereof) are each prepared separately by for
example solution synthesis, solid phase synthesis, recombi-
nant techniques, or enzymatic synthesis, followed by cou-
pling of the (at least) two sequences by well-known segment
condensation procedures, either in solution or using solid
phase techniques, or a combination thereof

[0314] In one embodiment, the peptides are prepared by
recombinant DNA methods and the branched amino acid
probe is prepared by solid or solution phase synthesis, The
conjugation of the peptide and the branched amino acid
probe is in one embodiment carried out by using chemical
ligation, This technique allows for the assembling of totally
unprotected peptide segments in a highly speciﬁc manner, In

Jan. 3], 2019

another embodiment, the conjugation is performed by pro-
tease-catalysed peptide bond formation, which offers a
highly speciﬁc technique to combine totally unprotected
peptide segments via a peptide bond,

[0315] In one embodiment, the C-terminal amino acid of
the branched amino acid probe or the C-terminal amino acid
of the peptide is attached to the solid support material by
means of a common linker such as 2,4-dimethoxy-4‘-hy-
droxy-benzophenone, 4-(4-hydroxy-methyl-3-methoxyphe-
noxy)—butyric acid, 4-hydroxy-methylbenzoic acid, 4-hy-
droxymethyl-phenoxyacetic acid, 3-(4-
hydroxymethylphenoxy)propionic acid, or p-{(R,S)-ot-[l-
(9H-Fluoren -9-yl)-methoxyformamido]-2,4-
dimethoxybenzyl}-phenoxyacetic acid (Rink amide linker).
[0316] Examples of suitable solid support materials
(SSM) are e.g,, functionalised resins such as polystyrene,
polyacrylamide, polydimethylacrylamide, polyethylenegly-
col, cellulose, polyethylene, polyethyleneglycol grafted on
polystyrene, latex, dynabeads, etc,

[0317] The produced peptide analogues of the invention
are in some embodiment cleaved from the solid support
material by means of an acid such as triﬂuoracetic acid,
triﬂuoromethanesulfonic acid, hydrogen bromide, hydrogen
chloride, hydrogen ﬂuoride, etc. optionally in combination
with one phenol, thioanisole, etc., or the peptide conjugate
of the invention are in other embodiments cleaved from the
solid support by means of a base such as ammonia, hydra-
zine, an alkoxide, such as sodium ethoxide, an hydroxide,
such as sodium hydroxide, etc,

[0318] In other embodiments, the peptide analogues of the
invention may be prepared or produced by recombinant
techniques, Thus, in one aspect of the present invention the
peptide is produced by host cells comprising a ﬁrst nucleic
acid sequence encoding the peptide or peptide analogue
operably associated with a second nucleic acid capable of
directing expression in said host cells, In some embodiments
the second nucleic acid sequence comprises or even consists
of a promoter that will direct the expression of protein of
interest in said cells. A skilled person will be readily capable
of identifying useful second nucleic acid sequences (erg.
vectors and plasmids) for use in a given host cell,

[0319] The process of producing a recombinant peptide in
general comprises the steps of: providing a host cell, pre-
paring a gene expression construct comprising a ﬁrst nucleic
acid encoding the peptide operably linked to a second
nucleic acid capable of directing expression of said protein
of interest in the ho st cell, transforming the ho st cell with the
construct and cultivating the host cell, thereby obtaining
expression of the peptide, In one embodiment of the inven-
tion, the recombinantly produced peptide is excreted by the
host cells, The host cell include any suitable host cell known
in the art, including prokaryotic cells, yeast cells, insect cells
and mammalian cells.

[0320] In one embodiment, the recombinant peptide thus
produced is isolated by any conventional method and may
be linked via conventional peptide bond forming chemistry
to any suitably protected branched amino peptide moiety.
The skilled person will be able to identify suitable protein
isolation steps for purifying the peptide.

[0212] In one embodiment the peptide analogue comprises
an Annexin protein, including in one embodiment annexin
A-I (lipocortin I) and annexin A-II (annexin II), or variants
thereof, including thereof, some of which are known in the
art.

[0213] Agonist

[0214] In one embodiment the peptide analogue of the
invention comprises an agonist, The term “agonist" in the
present context refers to a substance or peptide as deﬁned
herein, capable of binding to, or in some embodiments,
capable of binding to at least some extent and/or activating

a receptor, or in some embodiments, activating a receptor to
at least some extent,

[0215] An agonist may be an agonist of several different
types of receptors, and thus capable of binding and/or
activating several different types of receptors. Said agonist
can also be a selective agonist which only binds and acti-
vates one type of receptor. The term “antagonist" in the
present context refers to a substance capable of inhibiting
the eﬁect of a receptor agonist,

[0216] Full agonists bind (have aﬂinity for) and activate a
receptor, displaying full eﬂlcacy at that receptor. “Partial
agonists” in the present context are peptides able to bind and
activate a given receptor, but having only partial efﬁcacy at
the receptor relative to a full agonist, Partial agonists can act
as antagonists when competing with a full agonist for
receptor occupancy and producing a net decrease in the

Jan. 3], 2019

receptor activation compared to the effects or activation
observed with the full agonist alone.

[0217] “Selective agonists” in the present context are
compounds which are selective and therefore predominantly
bind and activate one type of receptor,

[0218] Peptides according to the present invention are in
one embodiment an agonist capable of binding and activat-
ing to some extent one or several receptors and can have
different binding afﬁnities and/or different receptor activa-
tion eﬁicacy for dilferent receptors, wherein aﬁinity refers to
the number and size of intermolecular forces between a
peptide ligand and its receptor, and residence time of the
ligand at its receptor binding site; and receptor activation
eﬂicacy refers to the ability of the peptide ligand to produce
a biological response upon binding to the target receptor and
the quantitative magnitude of this response,

[0219] In some embodiments, such differences in aﬂinity
and receptor activation eﬂicacy are determined by receptor
binding/activation studies which are conventional in the art,
for instance by generating ECSD and Emax values for stimu-
lation of ligand binding in cells expressing one or several
types of receptors, or on tissues expressing the dilferent
types of receptors. High aﬂinity means that a lower concen-
tration of a compound is needed to obtain a binding of 50%
of the receptors compared to peptides which have lower
aﬂinity; high receptor activation eﬂ'icacy means that a lower
concentration of the peptide is needed to obtain a 50%
receptor activation response (low EC50 value), compared to
peptides which have lower aﬁinity and/or receptor activity
eﬁicacy (higher EC 50 value).

[0220] Melanocortins

[0221] In one embodiment the peptide of the peptide
analogue of the invention is a melanocortin.

[0222] In one embodiment the melanocortin is selected
from a-MSH, y-MSH (comprising yl-MSIi and y-MSH)
and B-MSH, or variants thereof,

[0223] In one embodiment the melanocortin is selected
from ot-MSH and y-MSH, or variants thereof

[0224] In one embodiment, a peptide variant is a biologi-
cally active variant of the peptide, iie, a variant which retains
at least one function of the native (non-variant) peptide,

PEPTIDE ANALOGUES WITH BRANCIIED
AMINO ACID PROBE(S)

CROSS-REFERENCE

[0001] This application claims the beneﬁt of U181 Provi-
sional Application No. 61/982,709, ﬁled Apr 22, 2014,
which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety.

FIELD OF INVENTION

[0002] The present invention relates to branched amino
acid probes which are added to native peptides, or variants
of said peptides, to produce peptide analogues or conjugates
comprising a peptide and one or more branched amino acid
probesr

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] Proteins and peptides are widely employed for
therapeutic purposes whether in their native forms, variant
forms or analogues thereof. Protein therapeutics tend to be
speciﬁc for their targets, leading to potentially fewer side
effects, but often with lower bioavailability, poorer mem-
brane permeability, and metabolic instability, as compared to
small molecules Protein-based drugs are generally referred
to as ‘biologics’ and include molecules such as insulin,
growth factors, and engineered antibodies.

[0004] Proteinaceous molecules typically require injec-
tion; nevertheless, biologics have been an extremely suc-
cessful class of therapeutics including antibodies for treat-
ment of arthritis and various cancers, soluble proteins for
diabetes, myelosuppression and renal anemia; as well as
short injectable peptides for multiple sclerosis, cancers,
endometriosis and ﬁbroids and acromegaly.

[0005] Peptides represent a class of molecules that have
the speciﬁcity and potency of larger protein biologics, but
are smaller in size and more accessible and cheaper to
manufacture using chemical methods, thus potentially com-
bining some of the advantages of proteins with those of
small molecules.

[0006] Protein and peptide compounds can be modiﬁed in
various ways in order to improve one or more features of the
compound, or address one or more potential draw-backs of
the compound. For example, a stabilizing peptide sequence
may be added to the N- and/or C-terminus of pharmaco-
logically active peptides potentially making them less sus-
ceptible to degradation (WO 99/46283). Furt er, a linear
amino acid probe of 6 amino acids selected from Lys or Glu
added to the N-terminus of d-MSH potentially increases
efﬁcacy compared to the native peptide (WO 07/22774),
Known peptide-drug conjugates ﬁir‘ther include addition of
polycationic peptides CPP (cell-penetrating eptides) to
improve transport across the cell lipid bi-layer,

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

[0007] The present invention provides peptice analogues
comprising a peptide or protein, native or naturally occur-
ring, or biologically active variants thereof, and one or more
branched amino acid probes (abbreviated BAP herein),
Modiﬁcation of peptides by addition of one or more
branched amino acid probes has not previous y been dis-
closed.
[0008] In some embodiments, the peptide analogues pro-
vided herein have one or more improved pro erties com-
pared to the native peptide. For example, in some embodi-

 

Jan. 31, 2019

ments, addition of one or more branched amino acid probes
to a peptide potentially improves one or more features of the
peptide, such as

[0009] improve or increase an inherent eifect of the
peptide (including for example increasing the activity,
aﬁinity and/or etﬁcacy of a pharmacologically active
peptide; improved binding to and/or activation of one
or more relevant receptors);

[0010] alter an inherent effect of the peptide (including
for example an altered receptor binding proﬁle), or

[0011] improve or alter an external effect of the peptide
(including for example increased stability, reduced
degradation, altered conﬁguration and/or altered solu-
bility),

[0012] Thus, the present invention relates to a peptide
analogue comprising a peptide and one or more branched
amino acid probes,

[0013] wherein said branched amino acid probe comprises
a ﬁrst amino-alkyl amino acid residue, said ﬁrst amino-
alkyl amino acid residue optionally being covalently
linked to a second amino-alkyl amino acid residue, or to
a second and a third amino-alkyl amino acid residue, to
form a linear chain of 2 or 3 amino-alkyl amino acid
residues,

[0014] wherein the side chain(s) of one or more of said
ﬁrst, second and/or third amino-alkyl amino acid residues
are each modiﬁed by attaching to the side chain amino
group a molecule independently selected from the group
consisting of AAAq-AAA; (aa3)P-AAAq; AAAq-(aa3)p;
[(333)-AAA11, and [AAA-(833m;

[0015] wherein q is a number selected from 0, 1, 2 and 3;
p is a number selected from 1, 2 and 3; AAA is an
amino-alkyl amino acid residue; and (aa,) is an amino
acid residue independently selected from Arg, His, Gly
and Ala,

[0016] wherein said amino-alkyl amino acid residues are
optionally acetylated,

[0017] wherein said ﬁrst amino-alkyl amino acid residue is
covalently linked to the N-terminus of said peptide,
covalently linked to the C-terminus of said peptide, and/or
attached to the side chain amino group of an amino-alkyl
amino acid residue within said peptide,

[0018] with the proviso that said branched amino acid
probe consists of 2 to 9 amino acid residues.

[0019] The present invention also encompasses pharma-
ceutical compositions comprising the peptide analogues of
the present invention, as well as the analogues of the present
invention for use as a medicament.

FIELD

[0002] This invention is generally in the ﬁeld of drug
delivery related to both small molecule and macromolecular
drugs, More particularly it is related to 2,5-diketopiperazine
salts, their use in the formulation of such drugs including
therapeutic, prophylactic and diagnostic agents, stabilizing
agents and systems for their delivery.

BACKGROUND TO THE INVENTION

[0003] Drug delivery has been a persistent challenge in the
pharmaceutical arts, particularly when a drug is unstable
and/or poorly absorbed at the locus in the body to which it
is administered, One such class of drugs includes 2,5-
diketopiperazines, which is represented by the compound of
the general Formula 1 as shown below where E:N,

R1 EEO

01/: E; R]
These 2,5 diketopiperazines have been shown to be useful in
drug delivery, particularly those bearing acidic R groups (see
for example US. Pat, No 5,352,461 entitled “Self Assem-
bling Diketopiperazine Drug Delivery System;” US. Pat,
No. 5,503,852 entitled “Method For Making Self-Assem-
bling Diketopiperazine Drug Delivery System,” US Pat,
No. 6,071,497 entitled “Microparticles For Lung Delivery
Comprising Diketopiperazine,” and US. Pat. No, 6,331,318
entitled “Carbon-Substituted Diketopiperazine Delivery
System,” each of which is incorporated herein by reference
in its entirety for all that it teaches regarding diketopipera-
zines and diketopiperazine-mediated drug delivery), Dike-
topiperazines can be formed into particles that incorporate a
drug or particles onto which a drug can be adsorbed, The
combination of a drug and a diketopiperazine can impart
improved drug stability. These particles can be administered
by various routes of administration, As dry powders these

particles can be delivered by inhalation to speciﬁc areas of
the respiratory system, depending on particle size. Addition-

ally, the particles can be made small enough for incorpora-
tion into an intravenous suspension dosage form, Oral
delivery is also possible with the particles incorporated into
a suspension, tablets or capsules; or dissolved in an appro-
priate solventr Diketopiperazines may also facilitate absorp-
tion of an associated drug. Nonetheless diﬁiculties can arise
when diketopiperazines are diacids, or are in diacid form(s),
due to the limited solubility of these diacids at non-basic pH
(i.e,, neutral or acid pH). Another difﬁculty arises because
these diacid diketopiperazines may form disadvantageous
association(s) with some drugs,

[0004] Therefore there is a need for diketopiperazine
compositions having greater solubility at a neutral and/or
acidic pH and methods for their use in the manufacture of
therapeutic compositions,

Example 16. Characteristics of Spray Dried
Microparticles

[0161] Spray dried FDKP salt/insulin particles demon-
strate a surprising and unexpected trend in aerodynamic
performance. Previously observed insulin-containing
microparticles, which had been formed from DKP free acid
microparticles onto which insulin had been loaded and the
solvent removed by lyophilization, demonstrated decreased
aerodynamic performance with increasing insulin content.
For example, the “/0 rf (respirable fraction) for 25% loaded
particles was signiﬁcantly lower than the % rf for 5% loaded
particles. For spray dried FDKP salt microparticles contain-
ing insulin, the opposite trend is observed. As insulin load
increases, % rf increases

[0162] Spray dried powders of the FDKP disodium salt
were prepared with insulin contents of 11.4%, 50.0%,
70.0%, or 90.0% (w:w). FIG. 16 shows that % rf increases
with increasing insulin load.

[0163] A similar trend was also observed in spray dried
FDKP diammonium salt/insulin powders having insulin
contents of 11.4%, 50.0%, 70.0%, or 90.0% (w:w). The %
rf increased with insulin load (FIG. 17).

[0164] The starting concentration of the FDKP disodium
salt solution prior to spray drying was evaluated for its elfect
on ﬁnal particle insulin stability. The data indicate that
insulin stability in the powder increases with increasing
solution concentrations as measured by insulin loss after 17
days at 40°/75% RH. For example, 8.5% insulin was lost
from powder spray dried from a solution containing 37
mg/mL solids. By comparison, 45% insulin was lost from
powder spray dried from a solution containing 45 mg/mL
solids and 2.7% insulin was lost from powder spray dried
from a solution containing 67 mg/mL solids.

[0165] The inlet temperatures used to spray dry solutions
of the FDKP disodium salt and insulin to form particles
containing 50% insulin was evaluated for its effect on ﬁnal
particle insulin stability. The data indicate that insulin sta-
bility in the powder increases with increasing inlet tempera-
ture as measured by insulin loss aﬁer 17 days at 40°/75%
RH. For example, about 4% insulin was lost from powder
spray dried at an inlet temperature of 180° C. By compari-
son, <1% insulin was lost from powder spray dried at an
inlet temperature of 200° C.

[0166] Additionally, the present inventors have unex-
pected found that these particles, which are suitable for
pulmonary delivery, have a rugosity of approximately 1.

[0140] Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was utilized
to study particle morphology, A representative SEM is
shown in FIG. 3, The particle morphology is consistent with
a collapsed hollow sphere.

[0141] The stability of the disodium salt/insulin particles
was evaluated under accelerated room temperature condi-
tions (40°/75% relative humidity [RH]). Compared to a
control formulation prepared by lyophilization, the spray-
dried particles demonstrated superior insulin stability as
measured by insulin degradation (FIG, 4).

[0142] Tie starting concentration of the FDKP disodium
salt/25% insulin solution prior to spray drying was evaluated
for its effect on ﬁnal particle stability. The data (FIG. 5)
shows that insulin stability on the particle increases with
increasing solution concentrations as measured by insulin
loss after 7 days at 40°/75% RH.

[0143] Tie precipitation was controlled using harmonic
ultrasonic atomization. Alternate cavitation methods as well
as high shear mixing and homogenization are also appli-
cable.
[0144] Tie disodium salt of FDKP (5 g) was dissolved in
deionized water (80 mL). Insulin (0.65 g) was added to the
solution to produce a suspension. The pH of the suspension
was adjusted to 8.3 with NHAOH to obtain a solution that
was dilute to 100 mL with deionized water and ﬁltered. The
particles were precipitated by pumping the insulin/disodium

salt of FDKP solution and ethanol in a 1:5 ratio through a
duel inlet atomization horn vibrating at a frequency between
20 kHz and 40 kHz. The precipitate was collected in a media
bottle containing ethanol (200 rnL). Post-precipitation the
material was washed with ethanol and dried via rotary
evaporation or by bubbling nitrogen through the suspension.
The particles contained 12.5% insulin by weight. Particle
morphology was evaluated by SEM (FIGS, 6A, 6B. 6C, and
6D).

[0145] The particles illustrated in FIG. 6A (10 kx) and
FIG. 6B (20Kx) are in the l to 5 micron range while at lower
magniﬁcation (FIG. 6C, 25 k>< and FIG. 6D, 1.0 kx)
particles in the 10 to 40 micron range are seen. It is the
non-binding hypothesis of the present inventors that the
drying methods utilized in this study resulted in recrystal-
ization of the primary particles into much larger secondary

particles and that the use of a method that maintains a
constant ratio of organic to aqueous components throughout
the drying process, such as spray drying, can preserve the
primary particles to the exclusion of the formation of a
signiﬁcant number of secondary particles.

Example 15. In Situ Diarnmonium Salt Formation
and Formulation

[0146] FDKP or SDKP (succinyl DKP) diamrnoniurn salt/
insulin particles were formed by spray drying. A represen-
tative procedure is given for the FDKP ammonium salt/
insulin formulation containing 25% insulin.

[0147] FDKP (5 g) was suspended in deionized water (150
mL) and titrated to a pH of 7.5 to 8.0 with ammonium
hydroxide (NHAOH). Insulin (1.69 g) was added to the
resulting solution (FDKP) to give a suspension. The pH of
the suspension was adjusted to 8.3 with ammonium hydrox-
ide (NH40H) to give a solution that was diluted to 200 mL
with deionized water and ﬁltered. The powder was produced
by spray drying the solution under the following conditions.

[0148] Inlet temperature7200° C.

[0149] Outlet temperature780° C,

[0150] Atomization gas7600 liter N2/hr

[0151] Process gas780% of maximum

[0152] The spray nozzle was cooled to 28° C.

[0153] The % r‘f of the diarnmoniurn salts is about 10%

higher than the % rfof the disodium salt. The counter cation
has a large eﬁect on particle performance. Also, the 50%
FDKP ammonium salt/ insulin powder has a % rf comparable
to that of the corresponding 25% FDKP ammonium salt/

insulin powden This is surprising because with the powders
prepared by lyophilization from the FDKP free acid7 the %
rf decreases as the insulin content increases.

[0154] The resultant particles were analyzed for their
aerodynamic properties and the data are reported in Table 5.

Example 8. Characterization of Disodium
FDKP-Insulin Microparticles

[0122] The microparticles described in Examples 6 and 7
were subjected to laser diffraction particle size analysis
(SympatechbH, Germany) (FIGS. 1A and 13). The par-
ticles of Example 6 displayed an average respirable fraction
(according to the USP deﬁnition of 0.5 to 5.8 microns) of
87.93% with a standard deviation of 1.60 and a % CV
(coefﬁcient of variation) of 1.82. The particles of Example
7 displayed an average respirable fraction of 81.36% with a
standard deviation of 4.20 and a % CV of 5.16.

Example 9. Pulmonary Administration of Disodium
FDKP-Insulin

[0123] A dry powder containing the disodium FDKP salt
and insulin is inhaled at the beginning of meal. The particles
that comprise the dry powder are preferably in the range of
approximately 0.5-5.8 microns in size. The exact dosage is
patient-speciﬁc, but generally on the order of 5-150 Units of
insulin per dose. The insulin absorption from this dosage
regimen mimics physiologic ﬁrst-phase insulin release, and
attenuates post-prandial blood glucose excursions.

[0124] Spray-dried disodium FDKP/insulin powder as
described in Examples 6 or 7 is packed into hard gelatin
capsules. The capsules can contain approximately 50-100
mg of powder. The FDKP salt/insulin powders prepared in
Examples 6 and 7 were 25% insulin by weight and insulin
activity was about 26 units/mg. Thus, 50 mg would be on the
order of 1300 units, signiﬁcantly larger than a typical dose.
About 2-30 mg of the FDKP salt/insulin powder is mixed
with methyl cellulose (other bulking agents are well known
in the art) to make up the balance of the desired mass.

Example 11. Oral Administration of Disodium
FDKP-Insulin

[0125] Capsules containing the FDKP salt and insulin are
taken before a meal. The exact dosage is patient-speciﬁc, but
generally on the order of approximately 10-150 units of
insulin is administered per dose. The subsequent insulin
absorption attenuates post-prandial blood glucose excur-
sions. This oral insulin formulation is used to replace
pre-meal insulin injections in patients with diabetes. Addi-
tionally, insulin absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract
mimics endogenous insulin secretion. Endogenous insulin is
secreted by the pancreas into the portal circulation Insulin
absorbed following oral administration also goes directly to
the portal circulation. Thus, the oral route of insulin admin-
istration delivers insulin to its site of action in the liver,

oiferlng the potential to control glucose levels while limiting
systemic exposure to insulin. Oral insulin delivery using a
combination of insulin and the diacid form of FDKP is

hindered by the poor solubility of the FDKP diacid in the
low pH environment of the gastrointestinal tract. The FDKP
salts, however, rovide a local buffering eﬁect that facilitates
their dissolution in low pH.

Example 2. Preparation C of FDKP Di-Sodium
Salt

[0126] Fifty grams of fumaryl diketopiperazine (FDKP,
221.01 mmol, equiv), water (200 mL), and 10 N sodium
hydroxide (219 mL, 437.61 rnmol, 1.98 equiv.) were
charged to a l-1iter, 4-neck, round bottom ﬂask equipped
with a reﬂux condenser, overhead stirrer, nitrogen inlet, and
thermometer. Tie mixture was heated to 50° C. to achieve
a yellow solution and ethanol (650 mL) was added over 15
minutes. When the addition was complete, the slurry was
held at 50° C. for 30-60 minutes. The reaction mixture was
vacuum ﬁlterec and the isolated solids were washed with
ethanol (150 m ) and acetone (150 mLx2) then dried in a
vacuum oven (50° C., 30 inches of mercury) overnight. No
further puriﬁcation was required. The salt was assayed for
moisture content (Karl Fischer) and sodium content (el-
emental analysis and titration). The yield of the salt was
from about 90% to about 95%.

[0068] In some embodiment, the drugs include biologi-
cally active agents that are to be released in the circulatory
system aﬁer transport from the gastrointestinal tract follow-
ing oral delivery. In other embodiments, the biologically
active agents are to be released in the circulatory system
following pulmonary or nasal delivery. In still other embodi-
ments, the biologically active agents are to be released in the
central nervous system following nasal delivery. Additional,
the drugs can be absorbed through mucosa] tissue such as
rectal, vaginal, and/or buccal tissue.

[0069] Some of these biological agents are unstable in
gastric acid, diﬁ'use slowly through gastrointestinal mem-
branes, are poorly soluble at physiological pH, and/or are
susceptible to enzymatic destruction in the gastrointestinal
tract. The biological agents are combined with the dike-
topiperazine salts to protect them in the gastrointestinal tract
prior to release in the blood stream. In a preferred embodi-
ment the diketopiperazines are not biologically active and do
not alter the pharmacologic properties of the therapeutic
agents.

[0070] To associate one or more dnigs with a DKP salt, the
drug and the DKP salt are preferably mixed in solution or
suspension and subsequently dried. Either component may
be present as solute or suspendate. In different embodiments
the mixture is spray dried or lyophilized.

[0071] Spray drying is a thermal processing method used
to form, load or dry particulate solids from a variety of
solutions or suspensions. The use of spray drying for the
formation of dry particulate pharmaceuticals is known in the
art however in the past its use had been limited by its
incompatibility with biological macromolecular drugs,
including protein, peptides and nucleic acids due to the
nature of the spray drying process. During spray drying, a
solution or suspension is formed into droplets through
aerosolization and then passed through a heated gas stream
having suﬁicient heat energy to evaporate water and solvents
in the particles to a desired level before the particles are
collected. The inlet temperature is the temperature of the gas
stream leaving its source and its level is selected based upon
the lability of the macromolecule being treated. The outlet
temperature is a function of the inlet temperature, the heat
load required to dry the product along with other factors.

[0072] The present inventors have unexpectedly deter-
mined that the particles of the present invention, have
aerodynamic performance which improves with increasing
content of a biologically active agent which has not been
seen with other particles The respirable fraction (% rf), the
percentage of particles between 0.5 and 5.8 microns in
diameter, of the spray dried particles of the present invention
increases with increasing insulin content, rather than
decreasing as was expected. Therefore using the methods of
the present invention, diketopiperazine microparticles can
be formed which have higher biologically active agent
content that was previously achievable.

[0073] Additionally, the present inventors have surpris-
ingly determined that spray dried FDKP disodium salt/
insulin compositions have increased insulin stability as the
concentration of the FDKP disodium salt in the starting
solution increases. Stability was measured by insulin loss
aﬁer 17 days at 40° C./75% relative humidity. For example,
8.5% insulin was lost from powder spray dried from a
solution containing 37 mg/mL solids (total weight of FDKP
disodium salt/insulin). By comparison, 4.5% insulin was lost
from powder spray dried from a solution containing 45

Jan. 3], 2019

mg/mL solids and 2.7% insulin was lost from powder spray
dried from a solution containing 67 mg/mL solids.

[0074] In a further observation, inlet temperature was
found to have surprising effects on insulin stability. The data
indicate that insulin stability in the powder increases with
increasing inlet temperature as measured by insulin loss
aﬁer 17 days at 40°/75% RH. For example, about 4% insulin
was lost from powder spray dried at an inlet temperature of
180° C. By comparison, <1% insulin was lost from powder
spray dried at an inlet temperature of 200° C.

[0075] In an embodiment of the present invention,
microparticles suitable for delivery to the pulmonary system
are provided wherein the microparticles have a rugosity of
less than 2. Another aspect of the present invention inﬂu-
enced by spray drying is the particle morphology, measured
by rugosity, which the ratio of the speciﬁc area and the
surface area calculated from the particle size distribution and
particle density. The drying operation may be controlled to
provide dried particles having particular characteristics,
such as rugosity. Rugosity of spray dried particles is a
measure of the morphology of the surface of the particles,
such as the degree of folding or convolution.

[0076] It had previously been thought that a rugosity
above 2 was needed in order to obtain particles with suffi-
cient dispersability to form a free-ﬂowing powder. Surpris-
ingly, the present inventors have produced particles suitable
for pulmonary delivery with a rugosity below 2

[0077] The microparticle formulations of the present
invention can be administered as a liquid or solid form.
These can include solutions, suspensions, dry powders,
tablets, capsules, suppositories, patches for transdemial
delivery, and the like. These dilferent forms offer distinct,
but overlapping, advantages. The solid forms provide con-
venient bulk transport of drugs and can improve their
stability. They can also be formed into microparticles
enabling administration by inhalation speciﬁcally to the
nasal mucosa or deep lung, depending on the size of the
microparticle. Diketopiperazines can also facilitate absorp-
tion of the associated drug even when delivered as a solu-
tion. Some of the DKP salts (for example, the sodium and
potassium salts) offer improved solubility at neutral and
acidic pH as compared to the free acid, which can lead to
improved absorption in the stomach of orally administered
solid forms.

[0078] Dikeopiperazine salt counter cations may be
selected to produce salts having varying solubilities. These
varying solubilities can be the result of dilferences in dis-
solution rate and/or intrinsic solubility. By controlling the
rate of DKP salt dissolution, the rate of drug absorption from
the DKP salt/drug combination can also be controlled to
provide formulations having immediate and/or sustained
release proﬁles. For example, sodium salts of organic com-
pounds are characteristically highly soluble in biological
systems, while calcium salts are characteristically only
slightly soluble in biological systems. Thus, a formulation
comprised of a DKP sodium salt/drug combination would
provide immediate drug absorption, while a formulation
comprised of a DKP calcium salt/drug combination would
provide slower drug absorption. A formulation containing a
combination of both of the latter formulations could be used
to provide immediate drug absorption followed by a period
of sustained absorption.

[0079] Diketopiperazine salt formulations of biologically
active agents may be administered orally. Microparticles,
US 2019/0030133 A1

depending on the chemical nature and size, are absorbed
through the epithelial lining of the gastrointestinal tract into
the bloodstream or lymphatic system. Alternatively, the
composition can be administered as a solution in which the
DKP salt serves to facilitate the absorption of the drug:
Additionally, the microparticles can be administered as a
suspension or a solid dosage form that dissolves completely
and is absorbed following dissolution

[0080] For parenteral administration, microparticles of
less than ﬁve microns readily pass through a needle for
intravenous administration Suitable pharmaceutical carri-
ers, for example, phosphate buffered saline, are known and
commercially available: Similarly, microparticles can be
injected or implanted subcutaneously, intramuscularly, or
intraperitoneally. Additionally, the microparticles can be
placed in an implantable device to facilitate sustained and/or
controlled delivery.

[008]] For topical or transdennal administration,
microparticles can be suspended in a suim le pharmaceuti-
cal carrier for administration using methods appropriate for
the carrier and site of administration: For example,
microparticles are administered to the eye in a b fered
saline solution, at a pH of approximatey 7.4, or in an
ointment such as mineral oil. The dosage will be dependent
on the compound to be released as well as tie rate of re ease.
The microparticles, or aggregations of microparticles into
ﬁlms. disks, or tablets, with incorporated compound can be
administered to the skin in an ointment, cream, or patch.
Suitable pharmaceutical carriers are known to those s illed
in the art and conunercially available. Mucosal administra-
tion, including buccal, vaginal, rectal, nasa administration is
also contemplated.
[0082] Pulmonary delivery can be very effectively accom-
plished using dry powders comprising the micropartic es of
the invention and can lead to rapid absorption into the
circulation (bloodstream). Dry powder inhalers are known in
the art and particularly suitable inha er systems are
described in US, patent application Ser. Nos. 09/62 ,092
and 10/655,153, both entitled “Unit Dose Capsules an: Dry
Powder Inhaler”, which are hereby incorporated by refer-
ence in their entirety. Information on pu monary delivery
using microparticles comprising diketopiperazine can be
found in US. Pat. No. 6,428,771 entitled “Method for )rug
Delivery to the Pulmonary System,” whicr is hereby incor-
porated by reference in its entirety. The following examples
are meant to illustrate one or more emaodiments o the
invention and are not meant to limit the invention to that
which is described below.

DEFINITION OF TERMS

[0041] Prior to setting forth the invention, it may be
helpful to provide an understanding of certain terms that will
be used hereinafter:

Formula 1

R2 Bro

01132 R.
[0056] In the compound of Formula 1 the ring atoms El
and E2 at positions 1 and 4 are either 0 or N. At least one
of the side-chains R1 and R2 located at positions 3 and 6
respectively contains a carboxylate group (i.e., OR). In one
embodiment of the present invention these carboxylate
groups are located along the side chains (R1 and/or R2) as
pendent groups, in another embodiment the carboxylate is

located intra-chain (an ester) and yet in another embodiment
the carboxylate groups are terminal.

[0057] General methods for the synthesis of diketopipera-
zines are known in the art and have been described in US,
Pat, Nos. 5,352,461, 5,503,852, and 6,331,318 which have
been cited and incorporated herein by reference above. In a
preferred embodiment of the invention the diketopiperazine
is a derivative of 3,6-di(4-aminobutyl)-2,5-diketopiperazine,
which may be formed by condensation of the amino acid
lysine. Exemplary derivatives include 3,6-di(succinyl»4-
aminobutyl)-(succinyl diketopiperazine or SDKP), 3,6-di
(maleyl-4-aminobutyl)-, 3,6-di(citraconyl-4-aminobutyl)-,
3,6-di(glutaryl-4-aminobutyl)-, 3,6-di(malonyl-4-aminobu-
tyl)-, 3,6-di(oxalyl-4-aminobutyl)-, and 3,6-di(fumaryl-4-
aminobutyl)-2,5-diketopiperazine (hereinafter fumaryl dike-
topiperazine or FDKP). Additionally, nonsymmetrical
derivatives of the aforementioned compounds are also con-
templated. However, it is speciﬁcally noted herein that the
lithium salts of 2,5-diaspartyl-3,6-diketopiperazine and 2,5-
diglutamyl-3,6-diketopiperazine are not considered within
the scope of the present invention and as such are hereby
speciﬁcally disclaimed. The free acids of these disclaimed
compounds are depicted below in Formula 2 and Formula 3
respectively.

[0058] For convenience, the compound of Formula 2 will
be referred to hereinafter as 2,5-diaspartyl-3,6-diketopipera-
zine. The compound of Formula 3 will be referred to
hereinafter as 2,5-diglutamyl-3,6-diketopiperazine. It is

understood that all other heterocyclic compounds based on
Formula 1 are considered within the scope of the present
invention.

[0059] For exemplary purposes, diketopiperazines salts
and their derivatives will be described in detail. These
compounds are the preferred embodiments of the present
invention. However, this does not exclude other heterocyclic
compounds based on the compound of Formula 1.

[0060] The use of DKP salts for the delivery of phosphodi-
esterase type 5-inhibitors is described in co—pending US.
patent application Ser. No. 11/210,709 ﬁled Aug. 23, 2005
and entitled “Pulmonary Delivery of Inhibitors of Phos-
phodiesterase Type 5” and known to all by US. Provisional
Patent Application No. 60/603,764, which is hereby incor-
porated by reference in its entirety. Pulmonary drug delivery
using DKP microparticles is disclosed in Us. Pat. No.
6,428,771 entitled “Method For Drug Delivery To The
Pulmonary System”, which is hereby incorporated by ref-
erence in its entirety.

[0061] Diketopiperazine facilitate transcellular transport
of biologically active agents across biological tissues how-
ever they are not penetration enhancers. Penetration enhanc-
ers are compounds that improve drug movement across
biological tissues by disrupting cell membranes, Examples
of penetration enhancers are surfactants and soaps. Dike-
topiperazines do not disrupt cell membranes either in vitro
or in vivo. In vitro studies demonstrate that FDKP does not
disrupt cell membranes or tight junctions and does not
compromise cell viability. Diketopiperazine/insulin powder
compositions are soluble at the physiological pH of the lung
surface and dissolve rapidly after inhalation. Once dis-
solved, the DKP facilitates passive transcellular transport of
the insulin.

[0062] Applicants have discovered improved diketopip-
erazine compositions having greater solubility at a neutral
and/or acidic pH. Applicants have also discovered that
therapeutic complexes between improved diketopiperazines
and drug(s) of interest can be formed

[0063] The salts of the present invention can be prepared
by reacting the diketopiperazine free acid with a solution of
an appropriate base as described in Examples 1 and 2 below.
In a preferred embodiment, the salt is a pharmaceutica ly
acceptable salt such as the sodium (Na), potassium (K,
lithium (Li), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), ammonium, or
mono-, di- or tri-alkylammonium (as derived from triethyl-
amine, butylamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, or
pyridines, and the like) salts of diketopiperazine, or
example. The salt may be a mono-, di-, or mixed salt, Higher
order salts are also contemplated for diketopiperazines in
which the R groups contain more than one acid group. In
other aspects of the invention, a basic form of the agent may
be mixed with the DKP in order to form a drug salt of tie
DKP, such that the drug is the counter cation of the DKP.
[0064] For drug delivery, biologically active agents or
drugs having therapeutic, prophylactic, or diagnostic activi-
ties can be delivered using diketopiperazines. Essential y,
the biologically active agent is associated with the dik -
topiperazine particles of the present invention. As used
herein, “associated" means a biologically active agent-dike-
topiperazine composition formed by, among other methoc s,
co-precipitation, spray drying or binding (complexation) of
the diketopiperazine with the biologically active agent. Tie
resulting diketopiperazine particles include those that have
entrapped, encapsulated and/or been coated with the bio-

 

Jan. 31, 2019

logically active agent. While the exact mechanism of asso-
ciation has not been conclusively identiﬁed, it is believed
that the association is a function of physical entrapment
(molecular entanglement) in addition to electrostatic attrac-
tion including hydrogen bonding, van der Waal’s forces and
adsorption.

[0065] The biologically active agents that can be associ-
ated with the diketopiperazine particles of the present inven-
tion include, but are not limited to, organic or inorganic
compounds, proteins, or a wide variety of other compounds,
including nutritional agents such as vitamins, minerals,
amino acids, carbohydrates, sugars, and fats. In preferred
embodiments, the drugs include biologically active agents
that are to be released in the circulatory system after
transport from the GI tract following oral delivery. In other
preferred embodiments the materials are biologically active
agents that are to be released in the circulatory system
following pulmonary or nasal delivery, In other preferred
embodiments the materials are biologically active agents
that are to be release in the central nervous system following
nasal delivery. Additionally, the drug can be absorbed
through mucosal tissue such as rectal, vaginal, and/or buccal
tissue. Non-limiting examples of biologically active agents
include proteins and peptides (wherein protein is deﬁned as
consisting of 100 amino acid residues or more and a peptide
is less than 100 amino acid residues), such as insulin and
other hormones, polysaccharides, such as heparin, nucleic
acids (such as plasmids, oligonucleotides, antisense, or
siRNA), lipids and lipopolysaccharides, and organic mol-
ecules having biological activity such as many of the anti-
biotics, anti-inﬂammatories, vasoactive agents (including
agents used to treat erectile dysfunction) and neuroactive
agents, Speciﬁc non-limiting examples include steroids,
hormones, decongestants, anticoagulants, immunomodulat-
ing agents, cytotoxic agents, antibiotics, antivirals, anesthet-
ics, sedatives, antidepressants, cannabinoids, anticoagulants,
antisense agents, antigens, and antibodies. In some
instances, the proteins may be antibodies or antigens which
otherwise would have to be administered by injection to
elicit an appropriate response. More particularly. com-
pounds that can be associated with the diketopiperazine
compositions of the present invention include insulin, hepa-
rins, calcitonin, felbamate, parathyroid hormone and frag-
ments thereof, growth hormone, erythropoietin, glucagon-
like peptide-1, somatotrophin-releasing hormone, follicle
stimulating hormone, cromolyn, adiponectin, RNAse, ghre-
lin, zidovudine, didanosine, tetrahydrocannabinol (i.e., can-
nabinoids), atropine, granulocytes colony stimulating factor,
lamotrigine, chorionic gonadotropin releasing factor,
luteinizing releasing hormone, beta-galactosidase and Arga-
troban, Compounds with a wide range of molecular weight
can be associated, for example, between 100 and 500.000
grams per mole.

[0066] Imaging agents including metals, radioactive iso-
topes, radiopaque agents, and radiolucent agents, can also be
incorporated into diketopiperazine delivery systems. Radio-
isotopes and radiopaque agents include gallium, technetium,
indium, strontium, iodine, barium, and phosphorus,

[0067] Additionally the drugs can be in various forms,
such as uncharged molecules, metal or organic salts, or
prodrugs. For acidic drugs, metal salts, amines or organic
cations (e.g., quatemary ammonium) can in some cases be
used.

females also resulted in markedly enhanced survival (FIG.
10e). Southern blotting of the tumors that developed in
RANKAM’" females conﬁrmed eﬁicient deletion of RANK
(FIG. 100). A11 tumors that developed in control and
RANKAma'" females exhibited typical histopathology of
E-Cadherin expressing ductal adenocarcinomas of the
Cytokeratine (CK) 5 and CKI4 positive basal cell subtype
(FIG. 20, FIG. 110,17). However, duc'tal adenocarcinomas
arising in RANKA'M'” females frequently developed exten-
sive areas of squamous metaplasia (FIG. 20, FIG. 11a,b). In
line with these histopathological changes, gene expression
proﬁling of mammary carcinomas from control and
RANKAM'" females showed distinctive differences in their

molecular signatures as assessed by gene clustering.

Example 17: Cancer Onset aﬁer Progestin
Challenge and DNA Damage

[0131] Since RANKAma'" showed a delayed onset in pro-
gestin-induced mammary cancer, next the incidence of
mammary tumors at early stages aﬁer MFA/DMBA chal-
lenge was analysed. One week after the last DMBA treat-
ment, all RANK expressing control females already exhib-
ited multiple in situ carcinomas and even invasive mammary
tumors. By contrast, very few carcinomas were observed in
situ and never any invasive mammary carcinomas in
RANKAma'" animals one week after the last DMBA chal-
lenge (FIG. 2d). Three weeks after the last DMBA challenge
the incidence of carcinomas in situ was similar among
control and RANKAW’" females, but invasive carcinomas
were still very infrequent in the RANKAm’" females (FIG.
2e). Moreover, proliferation was typically reduced in tumors
from RANKAma'" females (FIG. 2a', e). Deletion ofRANK in
multiple other tissues including the liver, heart, muscle and
the haematopoietic compartment, but not in mammary epi-
thelial cells, using Mx-Cre rank/70W” mice did not delay the
onset of MPA/DMBA-induced mammary cancer (FIG. 12a-
c), suggesting that the effects of RANK/RANKL impaimrent
are restricted to mammary epithelial cells. Moreover, mam-
mary gland speciﬁc deletion of RANK did not alter mam-
mary cancer incidence (FIG. 12d,e) or the histopathology of
adenocarcinomas (FIG. 13a-c) in MMTV-NeuT transgenic
mice, a genetic model of mammary cancer. In these NeuT
tumors very low levels of RANKL were observed (FIG.
13d,e). Thus, genetic inactivation of RANK in mammary
epithelial cells results in a markedly delayed onset and
reduced incidence of progestin-driven mammary cancer.

Example 18: RANKL Signaling

[0132] RANKL-RANK signaling via IKKu-NFKB-Cy-
clinDl in mammary epithelial cells is illustrated in FIG. 14a.
RANKL stimulation indeed resulted in p65 N'FKB and IKBu
phosphorylation in primary mouse mammary gland epithe-
lial cells (MECs) (FIG. 3a). In addition, RANKL stimulation
of MECs triggered phosphorylation of p38-MAPKs and
ERK (FIG. 1417). To directly show whether RANK mediates
NFKB-CyclinDl activation downstream of progestins in
vivo, mice were challenged with MPA. A three day MPA
treatment resulted in nuclear accumulation of phosphory-
lated IKBoL, indicative of an active NFKB pathway, and
induction of CyclinDl protein expression in mammary
epithelial cells, both of which were severely reduced in
RANKA'W'" female (FIG. 15a,b). Moreover, in MPA/
DMBA-induced mammary adenocarcinomas isolated from

Jan. 31, 2019

control and RANKAM'” females we found impaired activa-
tion of the NFKB pathway (FIG. 3b) and downregulated
mRNA expression of Cyclin D] (F IG. 30). In these primary
tumors also upregulation of p21 mRNA (FIG. 3c) was
observed, a gene that is transcriptionally suppressed by the
Id2 pathway”. The Id2 pathway is a second genetically
conﬁrmed downstream pathway for RANKL/RANK in
mammary epithelial cells”. To extend these ﬁndings to
human, human SKBR3 breast tumor cells were assayed.
RANKL stimulation induced NFKB, p38-MAPKs and ERK
activation and proliferation in SKBR3 cells (FIG. 1611,17). To
further test the effects of RANKL stimulation the ability of
these cells to grow in an anchorage-independent manner Was
assessed, which correlates well with tumorigenicity in
vivolg. Importantly, similar to EGFR stimulation, it Was
observed that RANKL induced growth of SKBR3 cells in
soft agar (FIG. 34!), i.e. RANK signaling not only triggers
proliferation but also acts as a transforming agent to induce
anchorage-independent growth.

[0133] In osteoclasts, besides the NFKB pathway, the
calcineurin-NFATcI signaling pathway has been found to be
essential for RANKL-RANK mediated osteoclastogenesis.
NFATcl can also be regulated by the Id2 pathway during
RANKL-mediated osteoclastogenesis. To assess whether
these key RANKL-RANK activation pathways are also
operational in MPA/DMBA-induced mammary cancer,
MMTV—Cre nfatclﬂaX/A (NFATclAW'm) and MMTV—Cre
Ikkotﬂmﬂw‘ (IKKotAmm) mice were generated to delete
NFATcl and IKKot in mammary epithelial cells. Both
mutant mouse strains appear healthy and exhibit no overt
defects in any organs assayed. When challenged with MPA/
DMBA, IKKaAM'" mice exhibited a delayed onset of mam-
mary cancer (FIG. 3e). In trunors from IKKaAm’” mice
normal expression of IKKﬁ and IKKY was found but
reduced NFKB activation as determined by increased IKB
protein levels and decreased p65 NFKB phosphorylation
(FIG. 3b) and downregulated mRNA expression of the
NFKB target gene Cyclin D1 (FIG. 30) suggesting that IKKoL
is indeed required for NFKB signaling in these tumors. As
expected, the Id2 pathway gene p21 was not affected in
tumors from IK<0LA"‘“"‘ mice (FIG. 3c). No signiﬁcant
differences in the tumor onset between control and
NFATclAm'" mice were observed (FIG. 1612,51), suggesting
that downstream signaling requirements are different in
osteoclast progenitors and mammary gland epithelial cells.
Thus, deletion of KKa, but not NFATcl, in mammary gland
epithelial cells affects the onset of progestin-driven mam-
mary cancer.

Example 19: {ormone Driven Cancer Development
Due to DNA Damage

[0134] Althougi MPA treatment induces very rapid and
massive proliferation of mammary epithelial cells, MPA
alone is not sufﬁcient to trigger mammary cancer which
requires a carcinogen to induce DNA mutations. To analyze
the role of RANKL in the cellular response to DNA damage
such as cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, mouse primary
mammary epithe ial cells (MECs) and the RANKL-respon-
sive human breast cancer cell line SKBR3 were treated with
DNA damaging agents doxorubicin or y-irradiation.
RANKL treatment did not alter induction of yHZAX and p53
or activation of Chkl, prototypic markers of a functional
DNA damage response (FIG. 17a). Moreover, RANKL did
not alter the early cell cycle arrest after DNA damage with

Example 13: Effects of Progestin on RANKL
Levels

[0126] MPA (medroxyprogesterone acetate, a representa-
tive progestin) pellets were implanted into female mice and
RANKL expression was assayed. MPA treatment resulted in
a more than 2000 fold induction of RANKL mRNA in
isolated mammary epithelial cells (FIG. la), mRNA expres-
sion of RANK, of the decoy receptor of RANKL osteopro-
gesterin (OPG), of PTHrP (known to induce RANKL) and
of TRAIL (known to bind to OPG) were not changed in
isolated mammary epithelial cells. Immunohistochemistry
conﬁrmed induction of RANKL protein in the mammary
gland (FIG, 117), Western blotting of isolated mammary
epithelial cells also showed induction of the 19 kDa soluble
form of RANKL (FIG. 5a), most likely due to alternative
splicing (FIG. 517-01) as well as induction of MMP14 and
ADAM17/TACE (FIG. 5e), two proteases known to shed
RANKL from the cell surface. RANKL induction in
response to MFA in in vitro cell culture assays was not
observed (FIG, 6a-c) suggesting that progestins per se are
not sufﬁcient to induce RANKL expression. Since MPA can
induce transcription of prolactin and the prolactin receptor in
breast cancer cells and prolactin can directly induce RANKL
via Jak2/Stat5 signaling, it was tested whether MPA induces
RANKL in the mammary gland of prolactin receptor knock-
out mice, Whereas MPA triggers substantial production of
RANKL protein in female control mice, we failed to detect
RANKL induction in prolactin receptor mutants (FIG. lc).
This data indicates that MPA triggers massive RANKL
expression in the mammary gland via the prolactin receptor
and/or that prolactin and MPA cooperate in RANKL induc-
tion.

Example 14: Effects of Progestins on RANKL
Levels in RANKL/RANK Impaired Mice

[0127] To examine the potential role of RANKL/RANK in
MFA-mediated tumorigenesis RANK was deleted in mam-
mary epithelial cells using KS-Cre and MMTV-Cre medi-
ated excision of an inducible RANK allele (KS-Cre rank/b"
A mice and MMTV—Cre rankﬂmA mice). Both mouse lines
appear healthy and exhibit normal bone structures and
lymph node formation, As expected KS-Crc rank/q”A mice
exhibited apparently normal mammary gland development
in puberty; however, these mice did not develop milk-
secreting lobulo-alveolar structures during pregnancy (FIG.
7a,b). These etfects were cell autonomous using transplan-
tation experiments (FIG. 70). In MMTV—Cre rankﬂ‘m/A mice,
mammary gland development in nulliparous females and
formation of milk-secreting lobuloalveolar structures in
pregnancy appeared normal (FIG. 8a-c). To exclude any
issue of development eﬁects in KS-Cre rank/b)"A mice that
might affect certain cell populations in normal physiology,
MMTV—Cre rank/’0’“ mice were therefore used for all
further experiments. These MMTV—Cre rank/q”A mutant
mice are hereafter termed RANKAM'”,

Example 15: Mechanism of RANKL Activation
Upon Progestin Administration

[0128] In a wild type population MPA treatment triggers
massive proliferation of mammary epithelial cells. MPA-
induccd proliferation of mammary epithelial cells was sig-
niﬁcantly reduced in RANKA'M'" females (FIG. 1d; FIG.
9a-c). Accordingly. RANKL i.p. injections into nulliparous
females triggered proliferation of mammary gland epithelial
cells via RANK (FIG. 9d,e). Recently it has been reported
that endogenous progesterone affects the numbers of Lin-
CD24+CD49f’“ stem cells during pregnancy15 and the
estrous cycle“. In both studies, the RANKL/RANK system
was implicated based on in vivo whole body Ab blocking
studies and RT-PCR expression, however, it was not known
whether this is a direct effect of RANKL-RANK in mam-
mary epithelial cells rather than a secondary elfect. There-
fore it was assayed whether progestins such as MPA can also
expand Lin-CD24+CD491”" cells, MPA treatment resulted in
a two-fold expansion of Lin-CD24+CD491"x cells. Such
expansion did not occur in MFA-treated RANKAM'"
females (FIG. lej). These data provide the ﬁrst genetic
proof that the RANKL/RANK system controls expansion of
Lin-CD24+CD491"i cells.

Million Women Study, the use of progestins has been
epidemiologically linked to the onset and incidence of breast
cancer. Progestin-driven mammary cancer can be modeled
in female mice, where implantation of slow release MPA
pellets in the presence of the DNA damaging agent dimeth-
ylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA) triggers mammary cancer
(FIG. 2a; FIG. 10a,[7).

[0130] In control females, MPA/DMBA treatment induced
a rapid onset of palpable mammary tumors. Intriguingly, in
RANKAM'" female mice, a marked delay in the onset of
MPA/DMBA-induced mammary cancer was observed (FIG.
2b; FIG. 10c,a'). Delayed tumor onset on RANKA’M’”

tive methodology for suppression of speciﬁc gene function
in eukaryotic cells. When applied to cells and organisms,
RNAi entails the degradation of target mRNA upon trans-
fection of short interfering RNA (siRNA) oligos or short-
hairpin RNA (shRNA) encoding vectors. Various methods
of RNAi have been described and are generally known for
the altering gene expression in plant cells, drosophila and
human melanoma cells as is described for example in US
2002/0162126 and US 2002/0173478. The siRNA for use in
the methods and compositions of the invention are selected
to target a desired molecule of the RANKL signaling path-
way or combinations of such molecules. In this manner they
are targeted to various RNAs corresponding to a target gene.
It is understood by one of skill in the art that the siRNA as
herein described may also include altered siRNA that is a
hybrid DNA/RNA construct or any equivalent thereof,
double-stranded RNA, microRNA (miRNA), as well as
siRNA forms such as siRNA duplications, small hairpin
RNA (shRNA) in viral and non-viral vectors and siRNA or
shRNA in carriers. RANKL RNAi is eg. described in WO
2005/028633.

[0045] There exists several methods in the art for inhib-
iting gene expression using RNAi such as described for
example in W0 02/055692, WO 02/055693, EP 1 144 623
B1 and WO 03/074654. By using a siRNA therapy any
cellular factor can be targeted and inhibited for the inventive
RANKL antagonizing and inhibiting therapy. Therefore, any
such compound can be used as a RANKL inhibitor

[0046] In preferred embodiments the RANKL inhibitor is
a RANKL or RANK ligand, preferably an anti-RANKL
antibody, such as Denosumab, or as disclosed in US 2008/
107597. “Anti-RANKL-antibody” includes any functional
equivalents and derivatives thereof, including antibody frag-
ments such as Fab, F(ab)2, Fv, or single chain antibodies
(scAb). Antibodies speciﬁcally binding the RANKL activity
associated proteins and factors, especially RANKL and
RANK and any proteins in the RANKL signalling pathway,
are also encompassed by the invention. The antibodies may
be produced by immunization with full-length protein,
soluble forms of the protein, or a fragment thereof The
antibodies of the invention may be polyclonal or monoclo-
nal, or may be recombinant antibodies, such as chimeric
antibodies wherein the murine constant regions on light and
heavy chains are replaced by human sequences, or CDR-
grafted antibodies wherein only the complementary deter-
mining regions are of murine origin. Antibodies of the
invention may also be human antibodies prepared, for
example, by immunization of transgenic animals capable of
producing human antibodies (W0 93/ l 2227). The antibod-
ies are useful for detecting RANKL in biological samples,
thereby allowing the identiﬁcation of cells or tissues which
produce the protein in addition, antibodies which bind to
RANKL (and block interaction with other binding com-
pounds) have therapeutic use as RANKL inhibitor.

[0047] RANKL inhibitors may be suitable and used for
reducing the free RANKL concentration in the circulation of
a patient. RANK is not the only natural receptor for
RANKL. Osteoprotegin (OPG) is a secreted decoy receptor
that can reduce the RANKL activity (binding of RANKL to
RANK and its signaling pathway via IKKoL, IKBoL,
PiNFKB and cyclinDl or via Id2-p2l, MAPK Erk and
p38). Therefore OPG may be administered as RANKL
inhibitor. Furthermore RANK or a soluble form thereof

Jan. 31, 2019

itself may be used as RANKL ligand and inhibitor to reduce
the free serum concentration of RANKL.

[0048] The inhibitor is usually administered in a therapeu-
tically effective amount, an amount that reduces RANKL
activity to signiﬁcantly decrease cancer cell viability. In
particular embodiments the RANKL activity may be sup-
pressed to normal levels of an average person, furthermore,
the RANKL activity may be reduced below average levels.
Preferably the RANKL activity is reduced by at least 25%,
by at least 30%, by at least 40%, by at least 50%, by at least
60%, by at least 70% by at least 80% or by at least 90%. In
preferred embodiments this reduction equates to RANKL
serum levels

[0049] The inhibitor may be used in combination with or
for priming a further anti-cancer therapy, preferably a radia-
tion- or chemotherapy. According to this aspect of the
present invention a method for increasing the eﬂicacy of
cancer therapy in a subject is provided, comprising admin-
istering to a subject in need of an effective amount of an
RANKL inhibitor, wherein said subject is also being admin-
istered a cancer therapy selected from the group consisting
of small-molecule drugs, angiogenesis inhibitors, tumor
vaccine, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiation therapy,
gene therapy and combinations thereof.

[0050] RANKL acts as a protective agent, immunizing
cancer cells against DNA damage associated cell death By
reducing RANKL activity and therefore reducing RANKLs
protective elfect on cancer, the cells become more suscep-
tible to DNA damage. Therefore, in a preferred embodiment
a cancer is treated in addition with a RANKL inhibitor and
a further anti-cancer therapy that induces further cell dam-
age such as radiation or chemotherapies. Preferably such
further cancer therapies are speciﬁc for cancer in a certain
tissue, like breast, e.g. by administering localised a chemo-
therapeutic agent or a homing agent that targets the tissue
cancer cells and induces further DNA damage either by
radiation or a chemotherapeutic agent.

[0051] According to this embodiment the present inven-
tion relates also to a kit comprising a chemotherapeutic
agent and a RANKL inhibitor.

[0052] According to a further embodiment, a RANKL
inhibitor is provided for use in combination with a hormone
replacement therapy or for use in combination with a
hormone contraceptive, in particular to reduce the risk of
developing breast cancer.

[0053] The patient is preferably a mammal, in particular
preferred a primate, even more preferred a human, in par-
ticular a female. The patient might have or might have had
a therapy with hormones, in particular female sexual hor-
mones. Such a past therapy might have been in the past 5,
4, 3, 2, years or past 36, 32, 30, 28, 26, 24, 22, 20, 18, 16,
14, 12, 10, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1, month(s). Patients, in
particular females, receiving a hormone replacement therapy
or are taking a hormone contraceptive, in particular a
progesterone or a progestine are at an increased risk to
develop cancer. To reduce this increased risk, the present
invention provides the combined use of a RANKL inhibitor
as described above.

[0054] The present invention further provides a method of
reducing RANKL activity in a cancer patient comprising
administering a RANKL inhibitor to said patient.

[0055] In a further aspect the invention relates to a method
of reducing the amount of cancer cells in a patient compris-
ing administering a RANKL inhibitor to said patient.

crossed seven times onto a BALBc background before
generating the MMTV—Cre rankA/ﬂwe‘i mice. MMTV—NeuT
mice were kindly provided by Guido Fomi, Milan. MMTV-
Cre (stock #003553) and Mx-Crc mice (stock #003556)
were obtained from the Jackson Laboratory. K5-Cre,
IKKosﬂmd and NFATclﬂMM mice have been previously
described2'4. Mouse genotypes were determined by PCR
and Southern blot analysis: In all experiments, only litter-
mate mice from the same breedings were used. All mice
were bred and maintained according to institutional guide-
lines.

[0109] RANK Deletion in Tumors and Cre Effects,

[0110] Southern blotting of the tumors that developed in
RANKA'M'" females showed deletion of RANK, albeit some
residual wild type band was observed (FIG: 100) that may be
explained by the presence of other cell types and/or escaper
cells, Differences in tumor onset in Cre-negative control
females and litterrnates expressing the MMTV—Cre trans-
gene were not observed indicating that Cre expression per se
does not alter tumor incidence in the MFA/DMBA mam-
mary tumor model (FIG, 10d),

Example 2: MPA/DMBA-lnduced Mammary
Carcinogenesis

[0111] MFA/DMBA treatment was performed as
describeds’s. Brieﬂy, six-week old female mice were anes-
thetized with ketamine-xylazine and surgically implanted
with slow-release Medroxyprogesterone Acetat (MPA) pel-
lets (50 mg, 90-day release; hmovative Research of
America) subcutaneously on the right ﬂank. 200 pl DMBA
(5 mg/ml diluted in cottonseed oil) was administered by oral
gavage 6 times throughout the following 8 weeks as outlined
in FIG, 2a, Onset of mammary tumors was determined by
palpation. Ditferences in tumor onset in Cre-negative con-
trol females and littermates expressing the MMTV—Cre
transgene were not observed indicating that Cre expression
per sc does not alter tumor incidence in the MFA/DMBA
mammary tumor model.

Example 3: Mammary Tissue Transplants

[0112] For transplantation studies, mammary epithelial
tissue was isolated from nulliparous 3-week-old donors and
implanted into cleared mammary fat pads (devoid of endog-
enous epithelium) of 3-week-old host nu/nu mice as
described7. Three weeks aﬁer surgery, hosts were mated and
mannnary tissue was isolated for analysis.

Example 4: Histology, Whole-Mount, and
lmmunohistochemistry

[0113] For histological analysis. 5 pm sections were cut
and stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E). Whole-
mount staining of mammary glands was performed as
describedg. For irnmunoperoxidase staining paraffin-embed-
ded sections were dehydrated and antigenic epitopes
exposed using a 10 mM citrate buffer or microwaving.
Sections were incubated with antibodies to cytokeratine 5,
cytokeratine 14, E-cadherin, anti-Ki67 (Novocastra) and
anti-active Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling) and visualized using
peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies, Histomorpho-
metric indices (proliferation and apoptosis) were calculated
as the number of positive epithelial cells divided by the total
number of epithelial cells, with no fewer than 1000 nuclei

Jan. 31, 2019

for Ki67 stainings and no fewer than 5000 cells for active
Caspase 3 staining counted per section.

Example 5: Western Blotting

[0114] The human epithelial breast tumor cell line SKBR3
and primary non-transformed mouse mammary epithelial
cells were left untreated or stimulated with recombith
murine RANKme 9. Adenocarcinomas were isolated from
control and mutant mice and total protein lysates prepared.
Western blotting was carried out using standard protocols.
Brieﬂy, blots were blocked with 5% BSA in leBS 0.1%

Tween-20 (TBST) for 1 hour and incubated with primary
antibody overnight at 4° C, (diluted in TBST according to
the manufactures protocol), Primary antibodies reactive to

Example 7: DNA Damage Responses

[0116] For measurement of cell cycle arrest and apoptosis
primary mouse mammary epithelial cells and SKBR3
human breast cancer cells were seeded at a cell-density of
100000 cells/well in a 6-well plate and allowed to grow for
24 hours. Cells where then treated with doxorubicin (1 M)
or y-irradiation (2 Gray) in the absence or presence of
recombinant RANKL (1 ug/ml). Cell cycle arrest and num-
bers of dead cells were determined using propidium iodine
staining, To determine in vivo mammary gland epithelial
cell death, control and RANKA'M'” litterrnate females were
y-irradiated with a total dose of 5 Gray (Gy). Six hours later,
mammary glands were isolated and immunostained for
active Caspase 3 (Cell Signaling) indicative of apoptosis.

Example 8: FACS Analysis of Primary Mammary
Epithelial Cells

[0117] For FACS analysis of mammary epithelial sub-
populations the following protocol for tissue dissociation
was used to generate single cell suspensions: lymph nodes
were removed from both inguinal mammary fat pads and fat
pads were then digested in 2 ml complete EpiCult medium
(EpiCult—B basal medium (StemCell Technologies SCT
Catalog #05610) supplemented with EpiCult—B proliferation
supplements, 10 ng/ml bFGF (SCT Catalog #02634), 10
ng/ml EGF (SCT Catalog #02633), 4 [Lg/ml Heparin (SCT
Catalog #07980), 2.5 ml PBS (5%) and antibiotics) with
25x collagenase/hyaluronidase (eg. 500 pl 10x collage-
nase+1 .5 m1 Epicult per mouse) (SCT Catalog #07912) in 50
ml Falcon tubes at 37° C. for 2.5 hours. After vigorous
vortexing, pellets were washed with 10 mL HF medium
(Hanks Balanced Salt Solution Modiﬁed SCT Catalog
#07913+2% FBS) Pellets were then resuspended in 2 ml of
pre-wanned trypsin-EDTAr After another wash with 10 mL
HF, pellets were resuspend in 2 mL pre-warmed (37° C.)
dispase (SCT Catalog #07913) supplemented with 200 u] of
1 mymL DNAse I (SCT Catalog #07900). Aﬁer a ﬁnal wash

in HF, cells were counted and prepared for FACS staining.
One million cells were incubated with the following anti-
bodies: biotin-conjugated anti-CD31 (#553371; BD), which
labels endothelial cells, and biotinylated CD45* and Ter119+
(StemSep murine chimera cocktail #13058C; Stem Cell
Technologies; 315 [Ll/100 ul vol), which labels hematopoietic
cells, for 10 min at room temperature. Hematopoietic and
endothelial cells were excluded by FACS using Strepavidin-
conjugated-AFC (#554067; BD). Staining with anti-CD49f
(#551129; BD) and CD24 (#553261; BD) was used to
identify the mammary stem cell population as previously
describedm'”.

Example 9: Cancer Stem Cell Assays

[0118] Self-renewal of mammary cancer stem cells, i.e.
tumor initiating cells (Tle), was assayed using a marnmo-
sphere assay as described previouslys’”. Brieﬂy, similar
sized tumors (1 cm3 volume) were minced and digested in
complete EpiCult medium with 2.5x collagenase/hyaluroni-
dase (SCT Catalog #07912). 2><105 cells were then cultured
in serum-free EpiCult medium supplemented with B27
(lnvitrogen), 20 rig/ml EGF (Protech), and 20 ng/ml bFGF
(Sigma) using 6 well ultra-low attachment plates (Corning
Costar) The primary mammospheres, which formed over 7
days, were collected by gentle centrifugation (800 rpm),
digested into single cell suspensions with trypsin (0.05%, 10
min), and assayed for their ability to form secondary mam-
mospheres as above.

Example 10: Anchorage-Independent Growth

[0119] The ability of cells to grow in soﬁ agar was assayed
as described previously”. Brieﬂy, DNA grade agarose (1%
in DMEM) was used as bottom layer (2 ml in 6 well plates)
and 2x10“ SKBR3 cells were seeded in 1.5 ml agarose (0.3%
in DMEM). Cells were overlayed with 1.5 ml DMEM
supplemented with 10% F CS and cultured for 24 days.

Example 11: Progesterone Assay

[0120] 1" incubation: 30 [.LL sampleiin the presence of
a biotinylated monoclonal progesterone-speciﬁc anti-
body and a progesterone derivative labeled with ruthe-
nium complexiare incubated with Danazol to release
progesterone. Progesterone from the sample competes
with the labeled progesterone derivative for the anti-
body binding site

[0121] 2"d incubation: After addition of streptavidin-
coated microparticles, the complex becomes bound to
the solid phase via interaction of biotin and streptavi-
din. The amount of the labeled progesterone derivative
bound to the solid phase is inversely proportional to the
progesterone content of the sample.

[0122] The reaction mixture is aspirated into the mea-
suring cell where the microparticles are magnetically
captured onto the surface of the electrode. Unbound
substances are then removed with ProCell. Application
of a voltage to the electrode then induces chemilurni-
nescent emission which is measured by a photomulti-
plier,

[0123] Results are determined via a calibration curve
which is instrument-speciﬁcally generated by 2-point
calibration and a master curve provided via the reagent
barcode.

[0056] Furthermore the invention teaches a method of
increasing cell death due to DNA damage of a cell com-
prising inhibiting RANK or RANKL or IKK-alpha or IkB-
alpha, P-N'F-kappa-B or CyclinDl or Id2 or MAPK Erk or
p38 or increasing p21 or any combination thereof, in par-
ticular a combination with inhibiting RANKL, in said cell,
preferably by administering a RANKL inhibitor to said cell.
The cell receiving the inventive treatment may be a tissue
cell wherein hormone dependent cancers may develop,
especially the breast (especially for prophylactic methods)
or a cancer cell. Furthermore said cell can be an epithelial
cell or a cancer stem cell. Especially cancer of epithelial
origin can be effectively treated by the inventive methods. In
particular preferred embodiments the cancer is of mammary
gland epithelial cells Furthermore RANKL inhibition as a
signiﬁcant effect on cancer stern cells and can prevent or
reduce cancer comprising such stem cells.

[0057] According to preferred therapeutic or preventive
methods characterized in that the patient has received a
hormone treatment, preferably a hormone replacement
therapy, preferably with progesterone or a progestin, or a
hormone contraceptive, such as described above.

[0058] As mentioned above, hormone treatment, in par-
ticular with female sexual hormones increases the risk of
breast cancer and therefore, in a inventive therapeutical
preventive method preferably the patient has been treated
with such a hormone therapy previously or during the
inventive therapeutic method. Previous administrations of
hormones may have been in the past 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 years or
more.

[0059] In a further aspect the present invention provides a
pharmaceutical composition comprising a RANKL inhibitor
and a hormone or derivative thereof, selected from proges-
terone or a progestin, or a hormone contraceptive.

[0060] As mentioned, RANKL inhibition can reduce the
risk of developing cancer by female sexual hormones, in
particular of estrogene, progesterone or progestinsi There-
fore, it is advised to administer such homiones together with
the RANKL inhibitor provided by the present invention.
Such hormones might be used for hormone replacement
therapies or as hormonal contraceptives.

[0061] Most common types of hormonal contraceptive
formulations include both an estrogen and a progestin, or are
progestogen-only formulations which contain only proges-
terone or one of its synthetic analogues (progestins). In order
to reduce the risk of hormone dependent cancer develop-
ment, the present invention provides a combined use of
hormone therapeutics, including female sexual hormone
contraceptives, together with a RANKL inhibitor.

[0062] Pharmaceutical compositions or formulations for
therapeutic or prophylactic use may comprise a pharmaceu-
tically acceptable diluent, carrier, solubilizer, emulsiﬁer,
preservative and/or adjuvant. The invention also provides
for pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeuti-
cally effective amount of an RANKL inhibitori The term
“therapeutically effective amount” means an amount which
provides a therapeutic effect for a speciﬁed condition and
route of administration. The composition may be in a liquid
or lyophilized form and comprises a diluent (Tris, acetate or
phosphate buifers) having various pH values and ionic
strengths, solubilizer such as Tween or Polysorbate, carriers
such as human serum albumin or gelatin, preservatives such
as thimerosal or benzyl alcohol, and antioxidants such as
ascrobic acid or sodium metabisulﬁte. Selection of a par-

Jan. 3], 2019

ticular composition will depend upon a number of factors,
including the condition being treated, the route of adminis-
tration and the pharmacokinetic parameters desired. siRNA
formulations are preferably administered in liposome for-
mulations.

[0063] The present invention also relates to a kit compris-
ing a iormone therapeutic, as described above, and a
RANKn inhibitor. Such a kit may allow separate adminis-
tration of the hormone therapeutic and the RANKL inhibitor.
[0064] Also encompassed are compositions comprising
RANKi inhibitors modiﬁed with water soluble polymers to
increase solubility, stability, plasma half-life and bioavail-
ability. Compositions may also comprise incorporation of
RANK_. inhibitors into liposomes, microemulsions,
micelles or vesicles for controlled delivery over an extended
period of time. Soluble RANKL inhibitors may be formu-
lated into microparticles suitable for pulmonary administra-
tion.

[0065] Compositions of the invention may be adminis-
tered by injection, either subcutaneous, intravenous or intra-
muscular, or by oral, nasal, pulmonary or rectal administra-
tion. The route of administration eventually chosen will
depend upon a number of factors and may be ascertained by
one skilled in the art.

[0066] The invention also provides for pharmaceutical
compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount
of the anti-RANKL inhibitory nucleic acids (siRNA) of the
invention together with a pharmaceutically acceptable adju-
vant. Nucleic acid compositions will be suitable for the
delivery ofpart or all ofthe coding region of RANKL or any
protein in the RANKL signalling pathway as described
above and/or ﬂanking regions to cells and tissues as part of
an anti-sense therapy regimen.

In preferred embodiments the present invention is deﬁned as
follows:

1. Method of treating or preventing cancer in a subject
comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount
of a RANKL inhibitor to said patient.

2. Method of increasing cancer cell apoptosis comprising
administering a RANKL inhibitor to said cancer cell.

3. Method according to deﬁnition I, wherein the cancer is
breast cancer or prostate cancer or according to deﬁnition 2
wherein the cancer cell is a breast cancer cell or a prostate
cancer cell.

4. Method of any one of deﬁnitions 1 to 3, wherein the
cancer comprises cancer cells with sexual hormone recep-
tors, preferably progesterone or estrogene receptors.

5. Method of deﬁnition 1 to 4, wherein the cancer is a
primary cancer or the cancer cell is a cell of a primary
cancer.

6. A RANKL inhibitor for use in the treatment or prevention
of hormone dependent cancer in a patient, preferably
wherein the cancer comprises cancer cells with sexual
hormone receptors, preferably progesterone or estrogene
receptors.

7 Inhibitor of deﬁnition 6, wherein the patient has received
a hormone treatment, preferably a hormone replacement
therapy, preferably with progesterone or a progestin, or a
hormone contraceptive

8. Inhibitor according to deﬁnition 6 or 7, characterized in
that the cancer is breast, mammary or prostate cancer.

9. Inhibitor according to any one of deﬁnitions 6 to 8,
characterized in that the cancer is of epithelial cell origin.

[0017] Receptor Activator of NF-KB Ligand (RANKL,
also known as ODF, TRANCE, OPGL, TNFSFll) and its
receptor RANK (TRANCE-R, TNFRSFIIA) are essential
for the development and activation of osteoclasts. RANKL
inhibition was approved for potentially millions of patients
to prevent bone loss. RANK and RANKL have been cloned
and characterized (US, Pat. No. 6,017,729, EP 0 873 998,
EP 0 911 342, US, Pat, No. 5,843,678, WO 98/46751, W0
98/54201). Both RANKL and RANK expression have been
observed in primary breast cancers in humans and breast
cancer cells lines and it has been proposed that the RANKL/
RANK system can regulate bone metastases of epithelial
tumorsM without an effect on proliferation or death suscep-
tibility.
[0018] US 2008/107597 and WO 2010/022120 A1
describe anti-RANKL antibodies and their use for inhibiting
bone loss associated with a multitude of diseases or for the
treatment of “RANKL-associated diseases”.
[0019] In W0 02/098362 the treatment of cancer in non-
hypercalcemic patients with a RANK antagonist is pro-
posed. However no therapy was developed and this patent
family was ﬁnally abandoned.
[0020] Established uses of RANKL for treating diseases
associated with bone and calcium metabolism and inﬂam-
matory conditions are described eg. in W0 2007/ 128564.
[0021] Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers
in humans and will on average aﬂect up to one in eight
women in their life time in the US and Europe. The
Women’s Health Initiative (WHI) and the Million Women
Study have shown that hormone replacement therapy (HRT)
is associated with an increased risk of incident and faml
breast cancer. In particular synthetic progesterone deriva-
tives (progestins) such as medroxyprogesterone acetate
(MPA), used in millions of women for HRT and contracep-
tives, markedly increase the risk of developing breast cancer.
[0022] Estrogene as well as progesterone including its
synthetic derivatives (progestins) are used in combined
hormone replacement therapies (HRT) in postmenopausal
women to ameliorate menopausal symptoms. Estrogene and
progestins may also be used as hormonal contraceptives.
[0023] Tamoxifen is an antagonist of the estrogen receptor
in breast tissue. It is a standard endocrine (anti-estrogen)
therapy for hormone-positive early breast cancer in post-
menopausal women. It would also inhibit hormone replace-
ment therapies by blocking the estrogen receptor
[0024] It is a goal of the present application to provide
therapeutic methods and means for preventing or treating
cancer.
[0025] The present invention relates to the speciﬁc role of
RANKL in cancer and methods and means to interfere in the
cancer associated RANKL mechanism for therapeutic or
prophylactic purposes. It was found that RANKL is respon-
sible for protecting cells from cancerogenous mutations as it
prevents cell death after such mutations induced by DNA
damage: Survival of cells despite transforming mutations is
one key property of cancer cells. The newly discovered role
of RANKL in this activity allows the inhibition of RANKL

y-irradiation (FIG. 17b,c) or doxorubicin (FIG. 180,b). Sur-
prisingly, RANKL treatment resulted in a marked protection
from cell death in response to y-irradiation (FIG. 17b,c) and
doxorubicin-induced DNA damage (FIG. 18a, b). Mechanis-
tically, y-irradiation-induced upregulation of the pro-apop-
totic molecules Bim, Puma, and Noxa did not occur in the
presence of RANKL (FIG. 180). In vivo it has been shown
that y-irradiation of female mice results in a 5-fold induction
of apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells”). Therefore this
previously established system was used to assess the effects
of the MPA-RANKL/RANK axis on y-irradiation—induced
cell death. MPA treatment indeed protected from y-irradia-
tion-induced apoptosis of mammary epithelial cells in vivo.
Loss of RANK expression on mammary epithelial cells
abrogated the protective effects of MPA on y-irradiation-
induced cell death (FIG. 3ﬁg). Moreover, the IKKa pathway
was involved in MPA-induced protection of the mammary
epithelium after y-irradiation (FIG. 19a,b). Thus, in addition
to promoting cell cycle progression, MPA can protect from
cell death after DNA damage via RANKL/RANK and IKKa
signaling.

Example 20: Tumor Initiating Stem Cells

[0135] Recently it has been shown in humans and mice
that mammary tumors might arise from stem cell popula-
tions”. Therefore it was tested whether loss of RANK
affects mammary cancer stem cells, i.e. tumor initiating cells
(TICs). Tle can be functionally assayed by their ability to
form non-adherent mammospheresm. Freshly isolated can-
cer cells from control and RANKA'M'" females were able to
form primary mamrnospheres, however, after dispersion into
single cells the ability to form secondary mamrnospheres
was signiﬁcantly impaired using TICs from RANKA'W'"
mice (FIG. 4a,b). These data indicate that loss of RANK
activity or expression markedly impairs the self-renewal
capacity of cancer stem cells.

Example 21: Discussion

[0136] Based on these results the following molecular
mechanism how hormones such as MPA drive cancer via
RANKL is apparent: MPA triggers an enormous induction of
RANKL in the mammary gland. The induction of RANKL
in response to MPA requires expression of the prolactin
receptor and possibly other intermediates RANKL via
RANK on mammary epithelial cells drives these cells into
the cell cycle and, importantly, protects mouse as well as
human mammary gland epithelial cells from apoptosis in
response to DNA damage including y-irradiation. Moreover,
RANKL—/RANK control self renewal of mammary cancer
stem cells and anchorage-independent growth. Thus, pro-
gestin—induced RANKL/RANK provide a growth and sur-
vival advantage to damaged mammary epithelium, a pre-
requisite to initiate mammary cancer“. These effects are, at
least in part, mediated via the IKKa-NFKB signaling path-
way. Millions of women take progesterone-derivatives in
contraceptives and for hormonal replacement therapy. Such
hormones have been epidemiologically linked to an
increased risk to develop breast cancer. The present inven-
tion shows that the RANKL-RANK system is an important
molecular link between progestins and epithelial carcino-
genesis. RANKL inhibition is therefore a novel approach to
prevent and/or treat cancer. RANKL inhibition can also be
used to prime cancer cells for anti-cancer therapy such as
based on radiation or other DNA damaging agents.

activity to treat and prevent cancer development and pro-
gression. Although RANKL involvement was known during
bone metastasis formation due to effects on osteoclast and
osteoblasts, it was not known that RANKL can have a direct
effect on cancer cell formation,

[0026] The present invention relates to a cancer therapy
using a RANKL inhibitor as active agent, especially in the
prevention or treatment of primary tumours apart from
metastatic cancer cells,

[0027] According to the present invention a cancer therapy
is to be understood as the reduction of cancer cells in the
body of a patient or at least the prevention of further
progression of the disease RANKL inhibitors include anti-
bodies widely known e.g. from US 2008/107597, WO
2010/022120 A1, US. Pat. No. 6,740,522, U.S. Pat, No,
7,411,050, EP 2003203 A1, or polypeptide inhibitors dis-
closed in US 2004/ 1670721 Any of these prior RANKL
inhibitors can be used according to the present invention.
[0028] RANKL is a known ligand of cell surface receptor
RANK that regulates function of dendritic cells and oste-
clasts. According to the present invention, a further mecha-
nism in the development of cancer has been discovered.
RANKL drives hormone-inﬂuenced cancer development,
Such hormones may be of the normal hormonal background
in any individual or may have been artiﬁcially administered
(such as in hormone replacement therapies, in menopause
treatment or as contraceptive) Furthermore, the cellular
mechanism and activity of this ligand in cancer has been
investigated and characterized.

[0029] The eifect of RANKL, “RANKL activity”,
includes binding of RANKL to RANK and its resulting
activation. RANK in turn further activates IKKa, IKBa,
PiNFKB and cyclinDl as well as the Id2-p21, MAPK Erk
and p38 pathway. Modifying activity of any of these factors
can be used for a therapeutic or prophylactic method or to
reduce cancer cell viability. Most of these proteins are
intracellular and it is possible to inhibit their function by
intracellular inhibition of their activity or expression such as
by RNAi. RANKL and RANK are extracellular targets but
may also be targeted intracellular (e.g. by RNAi),

[003 0] According to the invention it was found that in vivo
administration of progestins such as MPA triggers massive
induction of the key osteoclast differentiation factor Recep-
tor Activator of NF-B Ligand (RANKL) in cells Inhibition
or inactivation of RANKL or its receptor RANK in these
cells prevents progestin-induced proliferation. Importantly,
RANKL/RANK inhibition results in a markedly reduced
incidence and delayed onset of progestin-driven cancer and
reduced self-renewal capacity of cancer stem cells, Although
RANKL is known to inﬂuence bone metastasis of tumors,
the present invention provides for the ﬁrst time the possi-
bility to treat cancer in general and cancer independent of
metastasis, which metastasis is not target of the inventive
treatment, Preferably the cancer is a primary tumor. The
cancer may be non-metastatic.

[0031] In prior publications (W0 02/098362) it was sug-
gested to use RANK antagonists in cancer therapy. However
no therapy was ﬁnally developed based on this suggestion,
According to the present invention, particular preferred
targets are cells dependent on hormone signalling for
growth A significant factor in RANK/RANKL driven can-
cer development is the hormonal background According to
the invention RANK/RANKL’s cancerogenous eifect has
been associated with sexual hormones, in particular proges-

Jan. 31, 2019

terone and its derivatives (progestins), that are widely
administered to females in hormone replacement therapies
or as contraceptives. Therefore a RANK/RANKL antago-
nizing therapy according to a preferred embodiment is for
treating patients with elevated sexual hormones or of their
functional derivatives One cancer treated or prevented
according to the present invention is breast cancer, including
primary breast cancer

[0032] In preferred embodiments the cancer is a cancer
dependent on hormones for growth Such hormones may be
sexual hormones, such as female sexual hormones like
progesterone or estrogene. The cancer cells may have hor-
mone receptors, especially progesterone receptors and/or
estrogene receptors. Examples of estrogene receptors are
ESRl (comprising ER alpha chains), ESR2 (comprising
ER-beta chains) or heteromeric receptors, such as of mixed
ER-alpha and ER-beta chains. Presence of such receptors
may indicate a requirement of hormone signalling in the cell.
In particular, this signalling may be RANKL-mediated.
Preferably the hormone signalling is mediated by the pro-
gesterone receptor, In special embodiments the cancer com-
prises cancer cells with a progesterone receptor but without
functional estrogene receptor.

[0033] Activation of RANKL by hormones protects the
cancer or a pre-cancerous cell from DNA damage induced
cell death Thus these hormones may support cancer via
increased RANKL activity, Preferred types of cancer diag-
nosed according to the present invention are cancers with
sexual hormone dependency during development, especially
breast cancer or prostate cancer, Further types of cancer
include Hodgkin’s lymphoma; non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma;
B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma; T—cell
acute lymphoblastic leukemia/lymphoma; peripheral T-cell
leukemia, adult T-cell leukemia/T-cell lymphoma; NK cell
tumor; large granular lymphocytic leukemia; Langerhans
cell histiocytosis; myeloid neoplasia; acute myelogenous
leukemia; acute promyelocytic leukemia; acute myelomono-
cytic leukemia; acute monocytic leukemia; a myelodysplas-
tic syndrome; and a chronic myeloproliferative disorder. In
particular preferred the cancer is selected from lung cancer,
breast cancer, mammary cancer, melanoma, sarcoma, pros-
tate cancer, head and neck cancer, cancer of unknown
primary origin, lymphoma, leukemia, kidney cancer, and
gastrointestinal cancer Preferably the cancer is a hormone
driven-cancer like breast or prostate cancer. Such hormones
may be female sexual hormones like estrogen or progester-
one, or artiﬁcial functional equivalents thereof like proges-
tins or other factors known to induce RANKL such as
PTHrP (Parathyroid hormone-related protein) or Vitamin D.
The cancer may be of epithelial origin, Preferably the cancer
is treated or prevented in its origin tissue, such as in the
breast in the case of breast or mammary cancer or in the
prostate for prostate cancer,

[0034] According to the invention the cancer may be a
primary cancer. As shown herein a primary cancerous devel-
opment can be prevented or delayed by inhibiting RANKL
activityi Therefore the primary cancer can be treated or
prevented. In addition it is also possible to prevent or trwt
the development of re-occuning cancer.

[0035] According to one embodiment the invention pro-
vides a RANKL inhibitor for use in the treatment or pre-
vention of cancer in a patient, wherein the patient has
received a hormone treatment, preferably a hormone

[0036] “Treatment” shall be construed as a beneﬁcial
effect on cancer patients, in particular as a reduction of
cancer cells, including preventing further progression of
cancer, but not necessarily in an absolute curative sense,
which is of course possible but not necessarily required by
the invention.

[0037] Similar, “preventing” shall not be construed as an
absolute success to always prevent the onset of cancer, but
as a relative reduction of the risk of developing cancer in a
patient or of delaying onset of cancer, i.e. as a prophylactic
treatment, The prevention of cancer is a particular advantage
of the present invention. Since RANKL-induced protection
against apoptosis is a fundamental step in the development
of cancer, it is now possible to inhibit this step in cancerous
developments and prevent for a certain time or delay cancer
manifestation, The treatment or prevention according to the
present invention can be used to treat benign tumors or
nodules and thus inhibit further development in cancer

[0038] The normal hormonal levels of a patient may
usually be suﬂicient to trigger the RANKL pathway that has
been involved with cancer development according to the
present invention. At certain conditions hormone level may
be increased in a patient, be it for natural or artiﬁcial causes,
Such increased hormone level may increase the RANKL
associated cancer development and progression and there-
fore in a preferred embodiment the patient to be treated
according to the present invention has increased hormone
levels, e.g. blood concentrations, in particular of sexual
hormones such as progesterone (or the synthetic functional
analogous, progestines) or estrogenes, The administration of
female sexual hormones to a patient, be it for a hormone
replacement therapy or as hormone contraceptive (particular
progesterone and its derivatives) increases the risk of cancer
via the RANKL pathway, in particular of hormone driven
cancers such as breast cancer or prostate cancer. Further, any
deregulation of the endogenous progesterone system such as
in pre-menopause may increase the risk of cancer, In turn,
administrating a RANKL inhibitor can decrease the risk of
breast cancer or be used to treat a breast cancer. Mechanis-
tically, RANKL activity protects breast cancer cells from
apoptosis and increases breast cancer survival in View of
cancerogenic mutations. Reducing RANKL activity there-
fore prevents this protective effect and results in increased
cancer cell death,

[0039] The patient might have or might have had a therapy
with sexual hormones, It was found according to the present
invention that RANKL activity in cancer development is
inﬂuenced by sexual hormones, in particular by estrogenes
or progesteron or its dervatives (progestins), Therefore, in
preferred embodiments the patient is treated by a hormone,
preferably receives hormone replacement therapy, prefer-
ably with estrogene, progesterone or a progestin, or with a
hormone contraceptive, Examples of progestins are
medroxyprogesterone (or its acetate, e.g. the 17-acetate),
norethisterone, ethisterone, norethynodrel, norethindrone
acetate, ethynodiol diacetate, levonorgestrel, norgestrel,
desogestrel, gestodene, norgestimate, drospirenone,
dienogest, nesterone, nomegestrol acetate, trimegestrone,
tanaproget, megestrol acetate, pranone, etonogestrcl. The
hormone or derivative preferably has progestinic effects, In
particular the hormone may induce RANKL.

[0040] In hormone replacement therapies or by using
hormone contraceptives, the hormone level, in general of
sexual hormones, is upregulated leading to increased pro-
gesterone levels that could be tied to development of cancer
via the RANKL pathway according to the present invention.
Therefore, patients which receive or have been treated by a
hormone or hormone contraceptive are at an increased risk
of developing breast cancer, For these patients, administer-
ing a RANKL inhibitor is particularly effective for trwting
or preventing cancer, cancer development or cancer progres-
sron.

[0041] In particular high progestin and/or progesterone
levels that may be found in a patient to be treated are e.g.
serum concentration or at least 02 ng/ml, preferably at least
03 ng/ml

[0042] A “RANKL inhibitor” is to be understood as any
compound or agent, that reduces RANKL activity. It
includes any RANKL ligand, in particular anti-RANKL-
antibodies, that inactivates free RANKL and prevents com-
petitively its binding to and activation of RANK, Further
RANKL inhibitors include RANK antagonists that block
RANK, RANKLs cellular receptor. Furthermore, any factor
in RANKLs signalling pathway, including RANKL itself,
RANK, lKKoL, lKBot, P-N'FKB, cyclinDl (NFKB pathway
inhibition), Id2, MAPK Erk and p38 can be antagonized or
p21 increased or agonized (Id2 pathway inhibition) to pre-
vent RANKL signalling and reduce RANKL activity. The
Id2 pathway functions as a transcriptional repressor of p21,
on of the major cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, which
inhibits cell cycle progression. Therefore, the Id2 pathway
has to be inhibited for p21 to be upregulated hence stopping
proliferation,

[0043] A RANKL inhibitor can inhibit or antagonize any
one of RANKL itself, RANK, IKKa, IKBa, P-NFKB,
cyclinDl, Id2, MAPK Erk or p38 or increase or agonize p21
or any combination thereof, preferably of at least 2, 3, 4, 5,
or all of these factors, in particular preferred with RANKL.
A RANKL inhibitor may be any compounc that lowers
RANKL concentration, in particular semm concentrations,
or lower RANKL expression. A RANKL inhibitor may
further lower RANK concentration on cell surface, in par-
ticular cancer cell surface, and/or lower RAN{ expression
and/or lower RANK activation in response to RANKL
binding. A RANKL inhibitor may further lower intracellular
concentrations and/or expression and/or activation of lKKot.
A RANKL inhibitor may further lower intracel ular concen-
trations and/or expression and/or activation of lKBu. A
RANKs inhibitor may further lower intracellular concen-
trations and/or expression and/or activation 0 P-NFKB. A
RANKi inhibitor may further lower intracel ular concen-
trations and/or expression and/or activation of cyclinDl. A
RANKi inhibitor may further lower intracel ular concen-
trations and/or expression and/or activation of Id2, A
RANK o inhibitor may further increase intrace lular concen-
trations and/or expression and/or activation of p21. A
RANKe inhibitor may further lower intracel ular concen-
trations and/or expression and/or activation of MAPK Erk.
A RANKL inhibitor may further lower intracellular concen-
trations and/or expression and/or activation 0 p38,

[0044] For antagonizing cellular factors preferably siRNA
molecu es are administered to reduce the expression and
function of these factors, RNA interference (RNAi) is a
mechanism to suppress gene expression in a sequence
speciﬁc manner. RNA interference (RNAi) is highly effec-

A combination of complete inhibition (100% inhibition) and
the absence of regression (0% regression) usually charac-
terize a state of a “stable disease".

[0259] Mean tumor volumes (in mms) were monitored 2
to 3 times a week for the duration of the study (35 days) and
are presented in FIG, 81 The corresponding relative tumor
values, standardized values calculated against individual
tumor volumes at the start of the study and presented as
percent growth are summarized in FIG. 9. Relative tumor
values facilitate direct comparison of the growth curves by
adjusting their origin to a single common starting point,
[0260] Mean body weights ranged from 19.6:0.4 g to
2072015 g (MeanstM) on treatment day (FIG. 10). Great-
est mean body weight loss observed was 4% in group 3
(docetaxel, 20 mglkg) on day 4 followed by group 2 (Doc-
etaxel, 10 mg/kg) at 2% observed on days 4 and 7 (FIG. 11).
No abnormal clinical observations were noted throughout
the study.

[026]] Analysis ofmean tumor volumes on Day 35 (study
termination) using one-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple
comparison post test was performed using GraphPad
Prism® (Ver. 5104), Mean tumor volumes of all the treat-
ment groups demonstrated signiﬁcant diﬁerence from the
vehicle control group. A signiﬁcant diiference was observed
between the 20 kD PEG conjugated docetaxel group versus
free docetaxel at 10 mg/kg, The results are summarized in

through commercial sources, eg. Afﬁbody AB (Stockholm,
Sweden).

[0088] Exemplary, non-limiting targets of the binding
moiety are described below

[0089] Carbonic anhydrase IX (CAIX) is a transmem-
brane protein expressed in greater than 90% of all clear-cell
renal cell carcinoma. Bui el al., (2004) Clin. Cancer Res,
vol. 9, p. 802, CAIX is viewed as an independent predictor
of survival in clear cell renal carcinoma. CAIX expression
has also been implicated in other forms of cancer, such as
prostate cancer. CAIX is believed to be associated with
tumor hypoxia, a condition where tumors lack suﬂicient
oxygen, Swinson et al., (2003) Journal of Clin. Oncology,
vol. 21, no, 3, pp. 473-482. Hypoxic tumors may be resistant
to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. CAIX has also been
implicated in a poor prognosis for non-small cell lung
cancer. In instances where a binding moiety targeting CAIX
is used as the binding moiety within the compounds of the
invention, the overall compound targets CAIX. Thus, when
a binding moiety targeting CAIX is used in the compounds
of the invention, the pharmacologically active agent may be
one known to treat a disease associated with CAIX expres-
sion. In certain embodiments, the pharmacologically active
agent may be chosen from an agent useful for the treatment
of certain cancers, such as for example, clear-cell renal
carcinoma.

[0090] CD33 (Siglec-3) is a transmembrane receptor and
generally understood as a myeloid speciﬁc member of the
sialic acid-binding receptor family CD33 is expressed
highly on myeloid progenitor cells but at much lower levels
in differentiated cells. The CD33 antigen is expressed on a
number of hematologic malignancies, including acute
myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myeloid leukemia

Jan. 31, 2019

(CML), myelodysplastic syndrome and several myelopro-
liferative disorders. In instances where a binding moiety
targeting CD33 is used as the binding moiety within the
compounds of the invention, the overall compound targets
CD33. Thus, when a binding moiety targeting CD33 is used
in the compounds of the invention, the pharmacologically
active agent may be one known to treat a disease associated
with CD33 expression. In certain embodiments, the phar-
macologically active agent may be chosen from an agent
useful for the treatment of acute myeloid leukemia (AML),
chronic myeloid leukemia (CIVIL), and myelodysplastic
syndrome.

[0091] CD30 is a cell membrane protein of the tumor
necrosis factor receptor family and a tumor marker. CD30 is
considered a deﬁning marker for Hodgkin’s lymphoma as
well as other hematological cancers, such as anaplastic large
cell lymphoma, Antibody drug conjugates targeting CD30
are currently being developed, including Brentuximab vedo-
tin (Seattle Genetics). In instances where a binding moiety
targeting CD30 is used as the binding moiety within the
compounds of the invention, the overall compound targets
CD30. Thus, when a binding moiety targeting CD30 is used
in the compounds of the invention, the pharmacologically
active agent may be one known to treat a disease associated
with CD30 expression. In certain embodiments, the phar-
macologically active agent may be chosen from an agent
useful for the treatment of hematological cancers, such as
Hodgkin’s lymphoma and anaplastic large cell lymphoma.

[0092] CD22 is a receptor found on B-cells. It is present
in over 90% of B-lymphoid malignancies, making it an
attractive target for treating B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma
(B-NHL). Ogura et al,, (2010) Cancer Sci., 101 (8), pp,
1840-5. CD-22 may also be expressed in other B-cell
chronic lymphoproliferative disorders (e.g. B cell precursor
acute lymphoblastic leukiemia). In instances where a bind-
ing moiety targeting CD22 is used as the binding moiety
within the compounds of the invention, the overall com-
pound targets CD22. Thus, when a binding moiety targeting
CD22 is used in the compounds of the invention, the
pharmacologically active agent may be one known to treat
a disease associated with CD22 expression. In certain
embodiments, the pharmacologically active agent may be
chosen from an agent useful for the treatment of certain
leukemias and lymphomas, such as B-cell non-Hodgkin
lymphoma.

[0093] 5T4 (T rophoblast glycoprotein) is a transmem-
brance glycoprotein expressed in various carcinomas. It is
associated with various cancers, including gastric, colorec-
tal, pancreatic, renal (e.g. renal cell carcinoma), and non-
small cell lung carcinoma. In instances where a binding
moiety targeting 5T4 is used as the binding moiety within
the compounds of the invention, the overall compound
targets 5T4. Thus, when a binding moiety targeting 5T4 is
used in the compounds of the invention, the pharmacologi-
cally active agent may be one known to treat a disease
associated with 5T4 expression. In certain embodiments, the
pharmacologically active agent may be chosen from an
agent useful for the treatment of certain cancers, including
for example, gastric cancer, colorectal cancer, pancreatic
cancer, renal (eg. renal cell carcinoma), and non-small cell
lung carcinoma.

[0094] Myostatin, also referred to as growth diﬁerentia-
tion factor 8, is a member of the TGF-B superfamily of
proteins. Myostatin is expressed largely in developing and
US 2019/0030182 A1

another PEG chain; urethane linkages formed from reaction
of, e.g., a PEG with a terminal isocyanate group and a PEG
alcohol; peptide linkages formed by an amine group, e.g., at
an end of a polymer such as PEG, and a carboxyl group of
a peptide; and oligonuclcotide linkages formed by. for
example, a phosphoramidite group, eg, at the end of a
polymer, and a 5' hydroxyl group of an oligonucleotide.
[0126] The polymer is typically biocompatible and non-
immunogenic. With respect to biocompatibility, a substance
is considered biocompatible if the beneﬁcial eﬁects associ-
ated with use of the substance alone or with another sub-
stance (e,g., an active agent) in connection with living
tissues (eg, administration to a patient) outweighs any
deleterious elfects as evaluated by a clinician, eg, a phy-
sician. With respect to non-immunogenicity, a substance is
considered non-immunogenic if use of the substance alone
or with another substance in connection with living tissues
does not produce an immune response (eg, the formation of
antibodies) or, if an immune response is produced, that such
a response is not deemed clinically signiﬁcant or important
as evaluated by a clinician.

[0127] In certain embodiments, because of its water-solu-
bility, non-immunogenicity and biocompatibility, poly(eth-
ylene glycol) it is a polymer for use in the each of the
polymer-active agent conjugate populations of the compo-
sitions described herein. Structurally, poly(ethylene glycol)
is a linear polymer terminated at each end with hydroxyl

groups:
H07CH2CH20~(CH2CHQO)Mr—CHECHQAOI-I

wherein (m‘) is a positive integer representing the number of
repeating monomers (typically from about 2 to about 4000).
Conveniently, poly(ethylcne glycol) can be abbreviated as
“PEG” and whenever a stmcture is presented wherein
“PEG” appears, it will be assumed that the following struc-
ture applies:

7CHQCHQO~(CHQCHQO)Mr—CI-Ichli

wherein (m') is as previously deﬁned.

[0128] As contemplated by the above structures of For-
mula II (cg, [Ab-X1-P0LY],,-Ql-R-QZ-[POLY-XZ-Drk),
the compound has a number of arms, cg, from 3 to about 50.
An exemplary number of arms includes 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and
10. In one or more embodiments, the compounds of the
invention are prepared from multi-armed polymer reagents,
which, in tum, are prepared from multi-arm polymers based
on a multi-arrn core molecule

[0129] For example, in one approach, a multi-arm polymer
can be prepared from a multi-arm core molecule by elfec-
tively “growing” a polymer onto each terminus of a multi-
ann core molecule. By way of non-limiting example, it is
possible to synthesize a polymer arm onto a polyol (e.g.,
pentaerythritol, diglycerol, etc.) via an cthoxylation reac-
tion In another exemplary approach, a multi-arm polymer
can be prepared from a multi-arm core molecule by attach-
ing a water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer onto each termi-
nus of a multi-arm core molecule. The principles of both
approaches are described in the literature and in, for
example, U.S. Pat. No. 7,026,440, The invention, however,
is not limited with regard to the speciﬁc approach taken.
[0130] In one or more embodiments, the residue of the
polyol, polythiol or polyamine, “R,” used in connection with
the multi-arm polymer is an organic radical-containing
moiety possessing from about 3 to about 150 carbon atoms
(eg, from about 3 to about 50 carbon atoms, such as 3, 4,

Jan. 3], 2019

5, 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10). The residue may contain one more
heteroatoms (e.g., O, S, or N). In addition, the residue may
be linear. In some instances, the residue may be cyclic.

[0131] As previously indicated, the residue of the polyol,
polythiol or polyamine, “R," that forms the basis of the
branching for the multi-arrned compounds provided herein,
originated from a corresponding polyol, polythiol or
polyamine (prior to be incorporated into the multi-arm
structures containing a water-soluble, non-peptidic poly-
mer). In one or more embodiments, the corresponding
polyol, polythiol, or a polyamine bears at least three
hydroxyl, thiol, or amino groups, respectively, available for
polymer attachment, A “polyol” is a molecule comprising
three or more hydroxyl groups A “polythiol” is a molecule
that comprises three or more thiol groups. A “polyamine” is
a molecule comprising three or more amino groups.

[0132] In one or more embodiments, the polyol,
polyamine or polythiol will typically contain 3 to about 25
hydroxyl, or amino groups or thiol groups, respectively, such
as from 3 to about 10 (i.e., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, l0) hydroxyl,
amino groups or thiol groups, respectively, preferably from
3 to about 8 Ge, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8) hydroxyl, amino groups
or thiol groups, respectively. In one or more embodiments,
the number of atoms between each hydroxyl, thiol, or amino
group will vary, although lengths of from about 1 to about
20 (eg, from 1 to about 5) intervening atoms, such as
carbon atoms, between each hydroxyl, thiol or amino group,
are exemplary. In referring to intervening core atoms and
lengths, iCHZi is considered as having a length of one
intervening atom, ACHZCHzi is considered as having a
length of two atoms, and so forth.

[0133] Exemplary polyols and polyamincs (for which cor-
responding residucs could be present in the compounds
provided herein) have (Radical)-(OH)a and (Radical)-
(N Hz)“ structures, respectively, where (Radical) corresponds
to an organic-containing radical and q is a positive integer
from 3 to about 50. Note that the variable “Q,” when taken
together with R, typically represents a residue of the core
organic radical as described herein. That is to say, when
describing polyols, polythiols and polymer amines, particu-
larly by name, these molecules are being referenced in their
form prior to incorporation into a water-soluble polymer-
containing structure. So, for example, a compound of For-
mula II wherein R is a residue of the polyol, pentaerythritol
[C(CHZOHL], the residue “R” includes carbon (i,e., “C,”)
and together with with “Q” represents “C(CH20~)4.”

[0134] Illustrative polyols include aliphatic polyols having
from 1 to 10 carbon atoms and from 3 to 10 hydroxyl groups,
including for example, trihydroxyalkanes, tetrahydroxyal-
kanes, polyhydroxy alkyl ethers, polyhydroxyalkyl
polyethers, and the like. Cycloaliphatic polyols includc
straight chained or closed-ring sugars and sugar alcohols,
such as mannitol, sorbitol, inositol, xylitol, quebrachitol,
threitol, arabitol, erythritol, adonitol, dulcitol, facose, ribose,
arabinose, xylose, lyxose, rhamnose, galactose, glucose,
fructose, sorbose, mannose, pyranose, altrose, talose, tagi-
tose, pyranosides, sucrose, lactose, maltose, and the like.
Additional examples of aliphatic polyols include derivatives
of glucose, ribose, mannose, galactose, and related stercoi-
somers. Aromatic polyols may also be used, such as l,l,l-
tris(4'-hydroxyphenyl) alkanes, such as l,l,l-tris(4-hy-
droxyphenyl)ethane, 2,6-bis(hydroxyalkyl)cresols, and the
like. Other core polyols that may be used include polyhy-
droxycrown ethers, cyclodextrins, dextrins and other carbo-

suppository; and a troche. In certain embodiments, the
composition will be in a unit dosage form to thereby provide
a unit dosage suitable for single administration of a dosage
of each active component in the unit dosage form. Suitable
pharmaceutical compositions and dosage forms may be
prepared using conventional methods known to those in the
ﬁeld of pharmaceutical formulation and described in the
pertinent texts and literature, erg, in Remington’s Pharma-
ceutical Sciences: 18“ Edition, Gennaro, A. R., Ed. (Mack
Publishing Company; Easton, Pa, 1990).

[0173] Oral dosage forms include tablets, capsules,
caplets, gel caps, troches, solutions, suspensions, and syrups.
Tablets and capsules represent the most convenient oral
dosage forms.

[0174] Tablets can be manufactured using standard tablet
processing procedures and equipment. Preferred techniques
for forming tablets include direct compression and granu-
lation, In addition to the active agents, tablets will generally
contain inactive, pharmaceutically acceptable carrier mate-
rials such as binders, lubricants, isintegrants, ﬁllers, stabi-
lizers, surfactants, coloring agents, and the like. Binders are
used to impart cohesive qualities to a tablet, and thus ensure
that the tablet remains intact, Suitable binder materials
include, but are not limited to, starch (including corn starch
and pregelatinized starch), ge atin, sugars (including
sucrose, glucose, dextrose and lactose), polyethylene glycol,
waxes, and natural and synthetic gums, e.g., acacia sodium
alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, ce lulosic polymers (includ-
ing hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methylccllu-
lose, methyl cellulose, microcrystalline cellulose, ethyl cel-
lulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, and the like), and Veegum.
Lubricants are used to facilitate ta alet manufacture, promot-
ing powder ﬂow and preventing article capping (i.e., par-
ticle breakage) when pressure is relieved. Useful lubricants
are magnesium stearate, calcium stearate, and stearic acid.
Disintegrants are used to facilitate disintegration of the
tablet, and are generally starches, clays. celluloses, algins,
gums, or crosslinked polymers, Fi lers include, for example,
materials such as silicon dioxide, titanium dioxide, alumina,
talc, kaolin, powdered cellulose, and microcrystalline cel-
lulose, as well as soluble materia s such as mannitol, urea,
sucrose, lactose, dextrose, sodium chloride, and sorbitol.
Stabilizers, as well known in the art, are used to inhibit or
retard drug decomposition reactions that include, by way of
example, oxidative reactions.

[0175] In some instances, the tablet can be in the form of
a uniform tablet. In uniform tablets, the formulation used in
preparing the tablet is a substantially homogenous mixture
of active agents and one or more pharmaceutical excipient
(e,g,, diluent), The formulation is then used to make tablets
using a suitable tableting process to thereby result in a tablet
that is substantially homogenous throughout the tablet.
[017 6] In still other instances, the tablet can also take the
form of a layered tablet (of one, two, three or more layers).
The method for manufacturing the layered tablet can include
combining two different formulations (e.g., one formulation
containing the opioid agonist and another containing the
polymer-opioid conjugate) and compressing the two
together to form the tablet. Multiple layered tablets of three
or more layers are also possible and can be formed, for
example, in a similar manner by combining three or more
distinct formulations and followed by compression.

[0177] Optionally, a barrier layer can be included in the
layered tablet. One approach for incorporating a banier

 

Jan. 3], 2019

layers involves forming a compressed ﬁrst layer of a ﬁrst
formulation (e.g,, a formulation containing a ﬁrst active
agent) wherein the compress layers has one exposed surface,
coating the exposed surface with a material (e.g., a material
that is substantially impermeable to thereby prevent physical
interaction between adjacent layers) to form a coated sur-
face, and contacting the coated surface with a second
formulation (e,g., a second formulation containing a second
active agent), and compressing the second formulation and
coated surface to form a layered tablet having a barrier layer
included therein.

[0178] Capsules are also oral dosage forms, in which case
the composition may be encapsulated in the form of a liquid,
semi-solid or solid (including particulates such as granules,
beads, powders or pellets). Suitable capsules may be either
hard or soft, and are generally made of gelatin, starch, or a
cellulosic material, with gelatin capsules preferred. Two-
piece hard gelatin capsules are preferably sealed, such as
with gelatin bands or the like, See, for example, Reming-
ton’s Pharmaceutical Sciences, supra, which describes mate-
rials and methods for preparing encapsulated pharmaceuti-
cals.

[0179] The pharmaceutical preparations can also be
administered via injection and can therefore be liquid solu-
tions or suspensions immediately prior to administration,
Other modes of administration are also included, such as
pulmonary, rectal, transdermal, transmucosal, oral, intrath-
ecal, subcutaneous, intra-arterial, and so forth Advanta-
geously, the pharmaceutical preparation (as well as the
composition) can be provided in a unit dosage form. In
addition, the pharmaceutical preparation (as well as the
composition) can be used in a vial (e.g,, a glass vial or a
plastic vial) or in a syringe to provide a preﬁlled syringe.

[0180] As previously described, the pharmaceutical prepa-
ration can be injected parenterally by intravenous injection,
or by intramuscular or by subcutaneous injection. Suitable
formulation types for parenteral administration include
ready-for—injection solutions, dry powders for combination
with a solvent prior to use, suspensions ready for injection.
dry insoluble compositions for combination with a vehicle
prior to use, and emulsions and liquid concentrates for
dilution prior to administration, among others. Typically, the
preparation is provided in a dry form (e.g., lyophilized form)
for storage and is reconstituted with a suitable liquid diluent,
Preferred liquid diluents are selected from the group con-
sisting of bacteriostatic water for injection, dextrose 5% in
water, phosphate-buffered saline, Ringer’s solution, saline
solution, sterile water, deionized water, and combinations
thereof

[0181] Exemplary excipients of the pharmaceutical prepa-
rations include, without limitation, those selected from the
group consisting of carbohydrates, inorganic salts, antimi-
crobial agents, antioxidants, surfactants, buffers, acids,
bases, and combinations thereof

[0182] A carbohydrate such as a sugar, a derivatized sugar
such as an alditol, aldonic acid, an esteriﬁed sugar, and/or a
sugar polymer may be present as an excipient. Speciﬁc
carbohydrate excipients include, for example: monosaccha-
rides, such as fructose, maltose, galactose, glucose, D-man-
nose, sorbose, and the like; disaccharides, such as lactose,
sucrose, trehalose, cellobiose, and the like; polysaccharides,
such as raﬁinose, melezitose, maltodextrins, dextrans,
US 2019/0030182 A1

starches, and the like; and alditols, such as mannitol, xylitol,
maltitol, lactitol, sorbitol (glucitol), pyranosyl sorbitol, myo-
inositol, and the like.

[0183] The excipient can also include an inorganic salt or
buffer such as citric acid, sodium chloride, potassium chlo-
ride, sodium sulfate, potassium nitrate, sodium phosphate
monobasic, sodium phosphate dibasic, and combinations
thereof.

[0184] The preparation may also include an antimicrobial
agent for preventing or deterring microbial growth, Non-
limiting examples of antimicrobial agents suitable for the
present invention include benzalkonium chloride, benzetho-
nium chloride, benzyl alcohol, cetylpyridinium chloride,
chlorobutanol, phenol, phenylethyl alcohol, phenylmercuric
nitrate, thirnersol, and combinations thereof

[0185] An antioxidant can be present in the preparation as
well. Antioxidants are used to prevent oxidation, thereby
preventing the deterioration of the conjugate or other com-
ponents of the preparation. Suitable antioxidants for use in
the present invention include, for example, ascorbyl palmi-
tate, butylated hydroxyanisole, butylated hydroxytoluene,
hypophosphorous acid, monothioglycerol, propyl gallate,
sodium bisulﬁte, sodium formaldehyde sulfoxylate, sodium
membisulﬁte, and combinations thereof

[0186] A surfactant may be present as an excipient, Exem-
plary surfactants include: polysorbates, such as “Tween 20”
and “Tween 80,” and pluronics such as F68 and F88 (both
of which are available from BASF, Mount Olive, Nil);
sorbitan esters; lipids, such as phospholipids such as lecithin
and other phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines
(although preferably not in liposomal form), fatty acids and
fatty esters; steroids, such as cholesterol; and chelating
agents, such as EDTA, zinc and other such suitable cations,
[0187] Acids or bases may be present as an excipient in the
preparation. Nonlimiting examples of acids that can be used
include those acids selected from the group consisting of
hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, citric acid,
malic acid, lactic acid, formic acid, trichloroacetic acid,
nitric acid, perchloric acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid,
fumaric acid, and combinations thereof. Examples of suit-
able bases include, without limitation, bases selected from
the group consisting of sodium hydroxide, sodium acetate,
ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium
acetate, potassium acetate, sodium phosphate, potassium
phosphate, sodium citrate, sodium fonnate, sodium sulfate,
potassium sulfate, potassium fumerate, and combinations
thereof.

[0188] The pharmaceutical preparations encompass all
types of formulations. The amount of the active agents (i.e,,
compounds of the present invention) in the composition will
vary depending on a number of factors, but will optimally be
a therapeutically effective dose of each active agent when
the composition is stored in a unit dose form. A therapeu-
tically effective dose for each active agent can be determined
experimentally by repeated administration of increasing
amounts of the active agent in order to determine which
amount produces a clinically desired endpoint.

[0189] The amount of any individual excipient in the
composition will vary depending on the activity of the
excipient and particular needs of the composition, Typically,
the optimal amount of any individual excipient is deter-
mined through routine experimentation, i.e,, by preparing
compositions containing varying amounts of the excipient
(ranging from low to high), examining the stability and other

Jan. 31, 2019

parameters, and then determining the range at which optimal
performance is attained with no signiﬁcant adverse effects.
[0190] Generally, however, the excipient will be present in
the composition in an amount of about 1% to about 99% by
weight, preferably from about 2%-98% by weight, more
preferably from about 5-95% by weight of the excipient,
with concentrations less than 30% by weight most preferred.
[0191] These foregoing pharmaceutical excipients along
with other excipients are described in “Remington: The
Science & Practice of Pharmacy”, 19’” ed., Williams &
Williams, (1995), the “Physician’s Desk Reference”, 52"‘1
ed, Medical Economics, Montvale, NJ, (1998), and Kibbe,
A. H, Handbook of Pharmaceutical Excipients, 3"i Edition,
American Pharmaceutical Association, Washington, DC,
2000.

[0192] The invention also provides a method for admin-
istering the pharmaceutical preparation as provided herein to
a patient suffering from a condition that is responsive to
treatment with the compound. The method comprises
administering a therapeutically effective amount of the com-
pound (e.g, provided as part of a pharmaceutical composi-
tion). The method of administering may be used to treat any
condition that can be remedied or prevented by administra-
tion of the particular compound. Those of ordinary skill in
the art appreciate which conditions a speciﬁc compound can
effectively treat (and typically is a same condition for which
agent selected from the group consisting of small molecule
drugs, toxins and radioactive substances is used to treat). For
example, when the binding agent is a HERZ binding Aﬁi-
body® and the pharmacologically active agent is chosen
from one that may treat the underlying condition associated
with HERZ overexpression, the compound of the present
invention may be used to treat that underlying disease
associated with HER2 overexpressioni By means of a non-
limiting example, conditions associated with HER2 over
expression include breast cancer, ovarian cancer, pancreatic
cancer, stomach cancer, salivary cancer, lung cancer, and
esophageal cancer. In such cases, by means of a non-limiting
example, the pharmacologically active agent is chosen from
docetaxel, paclitaxel, anthracylcin, topotecan, gemcitabine
and lapatinibi

[0193] The actual dose to be administered will vary
depend upon the age, weight, and general condition of the
subject as well as the severity of the condition being treated,
the judgment of the health care professional, and compound
being administered. Therapeutically effective amounts are
known to those skilled in the art and/or are described in the
pertinent reference texts and literature. Generally, a thera-
peutically effective amount will range from about 0.001 mg
to 1,0 g, in certain embodiments in doses from 0.01 mg/day
to 750 mg/day, in certain embodiments from about 010
mg/day to 500 mg/day. These values may include the
amount of the compound of the present invention. These
values may also include the effective amount of the phar-
macologically active agent in the compound of the present
invention.

[0194] The unit dosage of any given compound (in certain
embodiments, provided as part of a pharmaceutical prepa-
ration) can be administered in a variety of dosing schedules
depending on the judgment of the clinician, needs of the
patient, and so forth. The speciﬁc dosing schedule will be
known by those of ordinary skill in the art or can be
determined experimentally using routine methods. Exem-
plary dosing schedules include, without limitation, admin-
US 2019/0030182 A1

hydrates (e.g,, monosaccharides, oligosaccharides, and
polysaccharides, starches and amylase),

[0135] Exemplary polyols include glycerol, trimethylol-
propane, pentaerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythri-
tol, ethoxylated forms of glycerol, trimethylolpropane, pen-
taerythritol, dipentaerythritol, tripentaerythritoli Also,
preferred are reducing sugars such as sorbitol and glycerol
oligomers, such as diglycerol, triglycerol, hexaglycerol and
the like. A 21-arm polymer can be synthesized using
hydroxypropyl-B-cyclodextrin,which has 21 available
hydroxyl groups. Additionally, a polyglycerol having an
average of 24 hydroxyl groups is also included as an
exemplary polyol,

[0136] Exemplary polyamines include aliphatic
polyamines such as diethylene triamine, N,N‘,N"-trimethyl-
diethylene triamine, pentamethyl diethylene triamine, trieth-
ylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine, pentaethylene
hexamine, dipropylene triamine, tripropylene tetramine, bis-
(3-aminopropyl)—amine, bis-(3-aminopropyl)—methylamine,
and N,N-dimethyl-dipropylene-triamine. Naturally occur-
ring polyamines that can be used in the present invention
include putrescine, spermidine, and spemiine. Numerous
suitable pentamines, tetramines, oligoamines, and pentami-
dine analogs suitable for use in the present invention are
described in Bacchi et al. (2002) Antimicrobial Agents and
Chemotherapy, 46(1):55-61, which is incorporated by ref-
erence herein,

[0137] Provided below are illustrative structures corre-
sponding to residues of polyols [although each structure is
depicted with the oxygen atom (“0”) derived from the
corresponding hydroxyl group, each “0” can be substituted
with sulfur (“S”) or NH to depict the corresponding residue
of a polythiol or polyamine, respectively). Note that the
residues shown below would be understood in terms of
compounds of Formula II as corresponding to “R” and “Q.”
In any event, conjugates based on any of the illustrative
structures set forth below are included as part of the inven-
tion.

[0138] Water-soluble, non-peptidic-containing multi-arm
polymers (used as, for example, multi-arm polymeric
reagents to prepare compounds of the invention) based on
the above-described polyols, polythiols and polyamines and
others are described in WO 2007/098466, WO 2010/019233
and US. Pat. No, 7,744,861. These references and others
describe methods for preparing such multi-arm polymers.

[0139] The linkers, Q1 and Q2, serve to connect the residue
of the polyol, polythiol or polyamine bearing at from 3 to
about 50 hydroxyl, thiol or amino groups, “R,” to each
water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer, POLY. In this regard,
the invention is not limited with respect to the speciﬁc linker
used. In one or more embodiments, the linker between the
residue, “R," and the water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer,
POLY, is a hydrolytically stable linker).

[0140] In one or more embodiments of the invention, the
linkers, Q1 and Q2, are inﬂuenced by the approach used to
form the multi-arm polymer employed in preparing the
compounds of the invention, For example, if a water-
soluble, non-peptidic polymer bearing a functional group
reactive to a hydroxyl, thiol or amine is reacted with a
polyol, polythiol or polyamine, respectively, the linkers, Q1
and Q2, may include one or more atoms incorporating the
bond formed between the termini of the polyol, polythiol or
polyamine arid the beginning of the repeating monomers of
the water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer, POLY. Illustrative
linking chemistries in this regard (along with the resulting
linkers) are described in the literature and in, for example,

adult skeletal muscle and functions as a negative regulator of
skeletal muscle. Systemic over-expression of myostatin in
adult mice leads to muscle wasting [Zinnners et a1. (2002)
Science 296:1486-1488], while conversely, a myostatin
knock-out mouse is characterized by hypertrophy and hyper-
plasia of the skeletal muscle resulting in two- to three-fold
greater muscle mass than their wild type littermates and a
decrease in fat accumulation [McPherron et all (1997)
Nature 387283-90]. A human with a myostatin knock-out
mutation was reported to be associated with gross muscle
hypertrophy [Scheulke et al, New Eng. J. Med. 350:2682,
2004). Binding moieties (such as the antibody stamulumab)
targeting myostatin have been described.

[0095] In instances where a binding moiety targeting
myostatin is used as the binding moiety within the com-
pounds of the invention, the overall compound targets
myostatini Thus, when an insulin-like growth factor is used
as the pharmacologically active agent within the compound,
the insulin-like growth factor is localized to myostatin with
the expectation that the resulting species is a compound
having both mysostatin and insulin-like growth factor moi-
eties, is myogenetic (e.g,, when the binding moiety not only
binds to mysostatin but also substantially reduces the activ-
ity of myostatin upon binding of the binding moiety to
myostatin coupled with the presence of the insulin-like
growth factor). Moreover, co-localization of myostatin (via
a binding moiety) and the insulin-like growth factor moiety
within the same molecule may reduce potential off-target
effects because insulin-like growth factor produces effects
on multiple organ systems.

[0096] CD4 is a surface glycoprotein primarily expressed
on surface of T lymphocytes, such as helper T cells. It is
through the CD4 surface glycoprotein (and a chemokine
receptor such as CCR5 or CXCR4) that human immunode-
ﬁciency virus (HIV) introduces its viral payload to the
T-lymphocyte, ultimately infecting the T-lymphocyte and its
ultimate destructioni Binding moieties (such as the antibody
ibalizumab) targeting CD4 have been described. For
example, anti-CD4 antibodies are described in Reimann et
al. (1997) Aids Res. Human Retrovin 13:933-943, European
Patent Nos. EP 0 512 112, 0 840 618, 0 854 885 and 1 266

national Patent Application Publication Nos. WO
91/009966, WO 97/46697 and WO 01/43779.

[0097] In instances where a binding moiety targeting CD4
is used as the binding moiety within the compounds of the
invention, the overall compound targets T-lymphocytes such
as helper T cells. Thus, when an anti-HIV drug (e.g., an HIV
protease inhibitor, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, a fusion
inhibitor such as enfuvirtide, etc.) is used as the pharmaco-
logically active agent within the compound, the anti-HIV
drug is localized to T-lymphocytes. In instances where the
anti-HIV drug must pass through the cell membrane and
enter the cytoplasm for pharmacologic activity (erg, HIV
protease inhibitor, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, etc.), it is
preferred to have the anti-HIV drug attached via a cleavable
linker. In instances where the anti-HIV drug exerts pharma-
cologic activity at the cell surface (e,g., a fusion inhibitor
such as enfuvirtide), it is preferred to have the anti-HIV drug
attached via a non-cleavable linker. In addition, in those
instances where the binding moiety targeting CD4 also
possesses an independent pharmacological etfect (e.g.,
reduces the ability of the HIV to enter the cell, e.g., an

Jan. 31, 2019

HIV-entry inhibitor), the overall compound can have greater
anti-HIV activity than would be the case of the same binding
moiety targeting CD4 lacking the independent pharmaco-
logical effect.

[0098] CCR5 or “chemokine (C-C motif) receptor" is a G
protein-coupled, seven transmembrane (7-TM) protein
expressed on surface of T cells, macrophages and dendritic
cells. Entry of HIV into a T cell can be eﬁected through
interaction of the CD4 and CCR5 proteins expressed on the
T cell. Upon entry into the T cell, HIV infects the T cell and
ultimately causes the destruction of the T cell. Binding
moieties targeting CCR5 have been described. For example,
anti-CCR5 antibodies are described in Bouhlal et al. (2005)
J. Immunol. 174:7202-7209

[0099] In instances where a binding moiety targeting
CCR5 is used as the binding moiety within the compounds
of the invention, the overall compound targets T cells,
macrophages and dendritic cells. Thus, when an anti-HIV
drug (eg, an HIV protease inhibitor, a ﬁision inhibitor such
as enfuvirtide, etc.) is used as the pharmacologically active
agent within the compound, the anti-HIV drug is localized to
T cells. In instances where the anti-HIV drug must pass
through the cell membrane and enter the cytoplasm for
pharmacologic activity (e.g., HIV protease inhibitor, a
reverse transcriptase inhibitor, etc.), it is preferred to have
the anti-HIV drug attached via a cleavable linken In
instances where the anti-HIV drug exerts pharmacologic
activity at the cell surface (e.g., a fusion inhibitor such as
enfuvirtide), it is preferred to have the anti-HIV drug
attached via a non-cleavable linker. In addition, in those
instances where the binding moiety targeting CCR5 also
possesses an independent pharmacological effect (e.g.,
reduces the ability of the HIV to enter the cell, eg, and
HIV-entry inhibitor), the overall compound can have greater
anti-HIV activity than would be the case of the same binding
moiety targeting CD4 lacking the independent pharmaco-
logical etfect.

[0100] CXCR4 or “CXC chemokine receptor” is a G
protein-coupled, seven transmembrane (7-TM) protein
expressed on surface of T cells, Entry of HIV into a T cell
can be effected through interaction of the CD4 and CXCR4
proteins expressed on the T cell. Upon entry into the T cell,
HIV infects the T cell and ultimately causes the destruction
of the T cell. Binding moieties targeting CXCR4 have been
described. For example, anti-CXCR4 antibodies are
described in Carnec et al. (2005) J Virolog) 79: 1930-1933.

[0101] In instances where a binding moiety targeting
CXCR4 is used as the binding moiety within the compounds
of the invention, the overall compound targets T cells. Thus,
when an anti-HIV drug (e.g., an HIV protease inhibitor, a
fusion inhibitor such as enfuvirtide, etc.) is used as the
pharmacologically active agent within the compound, the
anti-HIV drug is localized to T cells. In instances where the
anti-HIV drug must pass through the cell membrane and
enter the cytoplasm for pharmacologic activity (eg, HIV
protease inhibitor, a reverse transcriptase inhibitor, etc.), it is
preferred to have the anti-HIV drug attached via a cleavable
linker. In instances where the anti-HIV drug exerts pharma-
cologic activity at the cell surface (e,g,, a fusion inhibitor
such as enfuvirtide), it is preferred to have the anti-HIV drug
attached via a non-cleavable linker. In addition, in those
instances where the binding moiety targeting CXCR4 also
possesses an independent pharmacological eﬂect (e.g.,
reduces the ability of the HIV to enter the cell, e.g., and

[0204] Typical PEGylation reaction was carried out as
f0 lows:

[0205] Aﬂibody® stock solution (300 uL) was transferred
to an Eppendorf tube and 232 uL or 210 uL of 20 mM
MES/1 mM EDTA (pH 6.0) buffer was added to the solution
of Aﬂibody® B or Aﬂibody® A, respectively. PEGylation
was initiated by drop-wise addition of 68 pl of PEG stock
so ution to Afﬁbody® B or 90 pL of PEG stock solution to
A ﬁbody® At The reaction mixtures were incubated at room
temperature for 3 hours. The resultant reaction mixture
contained 1 mg/mL peptide and 2.0 mol equivalents of PEG
(with respect to peptide). The reaction yields were deter-
mined by reversed phase HPLC to be over 95% for Aﬂi-
body® B and 85-90% for Aﬂibody® A.

[0206] The PEGylated Aﬁibody® conjugates were puri-
ﬁed from the reaction mixture by cation exchange chroma-
tography using a 5 mL Hi Trap SP Sepharose HP column
(GE Healthcare). The buifers used for puriﬁcation were:
Buffer A: 10 NaOAc, pH 40 and Buffer B: Buﬁer A+1 M
NaCli The PEGylation reaction mixtures were diluted with
4 volumes of bulferA and load onto the column equilibrated
in butfer A. Unbound substances were washed oﬂ the
column with 5 column volumes of buﬁer A. The PEGylated

 

and non-PEGylated aﬂibodys were eluted from the column
using a linear gradient of 0 to 100% B over 10 column
volumes at a ﬂow rate of 5 mL/min.

[0207] Fractions containing PEGylated aﬁibodys were
pooled and concentrated over a reversed phase CG71$
column (5 mm><100 mm) equilibrated with 015% acetic acid.
Aﬁer loading, the column was washed with 0.5% acetic acid
until both the UV absorbance and conductivity baseline
stabilized. The conjugates were eluted with 60% of acetoni-
trile containing 0.5% acetic acid. The fractions containing
pure PEGylated Aﬂibodys were collected and lyophilized.

The lyophilized conjugates were reconstituted in water and
stored frozen at —80° C

[0208] The purity of PEG-Afﬁbody® conjugates was
>95% by RP-HPLC analysis. The mobile phases were: A,
0.09% TFA in water and B, 0.04% TFA in acetonitrile. An
Intrada WP-RP C18 column (3x150 mm) was used with a
ﬂow rate of 015 ml/min and a column temperature of 45° C.
Detection was carried out at 280 nm. The column was
equilibrated with Buffer A and conjugate separation was
achieved using the gradient timetable shown below:

[0149] Other polymeric reagents are available that react
with groups of a binding moiety and or pharmacologically
active agent, For example, if the polymeric reagent is
end-functionalized or “activated” with a hydroxyl group, an
ester linkage can be formed by reacting the hydroxy-termi-
nated polymeric reagent with a carboxylic acid group-
containing binding moiety or pharmacologically active
agent, Moreover, if the polymeric reagent is functionalized
with a thiol group, a thioester linkage will form between the
thiol of the polymeric reagent and the carboxylic acid
group-containing pharmacologically active agent,

[0150] Additional polymeric reagents include those con-
taining a hydrazide moiety. Such hydrazide—containing poly-
meric reagents are also useful for conjugation to any avail-
able carboxyl group of a binding moiety or
pharmacologically active agent, An example of such a
polymeric reagent includes a polymeric reagent having the
following structure:

where POLY is a polymer,

[0151] Polymeric reagents are known that react with thiol
groups (such as in a cysteine residue) of binding moiety and
pharmacologically active agent selected from the group
consisting of small molecule drugs, Nonlimiting examples
of speciﬁc polymeric reagents useful for forming covalent
linkages with available thiol groups include an N-maleim-
idyl polymeric reagent as described in US, Pat, No, 5,739,

[0152] Typically, the weight-average molecular weight of
the water-soluble non-peptidic polymer in the conjugate is
from about 100 Daltons to about 150,000 Daltons, Exem-
plary ranges, however, include weight-average molecular
weights in the range of greater than 5,000 Daltons to about
100,000 Daltons, in the range of from about 6,000 Daltons
to about 90,000 Daltons, in the range of from about 10,000

to about 120,000 Daltons, and in the range of from about
40,000 Daltons to about 120,000 Daltons, In certain embodi-
ments, the weight-average molecular weight of the water-
soluble non-peptidic polymer in the conjugate is from about
2,000 to about 25,000 and in certain embodiments, from
about 4,000 to about 20.000,

sions of the polymer (e,g., a branched 40,000 Dalton water-
soluble polymer comprised of two 20,000 Dalton polymers)
having a total molecular weight of any of the foregoing can
also be used.

[0154] “When used as the polymer, PEGs will typically
comprise a number of (OCH,CH,) monomers [or
(CH,CH,O) monomers, depending on how the PEG is
deﬁned] , As used throughout the description, the number of
repeating units is identiﬁed by the subscript “n” in
“(OCIL12CH2),,.” Thus, the value of (It) typically falls within
one or more of the following ranges: from 2 to about 4000,
from 2 to about 3400, from about 100 to about 2300, from
about 100 to about 2270, from about 136 to about 2050,

909 to about 2730, and from about 1,200 to about 1,900. For
any given polymer in which the molecular weight is known,
it is possible to determine the number of repeating units (i,e.,
“n") by dividing the total weight-average molecular weight
of the polymer by the molecular weight of the repeating

[0155] Although many examples of polymeric reagents
have been described, additional polymeric reagents are
available for forming the compounds described herein.
Thus, the invention is not limited to the compounds formed
from the presently described polymeric regents, Further-
more, the invention is not limited with respect to any speciﬁc
weight average molecular weight as a wide range of molecu-
lar weights are possible,

[0141] In one or more embodiments of compounds of
Formula II, Q1 and Q2, contain at least one heteratom such
as O, or S, or NH, where the atom proximal to R in Q1 and/or
Q2, when taken together with R, typically represents a
residue of an organic radical-containing core of the polyol,
polythiol or polyamine. Generally, the linkers, Ql and Q2,
contain from 1 to about 10 atoms (eg, from 1 to about 5
atoms). The linkers, Q1 and Q2, typically contain a number
of atoms selected from the group consisting of: l, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, or 10. Illustrative linkers include 0, S, iNHi,
7NH4C(O)7 and 7C(O)7NH7.

[0142] The remaining variables in Formula 11 include the
water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer, POLY and the releas-
able linkage-containing spacer moiety, both of which have
already been discussed. With respect to compounds encom-
passed by Fonnula II, however, typical molecular weights
for the water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer (e.g., each
POLY) include: about 200, about 250, about 300, about 400,
about 500, about 600, about 700, about 800, about 900,
about 1,000, about 1,500, about 2,000, about 3,000, about

15,000, about 17,500, about 18,000, about 19,000 and about
20,000 Daltons.

[0143] As previously indicated, the compounds described
herein include binding moiety and an agent selected from
the group consisting of small molecule drugs, toxins and
radioactive substances, The conjugates of any given popu-
lation can be prepared using any technique known to those
of ordinary skill in the art Typically, however, a polymer
having at least two different reactive groups (wherein one is
optionally blocked) is allowed to react with either the
binding moiety or the agent selected from the group con-
sisting of small molecule drugs, toxins and radioactive
substances. Thereafter, the optional blocking group of the
polymer can be removed using known techniques followed
by reaction of the other species (either the antibody moiety
or the agent selected from the group consisting of small
molecule drugs, toxins and radioactive substances, depend-
ing on which species had previously been attached). Con-
veniently, in the context of linear conjugates, linear, hetero-
bifunctional polymeric reagents (wherein each terminus of
the linear polymer has a different reactive group) are known.

[0144] Representative polymeric reagents and methods for
conjugating these polymeric reagents to an active agent or
binding moiety are known in the art and further described in
Zalipsky et al., “Use of Functionalizea' Pub/(Ethylene Glyi
only) for Modiﬁcation of Polypeptides” in Polyethylene
Glycol Chemistry: Biotechnical and Biomedical Applica-
tions, I M. Harris, Plenus Press, New York (1992), and in
Zalipsky (1995)AdvancedDrugReview: 16:157-182. These
reagents may also be available through commercial sources.
These and other polymeric reagents are described in more
detail below,

[0145] The reactive group of the polymeric reagent can be
any group suited to react with the binding moiety and the
pharmacologically active agent. Generally, the reactive
group comprises an electrophilic or nucleophilic group that
allows for covalent attachment of the active agent under
covalent coupling conditions. Examples of such reactive
groups associated with the polymeric reagent include, but

Jan. 31, 2019

are not limited to those selected from the group consisting of
hydroxyl (70H), ester, orthoester, carbonate, acetal, alde-
hyde, aldehyde hydrate, ketone, ketone hydrate, thione,
thione hydrate, hemiketal, sulfur-substituted hemiketal,
ketal, alkenyl, acrylate, methacrylate, acrylamide, sulfone,
amine, hydrazide, lhiol, thiol hydrate, carboxylic acid,
isocyanate, isothiocyanate, maleimide

succinimide,

benzotriazole

vinylsulfone, chloroethylsulfone, dithiopyridine, vinylpyri-
dine, iodoacetamide, epoxide, glyoxals, diones, mesylates,
tosylates, thiosulfonate, tresylate, silane, and protected or
activated forms thereof.

[0146] In certain embodiments, on either the binding
moiety or the pharmacological active agent, the groups
providing covalent attachment points for a reactive group of
a polymeric reagent include amino (in certain embodiments,
a primary amino group), carboxylic acid, and thiol.

[0147] Conventional coupling reactions using known
reaction conditions can be employed in order to conjugate a
polymeric reagent to the binding moiety and the pharmaco-
logical agent. Such reactions and conditions are explained in
the relevant literature as well as in many of the articles,
patents, and patent publications cited herein.

[0148] Typical of one approach is a reductive amination
reaction used, for example, to conjugate primary amines
with a polymer functionalized with a ketone or aldehyde. In
this approach, the primary amine of a binding moiety or or
pharmacologically active agent reacts with the carbonyl
group of the aldehyde or ketone, thereby forming a Schiﬁ'
base. The SchiE base, in turn, can then be reductively
converted in the presence of sodium borohydride to form a
stable conjugate. At lower pHs, selective reactions at the
N-terminus are possible.

[0195] The compounds for use in connection with the
invention described herein will typically possess a measur-
able degree of bioactivity. For instance, such compounds are
typically characterized as having a bioactivity satisfying one
or more of the following percentages relative to that of the
unconjugated pharmacologically active agent: at least about
2%, at least about 5%, at least about 10%, at least about
15%, at least about 25%, at least about 30%, at least about
40%, at least about 50%, at least about 60%, at least about
80%, at least about 85%, at least about 90%, at least about
95%, at least about 97%, at least about 100%, and more than
105% (when measured in a suitable model, such as those
well known in the art).

[0196] The bioactivity of the compounds disclosed herein
can be determined by methods known to one of skill in the
art. For example, the compounds may be analyzed using
methods that are known to measure the bioactivity of the
unconjugated pharmacologically active agent. As a non-
limiting example, the bioactivity of compounds of the pres-
ent invention where the pharmacologically active agent is an
anti-cancer agent may be analyzed in an appropriate tumor
xenograﬁ model. Further, the model used may also depend
on the particular binding agent used. For example, in
embodiments where the binding agent is a HER2 Aﬁibody®
and the pharmacologically active agent is an anti-cancer
agent, the compounds may be analyzed in a tumor xenograft
model, where the tumor cells are of the type that overex-
presses the HER2 receptor. Regardless of the binding moi-
ety, in certain embodiments the compounds may be tested in
a model where the target of the binding moiety is expressed.

[0197] The ability of the compounds of the present inven-
tion to bind to the target of the binding moiety may be
assessed by methods known to one of skill in the art. For
example, the compound may include a labeling agent either
in addition to or in place of the pharmacologically active
agent and the localization of the compounds may be ana-
lyzed in vivo Additionally, in vitro binding may be analyzed
by methods known in the art. Additional methods are
described in the Examples below. In View of the above,
compounds of the present invention wherein the pharmaco-
logically active agent is replaced with a labeling agent are
also within the scope of the disclosure.

[0198] It is to be understood that while the invention has
been described in conjunction with the speciﬁc embodi-
ments thereof, that the foregoing description as well as the
experimental that follow are intended to illustrate and not
limit the scope of the invention. Other aspects, advantages
and modiﬁcations within the scope of the invention will be
apparent to those skilled in the art to which the invention
pertains. All articles, books, patents, patent publications and
other publications referenced herein are hereby incorporated

EXPERIMENTAL

[0199] The practice of the invention will employ, unless
otherwise indicated, conventional techniques of organic
synthesis and the like, which are understood by one of
ordinary skill in the art and are explained in the literature In
the following examples, efforts have been made to ensure
accuracy with respect to numbers used (e.g., amounts,
temperatures, and so forth), but some experimental error and
deviation should be accounted for

Preparation of PEGylated Aﬁibody® Molecules

[0200] PEGylated Aﬁibody® molecules were prepared as
according to the following procedure.

A. Reduction of Aﬂibody® Molecules

[0201] Aﬁibodys were purchased from Afﬁbody AB. Two
different HER2 Aﬂibodys were purchased, which are des-
ignated Aﬁibody A and Afﬁbody B1 Aﬁibody stock solution
(800 of a 5 mg/mL solution of Aﬁibody A or Aﬂibody B) in
water, 80 uL of l M DTT (Dithiothreitol), 200 [LL of l M
HEPES (pH 7.4) and 2.92 mL water were mixed in a 15 mL
polypropylene conical tube. The reaction mixture was incu-
bated at 37° C. for l houn The reactions were diluted 1:5
with 10 mM NaOAc, pH 4.0, and the excess of DTT was
removed by cation exchange chromatography (5 mL HiTrap
SP Sepharose HP column, GE Healthcare) BufferA was 10
mM NaOAc, pH 4.0, and Buffer B was 10 mM NaOAc, 1
M NaCl, pH 4.0. After loading, the column was washed in
buifer A for 3 column volumes and the reduced aﬁibodys
were eluted using a linear gradient of 0 to 100% B in 10
column volumes at a ﬂow rate of 5 mL/min.

[0202] Fractions containing Afﬁbodys were pooled and
concentrated over a reversed phase CG7IS column (5
mm><100 mm) equilibrated with 0.5% acetic acid. After
loading, the column was washed with 0.5% acetic acid until
both the UV absorbahce and conductivity baseline stabi-
lized. The Aﬂibody® proteins were eluted with 60% of
acetonitrile containing 0.5% acetic acid. The fractions con-
taining pure afﬁbodys were collected, lyophilized and stored
at -80 ° C.

B. PEGylation of Aﬂibody® Molecules

[0203] Stock solutions of 2 mg/mL (286 pM) reduced
Afﬁbody® B and 2 mg/mL (303 pM) reduced Aﬂibody® A
were prepared in 20 mM MES/l mM EDTA (pH 6.0). A2.5
mM stock solution of each PEG reagent (20 kD rnPEG-ru-
MAL, 40 kD rnPEG-ru-MAL, 5 kD mPEG-MAL, 20 kD
mPEG-MAL, 30 kD mPEG-MAL and Cy5.5-20 kD PEG-
MAL) was made in the same buffer used to dissolve the
Aﬁibodys. Structures of the PEG reagents are depicted
below The values adjacent to the repeating ethylene oxide
units, when listed as a kD value, refer to the average
molecular weight of the repeating unit, as opposed to the
number of ethylene oxide units.

mixture was stirred for 1 hour and then the ice-bath was
removed. The reaction was allowed to continue overnight.
The reaction solution was concentrated to remove 2/3 of the
DCM and then transferred slowly into 100 mL of isopropyl
alcohol/ethyl ether (1:1) under stirring. A white solid was
collected and washed with ethyl ether. The precipitation was
repeated once. 1.44 g product (3) (yield, 92%) was obtained

Afﬂbody A—MAL»20kD PBS-BA-docetaxel

[0232] Stock solution of 2 mg/mL (303 uM) reduced
Aﬂibody A was prepared in 20 mM MES/1 mM EDTA (pH
6.0). A 1 niM stock solution of MAL-20 Kd PEG-BA-
docetaxel was made in the same buffer used to dissolve the
Afﬁbody A. The Afﬁbody A stock solution (108 mL) was
transferred to a 50 mL centrifuge tube containing 2.6 mL of
20 mM MES/1 mM EDTA (pH 6.0) buﬁer. Drop-wise
addition of 8.2 mL of MAL-20 Kd PEG-BA-docetaxel stock
solution to the Aﬂibody A solution followed. The reaction
mixtures were incubated at room temperature for 2 hours.
The resultant reaction mixture contained 1 mg/InL peptide
and 2.5 mol equivalents of MAL-20 Kd PEG-BA-docetaxel.
[0233] The Aﬁibody A-MAL-20 kD PEG-BA-docetaxel
conjugate was puriﬁed from the reaction mixture by cation
exchange chromatography using SP-HP Sepharose (GE
Healthcare) packed into a XK26 column (2.6x15 cm). The
buifers used for puriﬁcation were: BufferA: 10 mM NaOAc,
pH 4.0 and Buffer B: Buffer A+1 M NaCl. The reaction
mixture was diluted with 10 volumes of bulfer A and loaded
onto the column equilibrated in buffer A. Unbound sub-
stances were washed off the column with 5 column volumes
of bulfer A. The product and free Alhbody A were eluted
from the column using a linear gradient of 0 to 100% B over
10 column volumes at a ﬂow rate of 8 mL/min.

[0234] Fractions containing Aﬁibody A-MAL-20 kD
PEG-BA-docetaxel were pooled and concentrated over a
reversed phase CG71$ (Amberchrom) column (1.5x19 cm)
equilibrated with 0.5% acetic acid. After loading, the col-
umn was washed with 0.5% acetic acid until both the UV
absorbance and conductivity baseline stabilized. The Afﬁ-
body A-MAL-20 kD PEG-BA-docetaxel was eluted with
60% of acetonitrile containing 0.5% acetic acid. The frac-
tions containing Aﬂibody A-MAL-ZO kD PEG-BA-doc-
etaxel were collected and lyophilized. The lyophilized con-
jugates were reconstituted in 10 mM NaOAc (pH 4.0)/150
mM NaCl and stored frozen at —80° C.

[0235] The purity of Afﬁbody A-MAL-20 kD PEG-BA-
docetaxel conjugate was 99% by RP-HPLC analysis. The

[0117] In certain embodiments, the pharrnacologically
active agent is an auristatin, including analogs and deriva-
tives thereof In certain embodiments the auristatin is
auristatin E, monomethyl auristatin E, auristatin PE, and
monomethyl auristatin F.

[0118] In certain embodiments, the phannacologically
active agent is an epitholone including epitholoines A, B, C,
D, E, and F, including analoges and derivatives thereof.

[0119] In certain embodiments, the pharmacologically
active agent is a maytansinoid. In certain embodiments the
pharmacologically active agent is DMI.

[0120] One of skill in the art may select the pharmaco-
logically active agent based on the particular binding agent
used. For example, in certain embodiments, an Aﬁibody®
molecule that targets the HER2 receptor may be used. As
such, the pharmacologically active agent may be chosen
from one that may treat the underlying condition associated
with HER2 overexpression, In certain embodiments the
pharmacologically active agent is selected from a compound
used for the treatment of breast cancer, ovarian cancer,
pancreatic cancer, stomach cancer, salivary cancer, lung
cancer, and esophageal cancer. In certain embodiments the

Jan. 3], 2019

phannacologically active agent is chosen from docetaxel,
paclitaxel, anthracylcin, topotecan, gemcitabine and lapa-
tinib.

[0121] The above exemplary agents are meant to encom-
pass, where applicable, analogues, agonists, antagonists,
inhibitors, isomers, and polymorphs.

[0122] With respect to the water-soluble, non-peptidic
polymer, any polymer can be used so long as the polymer is
non-antigenic and non-immunogenic. In certain embodi-
ments, when the active agents (e.g. proteins) are relatively
large, the polymer in the conjugate is water soluble. With
respect to relatively small active agents (e,g. nonpeptidic
active agents), the polymer in the conjugate can be either
water soluble or not. With regard to the polymer associated
with conjugates, however, the polymer is typically non-
peptidic, In certain embodiments the polymer is a poly
(ethylene glycol). In certain embodiments, a polymer suited
for use herein can be, for example, other water-soluble
poly(alkylene glycols), copolymers of ethylene glycol and
propylene glycol and the like, poly(oleﬁnic alcohol), poly
(vinylpyrrolidone), poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylamide),
poly(hydroxyalkylmethacrylate), poly(saccharides), poly(a-
hydroxy acid), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyphosphazene, poly-
oxazoline (which are described in WO 2008/106186), poly
(N -acryloylmorpholine), such as described in US. Pat. No.
5,629,384, and copolymers, terpolymers, nonrandom block,
and random block polymers of any of the foregoing,
[0123] The water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer is not
limited to a particular structure and can be linear (e.g., an
end capped, e,g., alkoxy PEG or a bifunctional PEG),
branched or multi-armed (e.g., forked PEG or PEG attached
to a polyol core), a dendritic (or star) architecture, each with
or without one or more linkages In certain embodiments the
linkages may be degradable, Moreover, the internal structure
of the water-soluble polymer can be organized in any
number of ditferent repeat patterns and can be selected from
the group consisting of homopolymer, alternating copoly-
mer, random copolymer, block copolymer, alternating trip-
olymer, random tripolymer, and block tripolymer In the
context of being present within an overall structure, a
water-soluble polymer segment has from I to about 300
termini.

[0124] In addition to the above-described forms of the
polymer, the polymer can also have one or more weak or
degradable linkages in the polymer, For example, poly
(ethylene glycol) (“PEG”) can be prepared with ester link-
ages in the polymer that are subject to hydrolysis. As shown
below, this hydrolysis results in cleavage of the polymer into
fragments of lower molecular weight:

7PEG-CoziPECH-HZOaiPEG»COZH+H07
PEG-

[0125] Other hydrolytically degradable linkages, useful as
a degradable linkage within the polymer, include carbonate
linkages; imine linkages resulting, for example, from reac-
tion of an amine and an aldehyde (see, e,g,, Ouchi et al.
(1997) Polymer Preprints 38(1):582-3); phosphate ester
linkages formed, for example, by reacting an alcohol with a
phosphate group; hydrazone linkages which are typically
formed by reaction of a hydrazide and an aldehyde; acetal
linkages that are typically formed by reaction between an
aldehyde and an alcohol; ortho ester linkages that are, for
example, formed by reaction between a formate and an
alcohol; amide linkages formed by an amine group, e.g., at
an end of a polymer such as PEG, and a carboxyl group of

Determination of Stability of Conjugates in Tissue
Culture Growth Medium

[0238] To assess the stability of the conjugates described
in Example 6 in complete tissue culture growth medium at
physiological pH (pH:7.4), and pH 6.5, the conjugates were
diluted to a ﬁnal concentration of 25 pM in complete growth
medium (RPMI-l640 containing 2mM glutamine and 10%
fetal bovine serum) pH to 7,4 and pH 6.5 (100 pL of HCl was
added to 250 mL of the same complete growth medium to
bring pH to 65). Each test condition was done in duplicate
in a low protein binding 96-well block. Zero hour time point
samples were immediately harvested and processed,
Remaining samples were incubated in a 37° C,, 5% C02
incubator for 48 and 72 hrs, and harvested at each time point.
[0239] At 0, 48 and 72 hr time points, 3 “L 2:1 PMSF (50
mM in DMSO)/Glacia1 Acetic Acid was added to 100 uL of
media containing 25 11M of test articles and then placed in
a —80° C. freezer for storage.

[0240] To analyze the samples, the samples were thawed.
To the thawed samples, 100 [LL of sample processing buifer
(1:2, 1M Potassium Phosphate Monobasic/ 1M Potassium
Phosphate Dibasic) and 20 [LL of paclitaxel internal standard
(125 ng/mL in DMSO) were added and mixed by vortexing,
150 [LL of each sample was transferred into separate 15 mL
conical tubes containing 4 mL of methyl tert-butylether,
capped, and vortexed for 5-10 seconds, centrifuged at 4000
RPM for 5 minutes at 4° C. and ﬂash frozen in a —80° C.
freezer for 15 minutes, The supernatant was decanted into
clean 15 mL conical tubes and evaporated to dryness under
a stream of nitrogen gas using a TurboVap set at 50° C,
Samples were then reconstituted with a 45:55 mixture of 10
mM Anunonium Acetate (+01% formic acid)/Acetonitrile,

Plasma Stability Testing

[0241] The rate of release of docetaxel from Aﬂibody
A-MAL-2 kD PEG-docetaxel (Example 6) and Aﬂibody
A-MAL-20 kD PEG-docetaxel (Example 6) was studied in

mouse plasma and in pH 7.4 100 mM potassium phosphate
buifer,

[0242] Aﬁibody A-MAL-2 kD PEG-docetaxel (Example
6) and Aﬂibody A-MAL-20 kD PEG-docetaxel (Example 6)
were provided at stock concentrations of 1880 and 1840 pM
respectively in solution with 10 mM sodium acetate and 150
sodium chloride at a pH of 4.0.

[0243] Mouse plasma and potassium phosphate buffer
were pre-incubated for one hour in a 5% C02 water saturated
atmosphere at a temperature of 37° C. In triplicate, the test
article stock solutions were spiked into wells of a 96-well
plate containing the pre-incubated plasma or buffer to give
a ﬁnal test article concentration of 5 HM and a ﬁnal volume
of 1 mL. The 96-well plate was then vortexed for 10 seconds
and then placed in an incubator with a 5% CO2 water
saturated atmosphere set at a temperature of 37° C. At 5, 15,
30 minute and 1, 2, 4, 6 and 24 hour time points, 100 [LL of
solution from each incubation well was quenched by with-
drawal and placement into a separate 96-well plate contain-
ing 3 pL of (2:1) phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride (50 mM in
dimethyl sulfoxide)/glacial acetic acid and then vortexed for
10 seconds.

[0244] For zero minute samples, the mouse plasma and
potassium phosphate butfer were pre-treated with the (2:1)
phenylmethanesulfonyl ﬂuoride (50 mM in dimethyl sul-
foxide)/glacial acetic acid quench solution prior to the
addition of test articles, Upon test article addition to give a
ﬁnal test article concentration of5 11M and a ﬁnal volume of
1 mL the samples were vortexed for 10 seconds to mix,

[0245] All samples were processed by Liquid-Liquid-
Extraction and then submitted for [C/MS/MS analysis. Rate
of release of docetaxel was determined by linear regression
and reported in Table 5.

Prophetic Preparation of Ab-X’-POLY—X2-Dr

[0224] A compound of the general formula “Ab-X‘-
POLY—XZ-Dr” having physiologically cleavable (i.e,,
relwseable) linkages is prepared, This example has only
stable linkages,

[0225] The Ab-Xl-POLY-XZ-Dr construct is produced in a
conjugation reaction with a binding moiety (iier, Aﬁibody)
(“Ab”) and a homo- or hetero-bifunctional polymeric
reagent containing a reactive group on both ends, rGrl-Poly-
rGi}. A hetero-bifunctional polymeric reagent that can be
utilized if the binding moiety (“Ab”) contains a thiol group
is an alpha-succinimidyl, omega-maleimidyl, polyethyl-
eneglycol, “NHS-PEG-MAL” (See, for example, US. Pat,
Nos, 6,448,369 and 6,602,498) in which the succinimidyl
group (corresponding, in this instance, to “rG1”) reacts with
an amine group on the phannacologically active agent
(“Dr”). The reaction between the polymeric reagent “NHS-
PEG-MAL" and Dr is performed with a 5-fold molar excess
of NHS-PEG-MAL over Dr at pH 7.4 for six hours at 37° C,
The size of the polymeric component should be less than
2,000 Da if close proximity of the binding protein and
pharmacologically active agent is desired The polymeric
component should be at least 20,000 Da if a construct larger
than the renal ﬁltration size limit is desired, The resulting

 

Jan. 3], 2019

intermediate corresponds to “rCrrz-POIY-XZ-Dr’i Addition-
ally, the reagent NHS-Xz-PEG-MAL, may be used in a
similar manner

[0226] The rGrz-POLY-XZ-Dr construct containing the
maleimidyl functional group (MAL-POLY—XZ-Dr) can then
be reacted with the binding moiety (“Ab”) containing the
thiol group to produce the ﬁnal product, Abl-Xl-POLY-Xz-
DL The reaction is performed with a 2-fold molar excess of
the binding moiety (“Ab”) over rGrz-POLY-XZ-Dr at pH 6.0.

Determination of Aﬁinity for HER-2 Receptor of
Aﬂibody® Conjugates

[0210] Equipment: ProteOn XPR36 (BioRad)

[0211] Materials: GLM sensor chips were from BioRad.
Anti-human mAb from Invitrogen (Cat. Number H10500).
RhErbBZ/Fc was from R&D Systems (Cat. Number 1129-
ER).

[0212] A new GLM sensor chip was docked and the
system primed with hepes buﬁered saline (HBS). Anti-
human mAb was amine coupled using sulfo-NHS/EDC
activation for 5 minutes followed by an injection of anti-
human mAb at 10 ug/ml in 10 mM NaOAc (pH 5.0).
Surfaces were then blocked with 1 M ethanolamine pH 8.5.
This resulted in the coupling of ~8,500 RU of mAb onto the
surface.

[0213] 50 ug of rhErbBZ/Fc was dissolved into 250 of
HBS-p with 0.1 mg/ml BSA. The receptor was then diluted
to 2, 0.6, 0.2, 0.07, and 0.024 ug/ml and captured for 5
minutes over the anti-Fc surface. Capture levels ranged from
900, 500, 300, 100 to 50 RU.

[0214] Samples were each tested at 100 nM as the highest
concentration in a 3-fold dilution series. The response data

from each diﬂerent density receptor surface were globally
ﬁtted to determine the rate constants summarized in Table 1.

[0220] To assess localization of anti-HER2 Aﬂibody®
conjugates to tumors, SKOV—3 tumor cells, which express
high levels of HER2 protein, were injected subcutaneously
into the ﬂank regions of athymic, nude mice at 5><106
cells/100 ul for each ﬂank. Female athymic nude mice
(Hsd:Athymic Nude-Foxn lnu) were obtained from Harlan
Laboratory and housed in testing facility for at least 3 days

HIV-entry inhibitor), the overall compound can have greater
anti-HIV activity than would be the case of the same binding
moiety targeting CXCR4 lacking the independent pharma-
cological effect.

[0102] Interleukin-l receptor is a cell surface receptor
expressed on the surface of insulin-producing pancreatic
beta cells (among other cell types). The endogenous cytok-
ines of interleukin-1 and interleukin-1 receptor antagonist
effectively compete to bind to interleukin<l receptors
expressed on pancreatic beta cells; normal and healthy
insulin production occurs when interleukin-1 and interleu-
kin-l receptor antagonists are in the proper balance. Because
interleukin-1 receptor antagonist appears to protect against
glucose-induced functional impairment and apoptosis of
insulin-producing pancreatic beta cells, a decrease in inter-
leukin-l receptor antagonist can result in the insufﬁcient
production of insulin, thereby leading to hyperglycemia and,
ultimately, diabetes. Binding moieties targeting interleu-
kin-l receptor could be useful for incorporation in the
described compounds.

[0103] In instances where a binding moiety targeting
interleukin-1 receptor is used as the binding moiety within
the compounds of the invention, the overall compound
targets pancreatic beta cells. Thus, when an insulin secre-
tion-promoting drug (e.g., a sulfonylurea such as acetohex-
amide, chlorpropamide, tolazimide, tolbutamide, gliclazide,
glipizide, glyburide and glimeperide) is used as the phar-
macologically active agent within the compound, the insulin
secretion-promoting dnig is localized to insulin-producing
beta cells,

[0104] Tumor markers include non-endogenous antigenic
proteins expressed by cancer cells as well as endogenous
proteins over-expressed by cancer cells. Binding moieties
(such as the antibody trastnzumab) targeting tumor markers
have been described. See Spiridon et al., (200) Clinical
Cancer Research 8(6): 1720-1730.

[0105] In instances where a binding moiety targeting a
tumor marker is used as the binding moiety within the
compounds of the invention, the overall compound targets
cancer cells. Thus, when an anticancer drug (e.g., a taxane)
is used as the pharmacologically active agent within the
compound, the anticancer drug is localized to a cancer.
[0106] Efflux transporters (e,g., PgP, MRP2, and BCRP)
are expressed at the apical surface of epithelial cells and
brain endothelial cells. These proteins effectively serve as
transcompartmental “pumps” to remove foreign or other-
wise undesired moieties outside of the compartment into
which they passed. Such transporters serve, for example, as
a means to eliminate or reduce the ability of pharmacologi-
cally active agents to remain in the central nervous system.
Binding moieties (such as the antibody UIC2) targeting an
eﬂlnx transporter have been described.

[0107] In instances where a binding moiety targeting an
eﬂlnx transporter is used as the binding moiety within the
compounds of the invention, the overall compound targets
eﬂlux transporters, and preferably decreases or eliminates
entirely their eﬁlux action. Thus, a pharmacologically active
agent within the compound is localized to the eﬂlux trans-
porter For example, when a pharmacologically active agent
is desired to enter and remain in the central nervous system
(i.e., a “CNS drug,” such as a neuroleptic, sedative hypnotic,
analgesic, antipyschotic, antiviral and cytotoxic), a com-
pound of the invention in which the pharmacologically
active agent is a CNS drug and the binding moiety targets an

Jan. 3], 2019

eﬂlux transporter (and preferably decreases or eliminates
entirely the eﬂlux action of the eﬂlux transporter), the CNS
drug localizes at the efﬂux transporter. In an embodiment of
this particular approach, the linkage near the CNS drug and
the remaining compound is cleavable in vivo so as to allow
for entry of the CNS drug into the cell.

[0108] Produced by plasma cells located in lymph nodes,
IgE antibodies represent a class of immunoglobulins
involved in the propagation of an allergic response. Follow-
ing the release of allergen-speciﬁc IgE antibodies from the
plasma cells upon a ﬁrst encounter with the allergen, the Fc
portion IgE of the IgE antibodies bind to Fc receptors on
mast cells. If the allergen comes into contact with the IgE
antibody now attached to the mast cell, the mast cells
releases histamine and other cytokines, thereby triggering an
immune response, Binding moieties targeting Fc receptors
or IgE bound to Fc receptors (such as the antibody omali-
zumab, which has some binding aﬂinity to IgE bound Fc
receptors), are known.

[0109] In instances where a binding moiety targeting FccR
(a class of receptors associated with mast cells and baso-
phils) is used as the binding moiety within the compounds
of the invention, the overall compound targets mast cells and
basophils, Thus, when an anti-allergy dmg (e.g,, cromolyn,
antihistamines, pseudoephedrine, etc.) is used as the phar-
macologically active agent within the compound, the anti-
allergy drug is localized to mast cells and basophils.

include, without limitation: IGFR, folate receptor alpha,

As recited above, when the binding moiety within the
compounds of the present invention targets one of the above
receptor/protein, the overall compound targets that receptor/
protein. In certain embodiments, the pharmacologically
active agent will be selected from an agent that is known to
treat the disease or diseases associated with the expression
of the particular target receptor/protein.

any active agent can be used and the invention is not limited
in this regard. Suitable agents can be selected from, for

The Antitumor Activity of HER2 (c-erbB2)
Targeted PEGylated Docetaxel in N87 (HER2

Overexpressing Gastric Carcinoma) Xenograﬂs in
Female SCID Mice

[0250] The objective of this study was to evaluate the
antiturnor activity of a single administration of anti-HER2
targeted PEG-conjugated docetaxel on N87 gastric carci-
noma xenografts in female SCID mice.

[0251] Animal Husbandry: Female C.B.—17 SCID mice
(5-6 weeks old), purchased from Charles River Laboratories
were used for this study. Upon arrival, the mice were housed
in ventilated polycarbonate cages with sterile bedding at ﬁve
animals per cage and acclimated for a minimum of three
days. The cages were identiﬁed by cage labels or tags.
Sterilized (autoclaved or irradiated) water and commercial
rodent diet were supplied ad libitum. Cages, bedding and
water bottles were changed at least once a week and food
was replenished as needed. The animals were maintained at
a temperature

[0252] of 65-72° F, and a relative humidity of 30-70% in
a room with a 12 hour lighddark cycle.

[0253] Tumor Cell Preparation: All handling and prepa-
ration of cells were conducted in a biosafety cabinet or
sterility and safety. N87, gastric carcinoma cells from tie
N'EKTAR liquid nitrogen freezers were used for this stucy.
The cells were grown in sterile tissue culture ﬂasks with
RPM] 1640 media containing 10% Fetal Bovine Serum
(FBS) until 85% conﬂuence. To prepare for implantation, tie
cells in the ﬂasks were rinsed brieﬂy with an appropriate
amount of 0.25% trypsin solution. The rinsate was removed
and replaced with 2 to 3 mL of fresh 0.25% trypsin solution.
The ﬂasks were then placed in a 37'C incubator for 5
minutes. When the cells dissociated, an appropriate amount
of complete growth media was added to neutralize t‘le
trypsin, The suspension was centrifuged at 1000 rpm for 0
minutes after which the supernatant was discarded. The ce ls
were washed by resuspending the pellet in an appropriate
volume of serum free media. A sample was removed or
counting and the rest of the suspension was again centri-
fuged at 1000 rpm for 10 minutes. After centrifugation, tie
supernatant was discarded and the cell pellet resuspended in
serum free media at an appropriate volume determined y
the cell count.

[0254] Tumor Cell Implantation: All handling of animals
and procedures were done in a biosafety cabinet. Tie
animals’ ﬂanks were shaved prior to the day of implantation.
The mice were anesthetized via isoﬂurane inhalation, when
in proper anesthetic plane; the ﬂanks were wiped with 70%
isopropanol followed by implantation of the NCI N87 ce ls
at l><107 cells/site in 0.2 mL volume (in 50% Matrigel®)
injected subcutaneous on the right ﬂank of the animals. Tie
animals were distributed accordingly based on the random-
ization generated by the StudyLog® software.

 

 

[0255] Treatment Groups: There were 5 groups with 8 to
10 animals each. Included were vehicle (Saline), Docetaxel
at 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, Aﬂibody A-linear 2 kD PEG-
docetaxel 10 mg/kg (Example 6) (Docetaxel concentration)
and Aﬂibody A-linear 20 kD PEG-docetaxel at 10 mg/kg
(Example 6) (Docetaxel concentration) respectively.

[0256] Treatment Administration: The animals were dis-
tributed based on the randomization generated by the Study-
Log® software. The mean tumor volumes on treatment day
(Day 0) ranged from 209:8 mm3 to 239:15 mm3
(MeanISEM). All test articles were diluted in sterile saline
to the appropriate concentration and were administered as
single dose to the appropriate treatment group via intrave-
nous injection (i.v.). Animals were warmed in clear acrylic
hotboxes to facilitate venous dilation. While in the hotboxes,
the animals were closely observed for signs of overheating
and distress. When the animals were amply warmed, they
were removed from the hotboxes and transferred into appro-
priate mouse restrainers. The tails were wiped with alcohol
pads and the test article in a syringe with a 27 gauge needle
was injected into the lateral tail vein. Maximum treatment
volume for the i.v. injections will not exceed 20 mL/kg.

[0257] Tumor Measurements and Body Weights: Tumors
size was monitored at least twice weekly. Dimensions
(length and the width) were measured using digital calipers,
Tumor volume was computed using the formula:

Volume:Lx WQ/Z.

Where: L:length of the tumor in millimeters and Wavidth
of the tumor in millimeters

Tumor growth on each animal was monitored to a maximum
volume of 2000 mm? Animals were weighed prior to
implantation and at least twice weekly for the duration of the
study.

[0258] Results: The smallest and largest tumor volumes
for each group, as well as tumor volumes on treatment day
and study termination are summarized in Table 8. Tumors
with ﬁnal volumes that are greater than its initial volume but
less than that of the mean ﬁnal volume of the vehicle control

group were classiﬁed to be in a state of inhibition in Table
8.

In Vitro Cytotoxic Activity

[0246] To assess cytotoxic activity of the conjugates of
Example 7 (Afﬁbody A-MAL—2 kD PEG-docetaxel and
Afﬁbody A-MAL-20 kD PEG-docetaxel) cytotoxicity
assays were performed in two types of Her2 positive cell
lines, NCI-N87, and SKOV—S. The conjugates were also
tested in a Her2 negative cell line, SK-N—SK as an experi-
mental control. Serial dilutions of the conjugates and control
compound were prepared Cells were lifted from the ﬂask
using 2 mL of trypsin for 5 min, neutralized with 8 mL of
complete growth medium, and centrifuged at 1200 rpm for
5 min. The supernatant was aspirated and the cell pellet was
washed with PBS, centrifuged, then resuspended in com-
plete growth medium (McCoy’s for SKOV3 and RPMI-
1640 for N87 and SK-N—SH, supplemented with 10% heat
inactivated FBS), pH 6.5. Cells were counted, diluted, and
then plated in white, clear bottom 96-well plates at a density
of 20,000 cells/well, then followed immediately by addition
of conjugates and control compound. Cells were incubated
with the test articles for 48 hours in a 37° C., 5% CO2
incubator, and then analyzed for cytotoxic activity using
Promega CytoTox-Glo chemiluminescent reagent
(Cat#G9291). Signal was quantiﬁed with a Perkin Elmer
TopCount plate reader, and the data was analyzed using the
GraphPad Prism software EC50 values for each cell line are
reported in Table 6. FIGS. 4, 5, and 6 are linear regression
graphs for each cell line where mean RLU is plotted vs.

Pharmacokinetic Proﬁles of IRDye800-Labeled
PEG-Afﬁbody A Conjugates in Rats
[0247] Male Sprague—Dawley rats (300-325 g) were

obtained from Harlan Laboratory and housed in testing
facility for 3 days for acclimation. Testing articles
(IRDye800—Aﬂibody A, 2 kD PEG-Aﬁ'tbody A-IRDye800,
IRDye800-20 kD PEG-Afﬁbody A IRDye800 and
IRDye800-(10 kD PEG)2-Afﬁbody A-IRDye800, wherein
the IR dye is attached to the Aﬂibody molecule according to
the procedures provided by the dye manufacturer Li-Cor
Biosciences (Lincoln, Nebraska» were diluted with 0.9%
NaCl and dosed at 10 nmol/kg. The testing compounds were
administered IV through jugular vein catheter. At different
time points after dosing, blood samples were collected
through carotid artery catheter into collection tubes contain-
ing Lithium Heparin. The blood samples were centrifuged at
10000 rpm for 10 minutes under 4 C, and the plasma
supernatant was separated and stored in —65 C freezer.
[0248] At the time of sample analysis, frozen plasma
samples were thawed and 25 ul of plasma for each time point
was pipette into 96-well plate. Additional 100 111 of dilution
buifer was added to each well. The plate was scanned using
Li-Cor Odyssey scanner and the near IR ﬂuorescence signal
in 800 nm channel was obtained. Concentration standard
curve was established by spiking different amount of con-
jugate into normal rat plasma and obtaining their near IR
signal data. The drug concentration in rat plasma was
obtained by comparing with the standard curve.

[0249] The rat PK proﬁle was analyzed by 2-Cornpartrnent
Model using WinNonLin Phoenix 6.2.1 software from Phar-
sight (Mountain View, Calif). The 2-compar'tment IV—bolus
model has 13’ order Elimination Rate, no lag time and used

Provisional Patent Application Ser. No. 61/491,133, ﬁled on

herein by reference in their entireties.

[0002] The present invention relates generally to biologi-
cally active compounds. In addition, the invention relates to
methods for preparing the compounds, pharmaceutical
preparations comprising the compounds, and the like.
[0003] Human Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor 2
(HER2) is a transmembrane receptor that is highly expressed
in a signiﬁcant number of cancers, including breast cancer,
ovarian cancer, and gastric cancer. Overexpression of HER2
is present in about twenty-ﬁve percent of all breast cancer
and is associated with malignant transformation of cells.
HER2 positive breast cancer is generally much more aggres-
sive and has a diminished survival rate compared to breast
cancer without HER2 overexpression. Additionally, overex-
pression ofHERZ in gastric cancer is associated with a poor
prognosis.

[0004] With HER2 overexpression associated with
aggressive forms of cancer, there has been an effort to
develop therapies that work through the HER2 receptor
Trastuzamab (Herceptin®) is one example that has demon-
strated signiﬁcant success in treating HER2 positive cancers.
A humanized monoclonal antibody, trastuzamab targets the
extracellular domain of HER2. While eﬁective in some
patients, not all patients respond to trastuzamab therapy.
Further, some cells develop resistance to monotherapy,
requiring combination with other anticancer drugs, such as
docetaxel, paclitaxel, anthracylcin, and lapatinib.

[0005] Alternatively, given the implications of the over-
expression of HER2, the HER2 receptor is an attractive
target for directed drug delivery systems. Since there is no
natural ligand for HER2, artiﬁcial ligands have been devel-
oped for targeted drug delivery to the HER2 receptor: These
artiﬁcial ligands include antibody, Fab, ScFv, peptide, and
Aﬂibody® molecules that target the HER2 receptor. These
molecules have been used as drug targeting ligands with
varying degrees of success.

[0006] For example, Aﬁibody® (Aﬁibody AB, Stockholm
Sweden) molecules are small (~6 kD), stable proteins based
on a 58 amino acid chain of protein A. The binding pockets
of an Aﬂibody®, which consist of 13 amino acids, may be
optimized to bind to particular targets, one of which is the
HER2 receptor. Afﬁbody® molecules offer advantages over
other ligands, such as antibodies, due to their small size, ease
of synthesis, stability, and reversible folding characteristics.
Further, they have been shown to have high aﬂinity for their
targets. Alexis et al., (2008) Chem. Med. Chem., vol. 3, pp.
1839-43. With respect to HER2, Aﬂibodys have been shown
to selectively bind to HER2 overexpressing cell lines and
HER2 speciﬁc Aﬁibodys have been reportedly used to direct
nanoparticles containing anti-cancer agents to HER2 over-
expressing cells. Alexis et a1. Attempts to use the afﬁnity of
Aﬂibody® molecules as targeting agents has been reported
US Patent Application Publication 2009/0074828.

Jan. 31, 2019

[0007] Beyond directing molecules to cells, conjugates of
a targeting moiety and an active agent are believed to
produce additional beneﬁts. It has been hypothesized that by
increasing delivery of an active agent to a particular cell
while reducing normal tissue exposure, the therapeutic win-
dow of the active agent may be expanded. In such cases, the
maximum tolerated dose may be increased, while the mini-
mum effect dose is decreased. As such, it may be possible to
administer highly cytotoxic drugs that normally are avoided
due to a narrow therapeutic window. As an example, T—DMl
is an antibody-drug conjugate currently being developed by
Immunogen and Genentech. T—DMl is a conjugate of tras-
tuzamab and DM1 which has reportedly shown efﬁcacy in
patients with HER2 metastatic breast cancer. Burris et al.,
(2011) Journal ofClinical Oncology, pp. 398-405. DMl is a
maytansinoid derivative that is highly potent, but is also
considered to be highly toxic. Additionally, antibody-drug
conjugates that include a PEG4Mal linker have been
reported: Kovtun et al:, (2010), vol. 70, pp 2528-2537:
[0008] Although showing promise, there remains a need to
(among other things) provide for targeted delivery of a drug,
toxin or radioactive sub stance to HER2 over expressing cells
and other cell targets. The present invention is believed to
address these and other needs in the art.

Jan. 3], 2019

[0031] It must be noted that, as used in this speciﬁcation
and the intended claims, the singular forms “a ” “an.” and
“the” include plural referents unless the context clearly
dictates otherwise, Thus, for example, reference to “a poly-
mer” includes a single polymer as well as two or more of the
same or diiTerent polymers, reference to “an optional excipi-
ent” refers to a single optional excipient as well as two or
more of the same or diiferent optional excipients, and the
like. In describing and claiming the present invention, the
following terminology will be used in accordance with the
deﬁnitions described below.

[0032] The term “water soluble” as in a “water-soluble
polymer" polymer is any polymer that is soluble in water at
room temperature, Typically, a water-soluble polymer will
transmit at least about 75%, more preferably at least about
95%, of light transmitted by the same solution after ﬁltering,
On a weight basis, a water-soluble polymer will, in certain
embodiments, be at least about 35% (by weight) soluble in
water, in certain embodiments at least about 50% (by
weight) soluble in water, in certain embodiments about 70%
(by weight) soluble in water, and in certain embodiments,
about 85% (by weight) soluble in water. In certain embodi-
ments the water-soluble polymer is about 95% (by weight)
soluble in water or completely soluble in water. “Water
soluble, non-peptidic polymer” encompasses the above,
though with respect to being “non-peptidic,” a polymer is
non-peptidic when it has less than 35% (by weight) of amino
acid residues.

[0033] A “polymer” is a molecule possessing from about
2 to about 4000 or more monomers. Speciﬁc polymers for
use in the invention include those having a variety of
geometries such as linear, branched, or forked, to be
described in greater detail below.

[0034] The terms “monomer,” “monomeric subunit” and
“monomeric unit” are used interchangeably herein and refer
to one of the basic structural units of a polymer or polymer.
In the case of a homo-polymer, a single repeating structural
unit forms the polymer. In the case of a co-polymer, two or
more structural units are repeatedgeither in a pattern or
randomlyito form the polymer, In certain embodiments,
polymers used in connection with present the invention are
homo-polymers. The water-soluble, and the water soluble
non-peptidic polymer typically comprises one or more
monomers serially attached to form a chain of monomers,
The polymer can be formed from a single monomer type
(ie, is homo-polymeric) or two or three monomer types
(i.e,, is co-polymeric).

[0035] “PEG,” “polyethylene glycol” and “poly(ethylene
glycol)” as used herein, are interchangeable and encompass
any nonpeptidic water-soluble poly(ethylene oxide). Typi-
cally, PEGs for use in accordance with the invention com-
prise the following structure “7(OCH2CH2)"7" where (n)
is 2 to 4000, As used herein, PEG also includes
“ACHZCHZAO(CHZCHZ0),,4CHzCH27” and
“7(OCH2CH2)"O~,” depending upon Whether or not the
terminal oxygens have been displaced, e.g., during a syn-
thetic transformation. Throughout the speciﬁcation and
claims, it should be remembered that the term “PEG"
includes structures having various terminal or “end capping"
groups and so forth The term “PEG” also means a polymer
that contains a majority, that is to say, greater than 50%, of
AOCHZCHzi repeating subunits, With respect to speciﬁc
forms, the PEG can take any number of a variety of
molecular weights, as well as structures or geometries such
US 2019/0030182 A1

[0077] In certain embodiments, the compound is a com-
pound of the formula

S-Affibody.

[0078] In certain embodiments, each POLY is selected
from the group consisting of poly(alkylene oxide), poly
(vinyl pyrrolidone), poly(vinyl alcohol), polyoxazoline, and
poly(acryloylmorpholine). In certain embodiments POLY is
a poly(alkylene oxide). In cemin embodiments, POLY is
poly(ethylene glycol). In certain embodiments the weight-
average molecular weight of the water-soluble non-peptidic
polymer in the compound is from about 100 Daltons to about
150,000 Daltons. In certain embodiments, the weight-aver-
age molecular weight of the water-soluble non-peptidic
polymer in the compound is from about 2,000 to about
25,000, In certain embodiments, the the weight-average
molecular weight of the water-soluble non-peptidic polymer
in the compound is from about 4,000 to about 20,000.

[0079] In certain embodiments, the compound is selected
from a compound of the formula

0 O

D,_OJI\/\/(0CH2CH2),,—OCHZCHZ\N

o
SrAi‘ﬁbody.

wherein Dr is as deﬁned herein and n is an integer from 2 to
4000. In certain embodiments, n is an integer from 2 to 2000.
In certain embodiments, n is an integer from 2 to 1000. In
certain embodiments, n is an integer from 20 to 1000, In
certain embodiments, wherein n is an integer from 30 to 500.
In certain embodiments, n is an integer from 45 to 460.

[0080] Wltile not being bound to any one theory, it is
believed that the compounds disclosed herein will provide
for the targeted delivery of pharmacologically active agents.
The compounds are expected to have a longer half-life than
the parent binding moiety. Further, by nature of the targeted
delivery, it may be possible to lower the dose of the
pharmacologically active agent administered to the patient,
thereby lowering the risk of harmful side effects. Addition-
ally, the compounds may also be able to deliver a larger
amount of the pharmacologically active agent to speciﬁc
targets, thereby providing a larger effective dose to the
target, By increasing the dose of drug received at the target
site while reducing the amount of drug in non-targeted
tissue, the therapeutic window of the phamtacologically
active agent may be increased. This effect may allow for the
delivery of highly potent pharmacologically active agents
whose use is normally limited due to their side effect
proﬁles,

[0081] As will be appreciated by one of skill in the art, the
various aspects of the presently disclosed compounds may

Jan. 31, 2019

be varied in order to achieve or vary a property of the
compounds. Such variables include but are not limited to,
for example, the size of the polymer, the shape of the
polymer, the aﬂinity of the binding moiety, the activity/
potency of the pharmacologically active agent, and the
cleavage properties of the linkers. For example, the
enhanced permeability and retention effect (EPR effect) that
may be seen with compounds targeting cancer cells may be
increased or decreased by varying the polymer size and/or
architecture. Further, the binding aﬂinity may be modiﬁed
through the use of different binding moieties,

[0082] With respect to the binding moiety, the binding
moiety can be an Aﬁibody® that serves to bind to a target or
epitope of interest. Those of ordinary skill in the art can
identify whether a target or epitope is associated with a
useful target in a given patient, and if so, what the target or
epitope is and/or how to obtain a binding moiety (e.g.,
raising an antibody to the epitope) that will bind to that
target or epitope. Often, the target will be a xenobiotic,
cancer cell, and/or a protein indicative of a diseased state,
Other disease states that might be targeted include, for
example. inﬂammation, sites of infection, metabolic dis-
eases, or other diseases where localization of the active drug
will improve eﬁicacy and/or safety.

[0083] The compounds of the invention, by including a
binding moiety, are more likely to localize to the target to
which the binding moiety binds. In some instances, the
target is located on and/or associated with a larger particle
(e.g., a protein, such as a receptor protein, on a cell or virus).
In some instances, the target circulates and/or travels in vivo,
such as a ligand located on and/or associated with a cell or
soluble macromolecule. In some instances, the target may be
a receptor or other tissue-speciﬁc protein (that is attached to
the membrane or part of the extraceullar matrix) F urther-
more, because the compounds of the invention also include
a phamtacologically active agent, the compounds similarly
localize the pharmacologically active agent. In this way,
upon administration of a compound of the invention, a
pharmacologically active agent can better localize to an area
of interest.

[0084] For example, binding moieties include Aﬂibody®
molecules (Afﬁbody AB, Stockholm, Sweden) (see eg,
US, Pat, Nos. 6,955,877, 6,740,734 and 6,602,977, US,
Patent Publication Nos. US 2010/0048868, US 2011/
0020223, and US 2009/0016957, and International Appli-
cation No, WO 00/63243). Exemplary, yet non-limiting,
binding moieties are described below.

[0085] Aﬁibody® molecules are small non-immunoglohu-
lin aﬂinity ligands based on a 58-amino-acid Z—domain
scaffold, derived from one of the IgG-binding domains of
staphylococcal protein A. Orlova, et al,, (2007) Cancer Res,
67; 2178, Randomization of 13 amino acid positions in the
binding surface of this domain scaﬁold has been used for
construction of combinatorial phagemid libraries, from
which Aﬂibody® molecules binding desired target mol-
ecules can be selected by phage display. For example,
Aﬂibody® molecules have been prepared for binding to
HER2, CAIX, PDGFR beta, epidermal growth factor recep-
tor (EGFR, ErbB), prostate speciﬁc membrane antigen
(PSMA), ﬁbrinogen, human serum albumin (HSA), immu-

globulin G (IgG), immunoglobulin M (lgM), interleukin 8

[0061] “Pharmacologically effective amount, physi-
ologically effective amount,” and “therapeutically eﬁective
amount” are used interchangeably herein to mean the
amount of a compound present in a composition that is
needed to provide a threshold level of active agent and/or
conjugate in the bloodstream or in the target tissue. The
precise amount will depend upon numerous factors, e.g,, the
particular active agent, the components and physical char-
acteristics of the composition, intended patient population,
patient considerations, and the like, and can readily be
determined by one skilled in the art, based upon the infor-
mation provided herein and available in the relevant litera-
ture.

[0062] A “difunctional” polymer is a polymer having two
functional groups contained therein, typically at its termini
When the functional groups are the same, the polymer is said
to be homodifunctional, When the functional groups are
different, the polymer is said to be heterobifunctionaL
[0063] “Multifunctional” in the context of a polymer of
the invention means a polymer having 3 or more functional
groups contained therein, where the functional groups may
be the same or different. Multifunctional polymers of the
invention will typically contain from about 3-100 functional
groups, or from 3-50 functional groups, or from 3-25
functional groups, or from 3-15 functional groups, or from
3 to 10 functional groups, or will contain 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
or 10 functional groups within the polymer

[0064] A basic reactant or an acidic reactant described
herein include neutral, charged, and any corresponding salt
forms thereof which have basic or acidic character under any
deﬁnition (e.g. Bronsted, Lewis, etc.)

[0065] The term “patien” refers to a living organism
suﬁering from or prone to a condition that can be prevented
or treated by administration of a conjugate as described
herein, typically, but not necessarily, in the form of a
water-soluble polymer-small molecule drug conjugate, and
includes both humans and animals,

[0066] “Optional” or “optionally” means that the subse-
quently described circumstance may but need not necessar-
ily occur, so that the description includes instances where the
circumstance occurs and instances where it does not.
[0067] With respect to branched water-soluble, non-pep-
tidic polymers, these polymers typically contain a two
discemable end capped water-soluble, non-peptidic poly-
mers connected via a branch point, which is connected
through a spacer to either a functional group (prior to
conjugation) or small molecule drug residue. Exemplary
branched forms of water-soluble, non-peptidic polymers are
described herein and in WO 2005/107815, WC 2005/
108463, US. Pat, Nos, 5,932,462 and 7,026,440, and US,
Patent Application Publication No. 2005/0009988. Among
other beneﬁts, branched water-soluble, non-peptidic poly-
mersigiven the presence of two discemable water-soluble,
non-peptidic polymersihave the potential to provide
greater polymer character compared to, for example, a linear
polymer having a single water-soluble, non-peptidic poly-
mer.

[0068] As used herein, reference to a “water-soluble,
non-peptidic polymer” (e.g,, “POLY”) is considered to
include branched and multi-arm forms even though two or
more discemable water-soluble, non-peptidic polymers can
be identiﬁed.

[0069] With respect to multi-arm water-soluble, non-pep-
tidic polymers, these polymers typically contain three or
more discemable water-soluble, non-peptidic polymers,
each having the ability to covalently attach to a moiety of
interest, and each typically connected to a central core
moiety (e.g., a residue of a polyol). Among other beneﬁts,
multi-arm water-soluble, non-peptidic polymersggiven the
ability of each arm to covalently attach to a drug or a binding
agentihave the potential to provide greater drug character
compared to, for example, a linear polymer having a single
drug attached thereto.

as “branched,” “linear,” “forked,” “multifunctional,” and tie
like, to he described in greater detail below.

[0036] An “end capping group” is generally a non-reactive
carbon-containing group attached to a terminal oxygen 0 a
PEG polymer Exemplary end capping groups comprise a
C15 alkyl group, such as methyl, ethyl and benzyl), as well
as aryl, heteroaryl, cyclo, heterocyclo, and the like. For tie
purposes of the present invention, certain capping groups
have relatively low molecular weights such as methyl or
ethyl. The end-capping group can also comprise a detectable
label. Such labels include, without limitation, ﬂuorescers,
chemiluminescers, moieties used in enzyme labeling, co o-
rimetric labels (e.g., dyes), metal ions, and radioactive
moieties.

[0037] Molecular weight in the context of a water-soluble
polymer or water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer, such as
PEG, can be expressed as either a number average molecu ar
weight or a weight average molecular weight. In certain
instances, the average molecular weight is recited in Daltons
or kilodaltons (kD). When adjacent to a PEG, this value is
meant to designate the average molecular weight of tie
PEG, as opposed to the number of repeating units in tie
PEG. Unless otherwise indicated, all references to molecu ar
weight herein refer to the weight average molecular weigit.
Both molecular weight determinations, number average and
weight average, can be measured using gel permeation
chromatography or other liquid chromatography techniques.
Other methods for measuring molecular weight values can
also be used, such as the use of end-group analysis or 1 1e
measurement of colligative properties (e.g., freezing-point
depression, boiling-point elevation, or osmotic pressure) to
determine number average molecular weight or the use of
light scat1ering techniques, ultracentrifugation or viscometry
to determine weight average molecular weight. The po y-
mers of the invention are typically polydisperse (i.e., num-
ber average molecular weight and weight average molecu ar
weight of the polymers are not equal), possessing low
polydispersity values of less than about 1.2, in certain
embodiments less than about 1.15, in certain embodiments
less than about 1.10, in certain embodiments less than about
1.05, and in certain embodiments less than about 1.03.

[0038] “Branched”, in reference to the geometry or overall
structure of a polymer, refers to a polymer having two or
more polymers representing distinct “arms” that extend from
a branch point.

[0039] “Forked” in reference to the geometry or overall
structure of polymer, refers to a polymer having two or more
functional groups (typically through one or more atoms)
extending from a branch point.

 

[0040] A “branch point" refers to a bifurcation point
comprising one or more atoms at which a polymer branches
or forks from a linear structure into one or more additional
arms.

[0041] The terms “active,” “reactive” or “activated" when
used in conjunction with a particular functional group, refers
to a reactive functional group that reacts readily with an
electrophile or a nucleophile on another molecule. This is in
contrast to those groups that require strong catalysts or
highly impractical reaction conditions in order to react (i.e.,
a “non-reactive” or “inert” group),

[0042] “Not readily reactive,” with reference to a func-
tional group present on a molecule in a reaction mixture,

Jan. 31, 2019

indicates that the group remains largely intact under condi-
tions that are etfective to produce a desired reaction in the
reaction mixture.

[0043] A “protecting group” is a moiety that prevents or
blocks reaction of a particular chemically reactive functional
group in a molecule under certain reaction conditions. The
protecting group will vary depending upon the type of
chemically reactive group being protected as well as the
reaction conditions to be employed and the presence of
additional reactive or protecting groups in the molecule.
Functional groups which may be protected include, by way
of example, carboxylic acid groups, amino groups, hydroxyl
groups, thiol groups, carbonyl groups and the like. Repre-
sentative protecting groups for carboxylic acids include
esters (such as a p-methoxybenzyl ester), amides and
hydrazides; for amino groups, carbamates (such as tert-
butoxycarbonyl) and amides; for hydroxyl groups, ethers
and esters; for thiol groups, thioethers and thioesters, for
carbonyl groups, acetals and ketals, and the like. Such
protecting groups are well-known to those skilled in the art
and are described, for example, in T. W. Greene and G, M,
Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edi-
tion, Wiley, N.Y., 1999, and references cited therein.

[0044] A functional group in “protected form” refers to a
functional group bearing a protecting group. As used herein,
the term “functional group” or any synonym thereof encom-
passes protected fonns thereof

[0045] The terms “spacer moiety,” “linkage” and “linker”
are used herein to refer to a bond or an atom or a collection
of atoms optionally used to link interconnecting moieties
such as a terminus of a polymer segment and a binding
moiety or pharmacologically active agent or an electrophile
or nucleophile of a binding moiety or pharmacologically
active agent. The spacer moiety may be hydrolytically stable
or may include a physiologically hydrolyzable or enzymati-
cally degradable linkage. Unless the context clearly dictates
otherwise, a spacer moiety optionally exists between any
two elements of a compound (e.g., the provided conjugates
comprising a residue of a binding moiety or pharmacologi-
cally active agent and water-soluble polymer can attached
directly or indirectly through a spacer moiety),

[0046] “Electrophile” and “electrophilic group” refer to an
ion or atom or collection of atoms, which may be ionic,
having an electrophilic center, i.e., a center that is electron
seeking, capable of reacting with a nucleophile.

[0047] “Nucleophile” and “nucleophilic group” refers to
an ion or atom or collection of atoms that may be ionic
having a nucleophilic center, i.e., a center that is seeking an
electrophilic center or with an electrophile.

[0048] A “physiologically cleavable” or “hydrolyzable” or
“degradable” bond is a relatively labile bond that reacts with
water (i.e., is hydrolyzed) under ordinary physiological
conditions. The tendency of a bond to hydrolyze in water
under ordinary physiological conditions will depend not
only on the general type of linkage connecting two central
atoms but also on the substituents attached to these central
atoms. Such bonds are generally recognizable by those of
ordinary skill in the art. Appropriate hydrolytically unstable
or weak linkages include but are not limited to carboxylate
ester, phosphate ester, anhydrides, acetals, ketals, acyloxy-
alkyl ether, imines, orthoesters, peptides, oligonucleotides,
thioesters, and carbonates.

group consisting of alkyl, substituted alkyl, alkenyl, substi-
tuted alkenyl, alkynyl, substituted alkynyl, aryl and substi-
tuted aryl. Additional spacer moieties include, acylamino,
acyl, aryloxy, alkylene bridge containing between 1 and 5
inclusive carbon atoms, alkylamino, dialkylamino having
about 2 to 4 inclusive carbon atoms, piperidino, pyr'rolidino,
N-(Iower alky1)-2-piperidyl, morpholino, 1-piperizinyl,

dine, ester, carbonate, and phosphate, In some instances, a
portion or a functional group of the drug compound may be
modiﬁed or removed altogether to facilitate attachment of
the oligorner.

[0158] For purposes of the present invention, however, a
group of atoms is not considered a spacer moiety when it is
immediately adjacent to the water-soluble, non-peptidic
polymer, and the group of atoms is the same as a monomer
of the water-soluble, non-peptidic oligomer such that the
group proposed to be a spacer moiety would represent a
mere addition of another monomer

[0159] For any given spacer moiety included Within the
compounds described herein, the spacer moiety can include
a releasable bond (such as a hydrolytically releasable bond,
e.g,, an ester bond). In addition, for any given spacer moiety
Within the compounds described herein, all bonds within
spacer moiety can be non-releasable bonds (e.g,, all hydro-
lytically stable bonds) In certain embodiments the spacer
may trigger release based on a reduction or oxidation of the
spacer. Various combinations of spacers may be used to
achieve a desired effect, As a non-limiting example, for the
compounds of the present invention, the spacer moiety may
be tuned so that the pharmacologically active agent or
binding moiety is released extracellurally (eig. outside of the
cell expressing the particular target of the binding moiety),
Alternatively, in instances where the binding results in
internalization of the compounds of the invention (or por-
tions thereof) the spacers may be chosen such that the
pharmacologically active agent or binding moiety remains
bound extracellularly, but may be released intracellularly.

[0160] In order to attach the desired binding moiety or
pharmacologically active agent to the Water-soluble, non-
peptidic polymer, a suitable polymeric reagent is allowed to
contact the desired species (either the binding moiety or the

Jan. 3], 2019

phannacolog'ically active agent). Those of ordinary skill in
the art know or can determine through routine experimen-
tation whether any given polymeric reagent is suited for
forming a conjugate with a speciﬁc active agent. For
example, species having one or more amine groups will
react with polymeric reagents hearing an electrophilic
group, as discussed above, In addition, one may simply
contact a proposed polymeric reagent with the desired
species and determine whether conjugation has been
elfected by running the reaction mixture through a size-
exclusion column; the relatively large conjugates%om-
prised of both polymer and active agentiwill be elute
before both the nonconjugated polymeric reagent and active
agent,

[0161] Often, a heterobifunctional polymeric reagent, e,g.,
a polymeric reagent bearing a ﬁrst reactive group and a
second reactive group wherein the ﬁrst reactive group and
second reactive group are diﬂrerent, By using a heterobi-
functional polymeric reagent, a ﬁrst reactive group Within
the heterobifunctional polymeric reagent can be used to
react with either the binding moiety or pharrnacologically
active agent to form an initial conjugate, followed by
reaction of the second reactive group (originating from the
heterobifunctional reagent and remaining in the initial con-
jugate) to the other moietygeither the binding moiety or
pharmacologically active agent, whichever is absent from
the initial conjugate, In this regard, the adaption of orthogo-
nal synthetic strategies [see Baranay et all (1977) J, Am,
Chem, Soc. 11617363-7365] is one approach for preparing
the compounds of the invention using heterobifuntional
polymeric reagents, Brieﬂy, this approach relies on a strat-
egy wherein (i) a ﬁrst reactive group (“rGrl”) of a polymeric
reagent can be activated under conditions Abut stable under
conditions B, and (ii) a second reactive group (“r612”) can
be activated under conditions B but stable under conditions
A. Individual synthons [such as the binding moiety (“Ab”)
and pharmacologically active agent (“Dr”)] carry unique (or
substantially disparate amounts of different) functional
groups that are speciﬁc or selective for one of the ﬁrst
reactive group (“rGrl”) or second reactive group (“rGrz”),
Schematically, the synthetic reaction appears as follows:

Heterobifunctional polymeric reagents are available com-
mercially and/or are described in the literature.

[0162] In one approach, by relying on difference reactive
groups of a heterobifunctional polymer (e.g., a polymeric
reagent bearing both a sullhydr'yl-selective reactive group,
such as a maleimide, and an amine-selective reactive group,
such as a succinimidyl) it is possible to take advantage of an
sulfhydryl-containing binding moiety and an amine-contain-
ing, sulthydryl-lacking pharmacologically active agent. This
same principle can be adapted for different pairs of func-
tional groups in the binding moiety/pharmacologically
active agent:

[0163] In another approach, the compounds of the inven-
tion can be prepared by relying on blocking chemistry,
wherein attachment of one species (either the binding moi-
ety or the pharmacologically active agent) is attached with
a polymeric reagent bearing a blocking or protecting group,
followed by removal of the blocking or protecting group
using conventional techniques, and subsequent attachment
of the other species (the other of the binding moiety or
pharmacologically active agent).

[0164] Having selected a polymeric reagent and synthon
(eg, a binding moiety or a pharmacologically active agent),
the polymeric reagent is typically added to the synthon in an
equimolar amount (with respect to the desired number of
groups suitable for reaction with the reactive group) or at
molar excess. For example, the polymeric reagent can be
added to the synthon at a molar ratio of about 1:1 (polymer:
synthon), 1.5:1, 2:1, 3:1, 4:1, 5:1, 6:1, 8:1, 10:1, 20:1 or
40:1.

[0165] The conjugation reaction is allowed to proceed
until substantially no further conjugation occurs, which can
generally be determined by monitoring the progress of the
reaction over time. Progress of the reaction can be monitored
by withdrawing aliquots from the reaction mixture at various
time points and analyzing the reaction mixture by SDS-
PAGE or MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, high-perfor-
mance liquid chromatography (HPLC), or any other suitable
analytical method. Once a plateau is reached with respect to
the amount of conjugate formed or the amount of unconju-
gated polymeric reagent remaining, the reaction is assumed
to be complete.

[0166] Typically, the conjugation reaction takes anywhere
from minutes to several hours (e.g., from 5 minutes to 24
hours or more). The resulting population of conjugates is
preferably, but not necessarily, puriﬁed so as to separate out
excess reagents, unconjugated synthon, undesired multi-
conjugated species, and free or unreacted polymeric reagent:
The resulting population can also be further characterized
using analytical methods such as MALDI, capillary electro-
phoresis, gel electrophoresis, and/or chromatography.
[0167] With respect to the resulting conjugates, the con-
jugates can optionally be puriﬁed to obtain/isolate different
conjugated species. Once the ﬁrst of the binding moiety or
pharmacologically active agent has been attached to the
water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer, the other of the bind-
ing moiety or pharmacologically active agent can be
attached following a similar technique:

[0168] The pharmacologically active agent for coupling to
a water-soluble, non-peptidic polymer may possess a free
hydroxyl, carboxyl, thio, amino group, or the like (i.e:,
“handle”) suitable for covalent attachment to the polymer: In
addition, the pharmacologically active agent may be modi-
ﬁed by introduction of a reactive group, preferably by

Jan. 31, 2019

conversion of one of its existing functional groups to a
functional group suitable for formation of a stable covalent
linkage between the polymer and the drug.

[0169] Certain Aﬂibody® molecules contain a unique
C-terminal cysteine that serves as a site for targeted modi-
ﬁcation: With respect to PEGylation, Aﬂibody® molecules
may be modiﬁed with sulfhydryl-reactive PEG reagents
disclosed herein, including for example maleimide-PEG
reagents. Due the presence of the terminal cysteine the
Aﬁibody® molecules may form sulﬁde-linked covalent
dimers. As such, the dimers may need to be reduced prior to
PEGylation: Further, it may be necessary to remove the
reducing agent prior to PEGylation. Additionally, steps may
need to be taken to reduce the tendency of the dimers to
reform. In light of above, reduction and PEGylation condi-
tions that reduce the likelihood of Aﬂibody® dimerization
while allowing the attachment of PEG to the free thiol group
have been developed and are described below.

[0170] In order to expose the reactive cysteine, it may be
necessary to reduce the dimers. In certain embodiments,
reactions of the free Afﬁbody® molecules take place in an
environment that prevents formation of disulfide bridges. As
such, in certain embodiments, PEGylation of Aﬁibodys
takes place by reducing the disulﬂde linked Aﬂibody®
dimers and incubation of the free Aﬂibody® molecules with
a thiol reactive PEG reagent. In some embodiments the
reduction takes place in the presence of a suitable reducing
agent. In certain embodiments, the reducing agent is selected
from 2-mercaptoethanol, dithiothreitol (DTT), and tris(2-
carboxyethyl)phosphine (TCEP). In certain embodiments,
the reducing agent (e.g DTT) is removed from the free
Aﬂibody® molecules prior to PEGylation. In certain
embodiments, the reducing agent is removed via ion
exchangdreverse phase chromatography. In certain embodi-
ments, the PEGylation step takes place at a pH below about
7.4. In certain embodiments the PEGylation step takes place
at a pH between about 3.0 and about 7.0. In certain embodi-
ments, the PEGylation step takes place at a pH between
about 5.0 and about 7.0. In certain embodiments, the PEGy-
lation step takes place at a pH between about 5.5 and about
6.5. In certain embodiments, the PEGylation step Hikes place
at a pH of about 6.0. In certain embodiments, the PEGy-
lation step takes place in the presence of EDTA.

[0171] The present invention also includes pharmaceutical
preparations comprising the compounds provided herein in
combination with a pharmaceutical excipient. Thus, the
method for making the compositions herein includes the
optional step of adding a pharmaceutically acceptable
excipient. Generally, the composition itself will be in a solid
form (eg, a precipitate), which can be combined with a
suitable pharmaceutical excipient that can be in either solid
or liquid form. For example, the compositions (and corre-
sponding pharmaceutical preparations) can be provided in a
lyophilized form or in a solution.

[0172] Depending on the intended mode of administration,
the composition may be a liquid, semi-solid or solid. Exem-
plary liquids include a suspension, a solution, an emulsion,
and a syrup, which can be formulated for administration to
a patient. Exemplary semi-solids include gels which can be
administered “as is” or formulated (eg, into a gel-cap) for
administration to a patient: Exemplary solids include gran-
ules, pellets, beads, powders, which can be administered “as
is” or formulated into one or more of the following for
administration to a patient: a tablet; a capsule; a caplet; a

[0049] An “enzymatically degradable linkage” means a
linkage that is subject to degradation by one or more
enzymes under ordinary physiological conditions.

[0050] A “hydrolytically stable” linkage or bond refers to
a chemical moiety or bond, typically a covalent bond, that is
substantially stable in water, that is to say, does not undergo
hydrolysis under ordinary physiological conditions to any
appreciable extent over an extended period of time,
Examples of hydrolytically stable linkages include but are
not limited to the following: carbon-carbon bonds (e.g,, in
aliphatic chains), ethers, amides, urethanes, amines, and the
like. Generally, a stable linkage is one that exhibits a rate of
hydrolysis of less than about 1-2% per day under ordinary
physiological conditions. Hydrolysis rates of representative
chemical bonds can be found in most standard chemistry
textbooks,

[0051] “Substantially” or “essentially" means nearly
totally or completely, for instance, 95% or greater, in certain
embodiments 97% or greater, in certain embodiments 98%
or greater, in certain embodiments 99% or greater, in certain
embodiments 999% or greater, and in certain embodiments
99.99% or greater

[0052] “Monodisperse” refers to a polymer composition
wherein substantially all of the polymers in the composition
have a well-deﬁned, single molecular weight and deﬁned
number of monomers, as determined by chromatography or
mass spectrometry, Monodisperse polymer compositions are
in one sense pure, that is, substantially comprising mol-
ecules having a single and deﬁnable number of monomers
rather than several dilferent numbers of monomers (i,e., a
polymer composition having three or more different polymer
sizes). A monodisperse polymer composition possesses a
MW/Mn value of 10005 or less, and in certain embodi-
ments, a MW/Mn value of 10000, By extension, a compo-
sition comprised of monodisperse conjugates means that
substantially all polymers of all conjugates in the composi-
tion have a single and deﬁnable number (as a whole number)
of monomers rather than a distribution and would possess a
MW/Mn value of 1.0005. and in certain embodiments, a
MW/Mn value of 10000 if the polymer were not attached to
the residue of the small molecule drug, A composition
comprised of monodisperse conjugates can include, how-
ever, one or more nonconjugate substances such as solvents,
reagents, excipients, and so forth

[0053] “Bimodal,” in reference to a polymer composition,
refers to a polymer composition wherein substantially all
polymers in the composition have one of two deﬁnable and
different numbers (as whole numbers) of monomers rather
than a distribution, and whose distribution of molecular
weights, when plotted as a number fraction versus molecular
weight, appears as two separate identiﬁable peaks, In certain
embodiments, for a bimodal polymer composition as
described herein, each peak is generally symmetric about its
mean, although the size of the two peaks may differ Ideally,
the polydispersity index of each peak in the bimodal distri-
bution, Mw/Mn, is 101 or less, in certain embodiments
1.001 or less, and in certain embodiments 10005 or less, and
in certain embodiments a MW/Mn value of 10000, By
extension, a composition comprised of bimodal conjugates
means that substantially all polymers of all conjugates in the
composition have one of two deﬁnable and different num-
bers (as whole numbers) of monomers rather than a large
distribution and would possess a MW/Mn value of 1,0] or
less, in certain embodiments 1,001 or less and in certain

embodiments 10005 or less, and in certain embodiments a
MW/Mn value of 1.0000 if the polymer were not attached to
the residue of the six-membered heterocyclic nucleoside. A
composition comprised of bimodal conjugates can include,
however, one or more nonconjugate substances such as
solvents, reagents, excipients, and so forth.

[0054] The terms “active agent,” “biologically active
agent” and “pharmacologically active agent” are used inter-
changeably herein and are deﬁned to include any agent,
drug, compound, composition of matter or mixture that
provides some pharmacologic, often beneﬁcial, effect that
can be demonstrated in vivo or in vitro. This includes foods,
food supplements, nutrients, nutriceuticals, drugs, peptides,
vaccines, antibodies, vitamins, and other beneﬁcial agents.
As used herein, these terms further include any physiologi-
cally or pharmacologically active substance that produces a
localized or systemic effect in a patient

[0055] “Alkyl” refers to a hydrocarbon chain, typically
ranging from about 1 to 20 atoms in length, Such hydro-
carbon chains may be but are not necessarily saturated and
may be branched or straight chain, although typically
straight chain is preferred, Exemplary alkyl groups include
methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, pentyl, l-methylbutyl, l-ethyl-
propyl, 3-methylpentyl, and the like, As used herein, “alkyl”
includes cycloalkyl when three or more carbon atoms are
referenced. An “alkenyl” group is an alkyl of 2 to 20 carbon
atoms with at least one carbon-carbon double bond,

[0056] The terms “substituted alkyl" or “substituted CW
alkyl” where q and r are integers identifying the range of
carbon atoms contained in the alkyl group, denotes the
above alkyl groups that are substituted by one, two or three
halo (e.g,, F, Cl, Br, I), triﬂuoromethyl, hydroxy, C1_7 alkyl
(e.g., methyl, ethyl, n»propyl, isopropyl, butyl, t-butyl, and
so forth), C1,7 alkoxy, C 177 acyloxy, C3,—, heterocyclic,
amino, phenoxy, nitro, carboxy, carboxy, acyl, cyano, The
substituted alkyl groups may be substituted once, twice or
three times with the same or with different substituents,
[0057] “Lower alkyl" refers to an alkyl group containing
from 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and may be straight chain or
branched, as exempliﬁed by methyl, ethyl, n-butyl, i-butyl,
t-butyl, “Lower alkenyl” refers to a lower alkyl group of 2
to 6 carbon atoms having at least one carbon-carbon double
bond,

[0058] “Alkoxy” refers to an 70~R group. wherein R is
alkyl or substituted alkyl, in certain embodiments C1-C20
alkyl (e.g,, methoxy, ethoxy, propyloxy, benzyl, etc), in
certain embodiments C1-C7. For the purpose of this inven-
tion, alkoxy groups may also include aryl substituents when
such substituents follow at least one alkyl group, eg ben-
zyloxy. The latter are also called “arylalkoxy” substituents.
[0059] “Pharmaceutically acceptable excipient” or “phar-
maceutically acceptable carrier” refers to component that
can be included in the compositions of the invention in order
to provide for a composition that has an advantage (e,g.,
more suited for administration to a patient) over a compo-
sition lacking the component and that is recognized as not
causing signiﬁcant adverse toxicological effects to a patient,
[0060] The term “aryl" means an aromatic group having
up to 14 carbon atoms, Aryl groups include phenyl, naph-
thyl, biphenyl, phenanthrenyl, naphthacenyl, and the like.
“Substituted phenyl” and “substituted aryl” denote a phenyl
group and aryl group, respectively, substituted with one,
two, three, four or ﬁve (e,g., 1-2, 1-3 or 1-4 substituents)
chosen from halo (F, Cl, Br, 1), hydroxy, hydroxy, cyano,

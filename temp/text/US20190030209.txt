FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0002] The present application relates to bioactive
implants, methods of making bioactive implants, and meth-
ods of using bioactive implants to treat or repair bone or
cartilage defects.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] The basic elements required for bone formation
include a three-dimensional, open-porosity tissue scaﬁold,
cells, and osteoinductive signaling molecules to stimulate
cell diiferentiation, proliferation, and matrix formation. The
biologic, physical, and biomechanical properties of the
materials, compositions, and constructs are some of the
major factors in determining their suitability for the use in
the treatment and repair of bone and cartilage defects. For
example, successful bone formation requires that these ele-
ments be combined in a well-coordinated spatial and time
dependent fashion. Moreover, the relative contribution of
each element may vary, e.g., according to differences in
patient age, gender, health, systemic conditions, habits,
anatomical location, etc.

[0004] Despite advances in the understanding in the treat-
ment and repair of bone and cartilage defects, there is still
a need for bioactive implants that are biocompatible, non-
inﬂammatory, osteogenic, and chondrogenic, and can be
replaced by a subject’s natural bone and cartilage

DETAILED DESC {IPTION OF THE
INVENTION

[0130] The present invention can be understood more
readily by reference to the fol owing detailed description of
the invention and the Examp es included therein.

[0131] Before the present compounds, compositions,
articles, systems, devices, and/or methods are disclosed and
described, it is to be understood that they are not limited to
speciﬁc synthetic methods uness otherwise speciﬁed, or to
particular reagents unless otherwise speciﬁed, as such may,
of course, varyr It is also to 3e understood that the termi-
nology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular
aspects only and is not intended to be limiting. Although any
methods and materials similar or equivalent to those
US 2019/0030209 A1

[0167] As used herein, “resorbable” refers to the ability of
a material to be broken down over a period of time and
assimilated into the biological environment

[0168] As used herein, “embedded” refers to the physical
relationship of the bone microparticles, cartilage micropar-
ticles, or both in a speciﬁc solution. In an aspect, “embed”
means to fix an object, such as bone and cartilage micropar-
ticles, ﬁrmly and deeply in a surrounding mass, such as, for
example, a desiccated solution.

[0169] As used herein, “biocompatible” refers to the abil-
ity of a composition or a bioactive implant disclosed herein
to perform with an appropriate host response in a speciﬁc
application, or at least to perform without having a toxic or
otherwise deleterious effect on a biological system of the
host (either locally or systemically).

[0170] As used herein, “biodegradable” refers to the abil-
ity of a composition or a bioactive implant disclosed herein
to be degraded, disassembled and/or digested over time by
action of a biological environment (including the action of
living organisms, e.g., the patient's body) and/or in response
to a change in physiological pH or temperature

[0171] As used herein, “osteoconductive” refers to the
ability of a composition or a bioactive implant disclosed
herein to passively permit bone growth (e.g,, onto and/or
into the composition or bioactive implant). As such, osteo-
conduction can be characterized as a passive process. A
bioactive implant can be osteoconductive, for example,
because it permits growth of bone on one or more surfaces.
In an aspect, a bioactive implant disclosed herein can be
osteoconductive.

[0172] As used herein, “osteoinductive” refers to the abil-
ity of a composition or a bioactive implant disclosed herein
to actively stimulate a biological response that induces bone
formation. As such, osteoinduction can be characterized as
an active process. Osteoinduction can include, but is not
limited to, the formation and/or stimulation of osteoprogeni-
tor cells, such as osteoprogenitor cells, in bodily tissue
surrounding or proximate to a bioactive implant. In an
aspect, a bioactive implant disclosed herein can he osteoin-
ductive.

[0173] As used herein, “demineralized bone matrix”
(DBM) can be osteoconductive and osteoinductive, DBM
retains much of the proteinaceous components native to
bone, with small amounts of calcium-based solids, inorganic
phosphates, and some trace cell debris. Many of these
proteinaceous components (e.g,, growth factors) are known
to be potent osteogenic agents. DBM provides a degradable
matrix facilitating endogenous release of these proteina-
ceous components at the site of a bone defect, thereby
inducing new bone formation and accelerating healing.

Jan. 31, 2019

[0174] As used herein, “dernineralized” is intended to
encompass such expressions as “substantially demineral-
ized”, “partially demineralized”, “surface demineralized”,
and “fully demineralized.” In an aspect, “partially deminer-
alized” can encompass “surface demineralized”.

[0175] In an aspect, a bone or cartilage defect can be, for
example, a void, gap, or other defect in a bone or other bony
structure in a body of a subject. For example, a defect can
be in the spine, pelvis, an extremity, the craniurn, or another
bone or bony structure in the subject’s body. In an aspect, a
defect can include a site requiring bone, joint, cartilage, or
ligament repair, construction, fusion, regeneration, or aug-
mentation. The defect can be an osteochondral defect, such
as an osteochondral plug, Such a defect traverses the entirety
of the overlying cartilage and enters, at least in part, the
underlying bony structure. In contrast, a chondral or sub-
chondral defect traverses the overlying cartilage, in part or
in whole, respectively, but does not involve the underlying
bone. Other defects amenable to repair using the composi-
tion, bioactive implants, and methods disclosed herein
include, but are not limited to, non-union fractures; bone
cavities; tumor resection; fresh fractures (distracted or
undistracted); cranial, maxillofacial and facial abnonnali-
ties, for example, in facial skeletal reconstruction, speciﬁ-
cally, orbital ﬂoor reconstruction, augmentation of the alveo-
lar ridge or sinus, periodontal defects and tooth extraction
socket; cranioplasty, genioplasty, chin augmentation, palate
reconstruction, and other large bony reconstructions; verte-
broplasty, interbody fusions in the cervical, thoracic and
lumbar spine and posteriolateral fusions in the thoracic and
lumbar spine; in osteomyelitis for bone regeneration; appen-
dicular fusion, ankle fusion, total hip, knee and joint fusions
or arthroplasty; correcting tendon and/or ligamentous tissue
defects such as, for example, the anterior, posterior, lateral
and medial ligaments of the knee, the patella and Achilles
tendons, and the like as well as those defects resulting from
diseases such as cancer, arthritis, including osteoarthritis,
and other bone degenerative disorders such as osteochon-
dritis dessicans.

[0176] As used herein, “hydroxycthyl starch” (HES) is a
derivative of amylopectin, which is a highly branched com-
pound of starch. In humans and animals, amylopectin is
rapidly hydrolde by amylase. Hydroxyethyl starches are

treatment and/or repair of a bone or cartilage defect As used
herein, the terms “effective amount” and “amount effective”
can refer to an amount that is suﬁicient to achieve the desired
an effect on an undesired condition (e.g,, bone or cartilage
defect), For example, a “therapeutically effective amount”
refers to an amount that is sufﬁcient to achieve the desired
therapeutic result or to have an effect on undesired symp-
toms, but is generally insuﬁicient to cause adverse side
effects. The speciﬁc therapeutically effective dose level for
any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors
including the disorder being treated and the severity of the
disorder; the speciﬁc composition employed; the age, body
weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time
of administration; the route of administration; the rate of
excretion of the speciﬁc compound employed; the duration
of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental
with the speciﬁc compound employed and like factors well
known in the medical artsi For example, it is well within the
skill of the art to start doses of a compound at levels lower
than those required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect
and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired eifect
is achieved. If desired, then the eifective daily dose can be
divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration,
Consequently, single dose compositions can contain such
amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose,
The dosage can be adjusted by the individual physician in
the event of any contraindications Dosage can vary, and can
be administered in one or more dose administrations daily,
for one or several days. Guidance can be found in the
literature for appropriate dosages for given classes of phar-
maceutical products. In further various aspects, a prepara-
tion can be administered in a “prophylactically effective
amount”; that is, an amount effective for prevention of a
disease or condition,

[0161] As used herein, “autografts” are bone grafts that
use bone obtained from the same subject that is receiving the
graft. In an aspect, bone can be harvested from non-essential
bones, such as the iliac crest or the ﬁbula, the chin, the ribs,
the mandible, and even parts of the skull, Autogenous bone
possesses all the properties essential for bone formation, In
other words, it is osteoconductive and osteoinductive, and it
houses growth factors and osteogenic cells with no associ-
ated immune or infection related risks (ie, non-immuno-
genic)i Autologous bone fracts are slowly replaced by newly
formed host bone, The disadvantages of autografts include
possible post-operative pain and complications as well as
blood loss, hematomas, infection, fracture, neurovascular
injury, and cosmetic deformity at the explantation site,
Autografts also require longer operative time Moreover, the
availability of an autogenous bone graft is limited in a
pediatric subject or in an elderly subject as well as those
subjects aﬁlicted with osteopenia and osteoporosis.

[0162] As used herein, “allograﬁs” can be derived from a
subject other than the subject receiving the graﬁ, Allograft
bone can be collected from either living donors (e.g,,
patients receiving a total hip replacement surgery) or non-
living donors. Allograﬁs are typically processed by a bone
tissue bank, An allograﬁ can be osteoconductive and can be
weakly osteoinductive. Processing an allograft can often
require sterilization (i,e., gamma irradiation), which can
detrimentally affect the mechanical properties of bone, and
can deactivate proteins normally found in healthy bone.

[0163] As used herein, “xenografts” are bone grafts that
originate in a species other than the species of the subject

Jan. 3], 2019

receiving the graft For example, if subject is human, then a
xenograft can be derived from a bovine bone or a porcine
bone, In an aspect, the xenograﬁ can be freeze-dried and/or
demineralized and deproteinized

[0164] Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are known
to the art, As used herein, BMPs include, but are not limited
to, BMPl, BMPZ, BMPS, BMP4, BMPS, BMP6, BMP7,
BM 8a, BMPSb, BMPlO, and BMPlS, BMPs exist at high
concentration within bone and are secreted by many bone-
forming cell types, Cellular signaling is an important func-
tion of BMPS, The art generally considers BMPZ, BMP4,
BM ’6, and BMP7 to be the most osteoinductive of all
known BWS,

[0133] As used in the speciﬁcation and the appended
claims, the singular forms “a”, “an”, and “the” include plural
referents unless the context clearly dictates otherwise
[0134] The phrase “consisting essentially of” limits the
scope of a claim to the recited components in a composition
or the recited steps in a method as well as those that do not
materially affect the basic and novel characteristic or char-
acteristics of the claimed composition or claimed method.
[0135] The phrase “consisting of" excludes any compo-
nent, step, or element that is not recited in the claimr
[0136] The phrase “comprising” is synonymous with
“including”, “containing”, or “characterized by”, and is
inclusive or open-ended, “Comprising” does not exclude
additional, unrecited components or steps.

[0137] As used herein when referring to any numerical

that is 110% of the stated value,

[0138] Ranges can be expressed herein as from “about”
one particular value, and/or to “about” another particular
value, When such a range is expressed, a further aspect
includes from the one particular value and/or to the other
particular value. Similarly, when values are expressed as
approximations, by use of the antecedent “about,” it will be
understood that the particular value forms a further aspect,
It will be further understood that the endpoints of each of the
ranges are signiﬁcant both in relation to the other endpoint,
and independently of the other endpoint, It is also under-
stood that there are a number of values disclosed herein, and
that each value is also herein disclosed as “about” that
particular value in addition to the value itself. For example,
if the value “10” is disclosed, then “about 10” is also
disclosed It is also understood that each unit between two
particular units are also disclosed For example, if 10 and 15
are disclosed, then 11, 12, 13, and 14 are also disclosed,

mixture of two or more substances, A solution may exist in
any phase. For example, a solution can be a homogeneous
mixture composed of only one phase, wherein a solute (such
as, e.g., HES, non-solubilized HES, polyvinyl pyrrolidone
(PVP), povidone iodine, bone collagen, tendon collagen,
albumin, or a combination thereof) is dissolved in a solvent
(such as, eg, water, saline, alcohol, DMSO, or a combina-
tion thereof). In an aspect, solution disclosed herein is
non-toxic. In an aspect, a disclosed solution comprises
non-toxic components. In an aspect, a disclosed solution is
safe for administration to human beings or other mammals.
[0142] As used herein, the term “subject” refers to the
target of administration or implantation, e.g,, an animal. The
term “subject” also includes domesticated animals (eg,
cats, dogs, etc,), livestock (e.g,, cattle, horses, pigs, sheep,
goats, etc), and laboratory animals (e,g., mouse, rabbit, rat,
guinea pig, fruit fly, etc.). Thus, the subject can be a
vertebrate, such as a mammal, a ﬁsh, a bird, a reptile, or an
amphibian. Alternatively, the subject can be a human, non-
human primate, horse, pig, rabbit, dog, sheep, goat, cow, cat,
guinea pig. or rodent. The term does not denote a particular
age or sex Thus, adult and newborn subjects, as well as
fetuses, whether male or female, are intended to be covered.
In an aspect, a subject can be human. For example, a subject
can have a bone or cartilage defect, or a subject can have
multiple bone or cartilage defects.

[0143] A “patient” refers to a subject afflicted with one or
more diseases or disorders or conditions, such as, for
example, one or more bone or cartilage defects, In an aspect,
a bone or cartilage can require medical intervention. A
patient can refer to a subject that has been diagnosed with or
is suspected 0 having a bone or cartilage defectr

[0144] As used herein, the term “treatment” refers to the
medical management of a patient with the intent to cure,
ameliorate, sta ilize, or prevent a disease, pathological con-
dition, or disorder (such as, for example, a bone or cartilage
defect). This term includes active treatment, that is, treat-
ment directed speciﬁcally toward the improvement of a
disease, pathological condition, or disorder, and also
includes causa treatment, that is, treatment directed toward
removal of the cause of the associated disease, pathological
condition, or cisorder. In addition, this term includes pal-
liative treatment, that is, treatment designed for the relief of
symptoms rather than the curing of the disease, pathological
condition, or disorder; preventative treatment, that is, treat-
ment directed to minimizing or partially or completely
inhibiting the c evelopment of the associated disease, patho-
logical condition, or disorder; and supportive treatment, that
is, treatment employed to supplement another speciﬁc
therapy directed toward the improvement of the associated
disease, patho ogical condition, or disorder. In various
aspects, the term covers any treatment of a subject, including
a mannnal (e.g., a human), and includes: (i) preventing the
disease from occurring in a subject that can be predisposed
to the disease but has not yet been diagnosed as having it; ii)
inhibiting the disease, i.e., arresting its development; or (iii)
relieving the disease, ie, causing regression of the disease.
[0145] In an aspect, “treating” means improving or elimi-
nating a bone or cartilage defect, In an aspect, “treating”
means reducing the effects of a bone or cartilage defect or
the symptoms of a bone or cartilage defect. Thus, in an
US 2019/0030209 A1

aspect of a disclosed method, treating can refer to a 10%,
20%, 30%, 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, or 100%
reduction in the severity of an established bone or cartilage
defect or symptoms of a bone or cartilage defect. For
example, a method for treating a bone or cartilage defect can
reduce one or more symptoms of a bone or cartilage defect
in a subject by 10% as compared to a control. In an aspect,
a reduction of one or more symptoms can be 20%, 30%,
40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, or any percent
reduction in between 10% and 100% as compared to a
control. It is understood that treatment does not necessarily
refer to a cure or complete ablation or eradication of the
bone or cartilage defect. However, in an aspect, treatment
can refer to a cure or complete ablation or eradication of the
bone or cartilage defect.

[0146] As used herein, the temi “prevent” or “preventing”
refers to precluding, averting, obviating, forestalling, stop-
ping, or hindering something from happening, especially by
advance action It is understood that where reduce. inhibit or
prevent are used herein, unless speciﬁcally indicated other-
wise, the use of the other two words is also expressly
disclosed, In an aspect, preventing the worsening of a bone

or cartilage defect or the severity of a bone or cartilage
defect is intended,

[0147] As used herein, the term “diagnosed" means hav-
ing been subjected to a physical examination by a person 0 ‘
skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition
that can be diagnosed or treated by the composition, bioac-
tive implants, and methods disclosed herein. For example,
“diagnosed with a bone or cartilage defect” means having
been subjected to a physical examination by a person 0
skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition
that can be diagnosed or can be treated by a composition or
bioactive implant disclosed herein, such as, for example, a
bioactive implant that can treat or prevent the worsening o
severity of a bone or cartilage defect. For example, “sus-
pected of having a bone or cartilage defect” can mean having
been subjected to a physical examination by a person 0
skill, for example, a physician, and found to have a condition
that can be likely be diagnosed as or can likely be treated by
a composition or bioactive implant that can treat or repair a
bone or cartilage defect.

[0148] As used herein, the terms “administering” anc
“administration” refer to any method of providing a dis-
closed agent or a pharmaceutical preparation comprising a
disclosed agent to a subject, Such methods are well known
to those skilled in the art and include, but are not limited to:
oral administration, transdermal administration, administra-
tion by inhalation, nasal administration, topical administra-
tion, intravaginal administration, ophthalmic administration,
intraaural administration, intracerebral administration, rectal
administration, sublingual administration, buccal adminis-
tration, and parenteral administration, including injectable
such as intravenous administration, intra-arterial adminis-
tration, intramuscular administration, and subcutaneous
administration, Administration can be continuous or inter-
mittent. In an aspect, the skilled person can determine an
efﬁcacious dose, an eﬂicacious schedule, and an efﬁcacious
route of administration for a disclosed composition or a
disclosed complex so as to treat a subject or inhibit or
prevent an inﬂammatory reaction. In an aspect, the skilled
person can also alter, change, or modify an aspect of an

 

Jan. 31, 2019

administering step so as to improve efﬁcacy of a disclosed
agent or a pharmaceutical preparation comprising a dis-
closed agent.

[0149] As used herein, “modifying the method” can com-
prise modifying or changing one or more features or aspects
of one or more steps of a disclosed method. For example, in
an aspect, a method can be altered by changing the dose or
the amount of a disclosed agent or a pharmaceutical prepa-
ration comprising a disclosed agent, or by changing the
duration or frequency of the administration of a disclosed
agent or pharmaceutical preparation comprising a disclosed
agent.

[0150] As used herein, “growth factors” can refer to
proteins that bind to receptors on the cell surface, with the
primary result of activating cellular proliferation and/or
differentiation. Many growth factors are quite versatile,
stimulating cellular division in numerous different cell
types; while others are speciﬁc to a particular cell-type, The
art is familiar with growth factors, which include, but are not
limited to, ﬁbroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-Z), insulin-like
growth factor-I and -II (IGF-I and IGF-II), platelet derived
growth factor (PDGF), and transforming growth factor-beta
1 (TGF-B).

[0151] As used herein, “bone” can refer to two bone tissue
categories. Cortical bone represents one category while
cancellous bone, which is spongy interior bone tissue,
represents the second category, Cortical bone has a much
higher density than cancellous bone, but it is less porous
(about 5-10% for cortical bone vs. about 50-90% for can-
cellous bone). This means compact bone has fewer spaces
and cavities than spongy bone. Despite these differences,
compact and spongy bone tissue work together as cortical
tissue is the shell that covers the cancellous bone of the
vertebrae and joint ends

[0152] In an aspect, the disclosed cartilage microparticles
can be prepared as follows. Articular cartilage can be
obtained from the articular surfaces of joints, such as from
distal femurs, proximal tibias, acetabulums, heads of femurs,
and/or heads of radiuses, The cartilage can be removed, for
example, with a scalpel blade and can be removed down to
subchondral bone, without removing bone. The articular
cartilage can include articular hyaline cartilage and/or ﬁbro-
cartilage. In an aspect, the cartilage is not subjected to harsh
chemical treatments, which can alter the inherent natural
properties of material within the cartilage. For example, the
cartilage is not subjected to demineralization treatments
such as treatment with hydrochloric acid, ethylene diamine,
and/or other demineralization agents. In an aspect, the
non-demineralized articular cartilage can be subjected to
microbiological testing or can be subjected to other testing
protocols that do not deleteriously alter the cartilage. In an
aspect, the articular cartilage is not subjected to any physical
treatments that may demineralize and/or alter the inherent
natural properties of the cartilage. For example, the articular
cartilage is not subjected to elevated temperatures, e.g.,
temperatures greater than about 50° C., as elevated tempera-
tures can diminish the chondrogenic activity of the cartilage.
However, the articular cartilage can be preserved, e,g.,
freeze-dried, frozen, and/or dried, after being removed from
the joint, In an aspect, a preferred method of preserving
articular cartilage can be freeze-drying,

[0153] In an aspect, the disclosed cartilage microparticles
can be produced by grinding the cartilage. Prior to grinding,
the cartilage can be dry cartilage, freeze-dried cartilage,

frozen cartilage, wet cartilage, or a combination thereof
Pieces of cartilage obtained from the articular surface of one
or more joints can be washed in several changes of normal
saline, blotted dry, and frozen rapidly, e,g., at 10° C./min or
faster, in the vapor phase of liquid nitrogen (about —150° C),
or alternatively, frozen rapidly in the liquid phase of liquid
nitrogen (about —196° C). After being frozen, the cartilage
can be rapidly placed directly on the shelves of a freeze-
drying apparatus maintained at about —40° C. to about —50°
C. (the condenser being cooled to from about —70° C. to
about —80° C.). In an aspect, a vacuum level of less than
about 100 millitorr can be maintained in the freeze-drying
chamber during the freeze-drying cycle, In an aspect, a
vacuum level of about 100 millitorr to about 400 millitorr
can be maintained in the freeze-drying chamber during the
freeze-drying cycle. In an aspect, the freeze-drying cycle can
last an average of about 5 days. In an aspect, during the
initial 30-45 minutes of the cycle, the cartilage can warm
from the initial frozen temperature (erg, about —150° C.) to
the temperature of the freeze-drying chamber (eg, about
—40° C.), after which it can be maintained at about —40° C.
for the remainder of the cycle. In an aspect, the moisture
content of the cartilage can be reduced to from about 4 to
about 5%. Overdrying should be avoided, as this can result
in the irreversible alterations of collagen and proteoglycan
structures. In an aspect, at the end of the freeze-drying cycle,
the chamber can be warmed to room temperature, the
vacuum can be released, and the freeze-dried cartilage can
be removed. The cartilage can be ground using any suitable
grinding apparatus. For example, any grinding apparatus
capable of grinding dry, hard, brittle material in seconds,
such as turbo mills, disc mills, toothed disc mills, jet mills,
or other similar apparatuses can be used,

[0154] In an aspect, grinding can be performed under
conditions that preclude raising the temperature of the
cartilage to a level that can diminish the chondrogenic
activity of the resulting composition. For example, in an
aspect, grinding can be performed without raising the tem-
perature of the articular cartilage above about 50° C. In an
aspect, grinding can be performed without raising the tem-
perature of the cartilage above about 40° C. The temperature
ofthe cartilage can be measured in any suitable manner. For
example, thermocouples can be used to monitor the tem-
perature of the cartilage directly, e,g., by measuring the
temperature of the cartilage immediately after grinding, or
indirectly, eg, by measuring the temperature of the metal in
the grinding mill. Continuous grinding in conventional
grinding mills for 3-5 minutes can raise the temperature of
the material to 70° C. or above. However, operating a
grinding mill intermittently can preclude an undesirable rise
in temperature. In an aspect, freeze-dried pieces of cartilage,
l-4 mm in size, can be ground in a grinding mill operating
intermittently for 20-30 second intervals After each grind-
ing cycle, the cartilage can be sieved. The cartilage can be
sieved through sieves of various sizes. Sieving can be used
to separate cartilage into cartilage powder (i.e., particle sizes
of less than 250 microns) and cartilage granules, Grinding
can be repeated until the desired distribution of particles
sizes can be obtained, such as, for example, from about 50
pm to about 900 pm, See, erg, US, Pat, No, 8,318,212,

[0155] In an aspect, the disclosed bone microparticles can
be prepared as follows. In an aspect, bone can be freeze-
dried and processed, which can include repeated washing in
warm saline or other balanced salt solutions to remove

“undesirable constituents”, In an aspect, the bone can be
immersed directly into liquid nitrogen vapor and can then be
freeze-dried to achieve a residual moisture of 5%-6% or less.
Residual moisture content can be determined gravimetri-
cally. In an aspect, freeze-dried bone can be cut into cubes
with a band saw, an oscillating or a rotary saw without
heating the bone preparation, by avoiding pressure on the
bone being cut, and by limiting the time of grinding to no
more than 15 second for each surface being cut. In an aspect,
cut bone cubes, rectangles, or other small conﬁgurations can
be further cut in a turbo mill, micro hammer cutter mill, disc
mill, toothed disc mill, jet mill, or other similar mills to
obtain particles of a smaller size. In an aspect, dry bone can
be ground, Alternatively, in an aspect, wet bone preparation
can be ground,

[0156] Heating bone above about 45° C. to about 50° C.
can be undesirable as the heat can signiﬁcantly reduce or can
completely abolish osteoinductive properties of bone. For
example, continuous grinding for 3 to 5 minutes in any of the
conventional grinding mills can raise the temperature to 70°
C, or above, Accordingly, in an aspect, a mill can be
operated in cycles of about 8 seconds to about 18 seconds,
then the bone can be sieved a duration of about 14 seconds
to about 15 seconds. In an aspect, the temperature of bone
or grinder can rise above about 33° C. from the initial
temperature ofthe product (e.g., about 18° C. and about 20°
C.). In an aspect, the cycle can operate for no longer than 3
minutes with an average operating time of about 25 min-
utes. In an aspect, after each grinding cycle, the bone can be
sieved. In an aspect, the bone can be sieved through sieves
of various sizes Sieving can be used to separate bone into
bone powder and bone granules. In an aspect, grinding can
be repeated until the desired distribution of particles sizes
can be obtained, such as, for example, from about 20 pm to
about 800 pm, See, erg, US, Pat, No, 7,335,381.

Biological Activity Assays

[0450] The following are assays that may be used to
evaluate the biological efﬁcacy of compounds of Formula

(1)4
GLSl Enzymatic Activity Assay

[0451] The inhibition of puriﬁed recombinant human
GAC by varying concentrations of inhibitors is assessed via
a dual-coupled enzymatic assay. The glutamate produced by
the glutaminase reaction is used by glutamate oxidase to
produce ot-ketoglutarate, ammonia, and hydrogen peroxide,
with this hydrogen peroxide subsequently being used by
horseradish peroxidase to produce resoruﬁn in the presence
ofAmplex UltraRedi The assay buffer consisted of 50 mM
HEPES (pH 7,4), 025 mM EDTA and 01 mM Triton X-100,
GAC was incubated with potassium phosphate (10 minutes
at room temperature) prior to incubation with inhibitor (10
minutes at room temperature), The ﬁnal reaction conditions
were as follows: 2 nM GAC, 50 mM potassium phosphate,
100 mU/ml glutamate oxidase (Sigma), 1 mM glutamine
(Sigma), 100 mU/ml horseradish peroxidase (Sigma), 75 [1M
Arnplex UltraRed (Life Technologies), and 1% (v/v)
DMSO, The production of resoruﬁn was monitored on a
Perkin Elmer Envision plate reader (excitation 530 nm,
emission 590 nm) either in a kinetics or endpoint mode (at
20 minutes), 1CSD values were calculated using a four-
parameter logistic curve ﬁt,

GLSl INHIBITORS FOR TREATING
DISEASE

[0001] This application is a division of US. patent appli-
cation Ser. No. 15/199,100, ﬁled Jun. 30, 2016, which claims
the beneﬁt of priority of United States Provisional Applica-
tion Nos. 62/187,160, ﬁled Jun. 30, 2015, and 62/270,355,
ﬁled Dec, 21, 2015, the disclosures of which are hereby
incorporated by reference as if written herein in their entire-
ties.

BACKGROUND

[0002] The present disclosure relates to new heterocyclic
compounds and compositions, and their application as phar-
maceuticals for the treatment of disease. Methods of inhi-
bition of GLSl activity in a human or animal subject are also
provided for the treatment of diseases such as cancer.
[0003] Metabolic deregulation is a hallmark of cancer as
tumors exhibit an increased demand for nutrients and mac-
romolecules to fuel their rapid pro iferation. Glutamine
(Gln), the most abundant amino acid in circulation, plays an
essential role in providing cancer cells with biosynthetic
intermediates required to support proliferation and survival.
Speciﬁcally, glutaminolysis, or the enzymatic conversion of
glutamine to glutamate, provides pro iferating cancer cells
with a source of nitrogen for amino acid and nucleotide
synthesis, and a carbon skeleton to fuel ATP and NADPH
synthesis through the TCA cycle. In addition to supporting
cell growth, glutamine metabolism p ays a critical role in
maintaining cellular redox homeostasis as glutamate can be
converted into glutathione, the major intracellular antioxi-
dant,
[0004] Glutaminolysis is regulated y mitochondrial glu-
taminase (GLS), the rate limiting enzyme that catalyzes the
conversion of Gln to glutamate and ammonia. Mammalian
cells contain 2 genes that encode glutaminase: the kidney-
type (GLSl) and liver-type (GLSZ) enzymes. Each has been
detected in multiple tissue types, witi GLSl being widely
distributed throughout the body. GuSl is a phosphate-
activated enzyme that exists in humans as two major splice
variants, a long form (referred to as KGA) and a short form
(GAC), which diﬁer only in their C-terminal sequences.
Both forms of (3le are thought to bind to the inner
membrane of the mitochondrion in mammalian cells,
although at least one report suggests that glutaminase may
exist in the intramembrane space, dissociated from the
membrane. GLS is frequently overexpressed in human
tumors and has been shown to be positively regulated by
oncogenes such as Myc. Consistent with the observed
dependence of cancer cell lines on glutamine metabolism,
pharmacological inhibition of GLS oﬂers the potential to
target Gln addicted tumors

[0005] Thus, there is a need for glutaminase inhibitors that
are speciﬁc and capable of being formulated for in vivo use.
[0006] Accordingly, disclosed herein are new composi-
tions and methods for inhibiting glutaminase activity.

ally provided in a single, uniﬁed form, or in multiple forms
(by way of example only, either as a single pill or as two
separate pills).

[0219] In some embodiments, one of the therapeutic
agents is given in multiple doses, or both are given as
multiple doses. If not simultaneous, the timing between the
multiple doses optionally varies from more than zero weeks
to less than twelve weeks.

[0220] In addition, the combination methods, composi-
tions and formulations are not to be limited to the use of only
two agents, the use of multiple therapeutic combinations are
also envisioned. It is understood that the dosage regimen to
treat, prevent, or ameliorate the condition(s) for which relief
is sought, is optionally modiﬁed in accordance with a variety
of factors. These factors include the disorder from which the
subject suﬁers, as well as the age, weight, sex, diet, and
medical condition of the subject Thus, the dosage regimen
actually employed varies widely, in some embodiments, and
therefore deviates from the dosage regimens set forth herein,
[0221] The pharmaceutical agents which make up the
combination therapy disclosed herein are optionally a com-
bined dosage form or in separate dosage forms intended for
substantially simultaneous administration. The phannaceu-
tical agents that make up the combination therapy are
optionally also administered sequentially, with either agent
being administered by a regimen calling for two-step admin-
istration, The two-step administration regimen optionally
calls for sequential administration of the active agents or
spaced-apart administration of the separate active agents,
The time between the multiple administration steps ranges
from a few minutes to several hours, depending upon the
properties of each pharmaceutical agent, such as potency,
solubility, bioavailability, plasma half-life and kinetic proﬁle
of the pharmaceutical agent,

[0222] In another embodiment, a GLSl inhibitor is option-
ally used in combination with procedures that provide
additional beneﬁt to the patient, A GLSl inhibitor and any
additional therapies are optionally administered before, dur-
ing or after the occurrence of a disease or condition, and the
timing of administering the composition containing a GLSl
inhibitor varies in some embodiments. Thus, for example, a
GLSl inhibitor is used as a prophylactic and is administered
continuously to subjects with a propensity to develop con-
ditions or diseases in order to prevent the occurrence of the
disease or condition. A GLSl inhibitor and compositions are
optionally administered to a subject during or as soon as
possible after the onset of the symptoms. While embodi-
ments of the present invention have been shown and
described herein, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art
that such embodiments are provided by way of example
only. Numerous variations, changes, and substitutions will
now occur to those skilled in the art without departing from
the invention. It should be understood that in some embodi-
ments of the invention various alternatives to the embodi-
ments described herein are employed in practicing the
invention,

[0223] A GLSl inhibitor can be used in combination with
anti-cancer drugs, including but not limited to the following
classes: alkylating agents, anti-metabolites, plant alkaloids
and terpenoids, topoisomerase inhibitors, cytotoxic antibi-
otics, angiogenesis inhibitors and tyrosine kinase inhibitors,

pharmaceutically active compounds is selected from the
group consisting of anti-cancer drugs, anti-proliferative
drugs, and anti-inﬂammatory drugs.

[0217] GLSl inhibitor compositions described herein are
also optionally used in combination with other therapeutic
reagents that are selected for their therapeutic value for the
condition to be treated. In general, the compounds described
herein and, in embodiments where combination therapy is
employed, other agents do not have to be administered in the
same pharmaceutical composition and, because of diﬁerent
physical and chemical characteristics, are optionally admin-
istered by different routes, The initial administration is
generally made according to established protocols and then,
based upon the observed eﬁects, the dosage, modes of
administration and times of administration subsequently
modiﬁed, In certain instances, it is appropriate to administer
a GLSl inhibitor compound, as described herein, in com-
bination with another therapeutic agent. By way of example
only, the therapeutic effectiveness of a GLS] inhibitor is
enhanced by administration of another therapeutic agent
(which also includes a therapeutic regimen) that also has
therapeutic beneﬁt. Regardless of the disease, disorder or
condition being treated, the overall beneﬁt experienced by
the patient is either simply additive of the two therapeutic
agents or the patient experiences an enhanced (ire, syner-
gistic) beneﬁt. Alternatively, if a compound disclosed herein
has a side effect, it may be appropriate to administer an agent
to reduce the side eﬁect; or the therapeutic eﬁectiveness of
a compound described herein may be enhanced by admin-
istration of an adjuvant,

[0218] Therapeutically eﬁective dosages vary when the
drugs are used in treatment combinations. Methods for
experimentally determining therapeutically eﬁective dos-
ages of drugs and other agents for use in combination
treatment regimens are documented methodologies, Com-
bination treatment further includes periodic treatments that
start and stop at various times to assist with the clinical
management of the patient In any case, the multiple thera-
peutic agents (one of which is a GLSI inhibitor as described
herein) may be administered in any order, or simultaneously.
If simultaneously, the multiple therapeutic agents are option-

will further recognize that certain groups may be attached to
a parent molecule or may occupy a position in a chain of
elements from either end as written. Thus, by way of
example only, an unsymmetrical group such as 4C(O)N
(R)i may be attached to the parent moiety at either the
carbon or the nitrogen.

[0104] Asymmetric centers exist in the compounds dis-
closed herein. These centers are designated by the symbols
“R” or “S,” depending on the conﬁguration of substituents
around the chiral carbon atom. It should be understood that
the disclosure encompasses all stereochemical isomeric
forms, including diastereomeric, enantiomeric, and epimeric
forms, as well as d-isomers and l-isomers, and mixtures
thereof. Individual stereoisomers of compounds can be
prepared synthetically from commercially available starting
materials which contain chiral centers or by preparation of
mixtures of enantiomeric products followed by separation
such as conversion to a mixture of diastereomers followed
by separation or recrystallization, chromatographic tech-
niques, direct separation of enantiomers on chiral chromato-
graphic columns, or any other appropriate method known in
the art. Starting compounds of particular stereochemistry are
either commercially available or can be made and resolved
by techniques known in the art. Additionally, the compounds
disclosed herein may exist as geometric isomers. The pres-
ent disclosure includes all cis, trans, syn, anti, entgegen (E),
and zusammen (Z) isomers as well as the appropriate
mixtures thereof. Additionally, compounds may exist as
tautomers, all tautomerlc isomers are provided by this
disclosure. Additionally, the compounds disclosed herein
can exist in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with
pharmaceutically acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol,
and the like. In general. the solvated forms are considered
equivalent to the unsolvated forms.

[0105] The term “bond" refers to a covalent linkage
between two atoms, or two moieties when the atoms joined
by the bond are considered part of larger substructure. A
bond may be single, double, or triple unless otherwise
speciﬁed. A dashed line between two atoms in a drawing of
a molecule indicates that an additional bond may be present
or absent at that position.

[0106] The term “disease” as used herein is intended to be
generally synonymous, and is used interchangeably with, the
terms “disorder," “syndrome,” and “condition” (as in medi-
cal condition), in that all reﬂect an abnormal condition of the
human or animal body or of one of its parts that impairs
normal functioning, is typically manifested by distinguish-
ing signs and symptoms, and causes the human or animal to
have a reduced duration or quality of life.

[0107] The term “combination therapy” means the admin-
istration of two or more therapeutic agents to treat a thera-
peutic condition or disorder described in the present disclo-
sure. Such administration encompasses co-adrninistration of
these therapeutic agents in a substantially simultaneous
manner, such as in a single capsule having a ﬁxed ratio of
active ingredients or in multiple, separate capsules for each
active ingredient. In addition, such administration also
encompasses use of each type of therapeutic agent in a
sequential manner. In either case, the treatment regimen will
provide beneﬁcial effects of the drug combination in treating
the conditions or disorders described herein.

[0108] GLSl inhibitor is used herein to refer to a com-
pound that exhibits an ICSO with respect to GLSl activity of
no more than about 100 uM and more typically not more

Jan. 31, 2019

than about 50 M, as measured in the GLSl enzyme assay
described generally herein below. ICSO is that concentration
of inhibitor that reduces the activity of an enzyme (e.g.,
GLSl) to half-maximal level. Certain compounds disclosed
herein have been discovered to exhibit inhibition against
GLSl. In certain embodiments, compounds will exhibit an
1C5D with respect to GLSl ofno more than about 10 M; in
further embodiments, compounds will exhibit an IC50 with
respect to Gle of no more than about 5 uM; in yet further
embodiments, compounds will exhibit an ICSO with respect
to GLSl of not more than about 1 nM, in yet further
embodiments, compounds will exhibit an ICso with respect
to GLSI of not more than about 200 nM, as measured in the
GLSl binding assay described herein.

[0109] The phrase “therapeutically eﬁective” is intended
to qualify the amount of active ingredients used in the
treatment of a disease or disorder or on the etfecting of a
clinical endpoint.

[0110] The term “therapeutically acceptable” refers to
those compounds (or salts, prodrugs, tautomers, zwitterionic
forms, etc.) which are suitable for use in contact with the
tissues of patients without undue toxicity, irritation, and
allergic response, are commensurate with a reasonable ben-
eﬁt/risk ratio, and are eﬁective for their intended use.
[0111] As used herein, reference to “treatment” of a patient
is intended to include prophylaxis. Treatment may also be
preemptive in nature, i.e., it may include prevention of
disease. Prevention of a disease may involve complete
protection from disease, for example as in the case of
prevention of infection with a pathogen, or may involve
prevention of disease progression. For example, prevention
of a disease may not mean complete foreclosure of any effect
related to the diseases at any level, but instead may mean
prevention of the symptoms of a disease to a clinically
signiﬁcant or detectable level. Prevention of diseases may
also mean prevention of progression of a disease to a later
stage of the disease.

[0112] The term “patient” is generally synonymous with
the term “subject” and includes all mammals including
humans. Examples of patients include humans, livestock
such as cows, goats, sheep. pigs, and rabbits, and companion
animals such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and horses. Preferably,
the patient is a human.

[0113] The temi “prodrug” refers to a compound that is
made more active in vivo. Certain compounds disclosed
herein may also exist as prodrugs, as described in Hydrolysis
in Drug and Prodrug Metabolism: Chemistry, Biochemistry,
and Enzymology (Testa, Bernard and Mayer, Joachim M.
Wiley-VHCA, Zurich, Switzerland 2003). Prodrugs of the
compounds described herein are structurally modiﬁed forms
of the compound that readily undergo chemical changes
under physiological conditions to provide the compound.
Additionally, prodrugs can be converted to the compound by
chemical or biochemical methods in an ex vivo environ-
ment. For example, prodrugs can be slowly converted to a
compound when placed in a transdennal patch reservoir
with a suitable enzyme or chemical reagent. Prodrugs are
often useful because, in some situations, they may be easier
to administer than the compound, or parent drug. They may,
for instance, be bioavailable by oral administration whereas
the parent drug is not. The prodrug may also have improved
solubility in pharmaceutical compositions over the parent
drug. A wide variety of prodrug derivatives are known in the
art, such as those that rely on hydrolytic cleavage or oxida-

thereof, together with one or more pharrnaceutically accept-
able carriers thereof and optionally one or more other
therapeutic ingredients. The carrier(s) must be “acceptable”
in the sense of being compatible with the other ingredients
of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient
thereof Proper formulation is dependent upon the route of
administration chosen. Any of the well-known techniques,
carriers, and excipients may be used as suitable and as
understood in the art; e.g., in Remington’s Pharmaceutical
Sciences. The pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein
may be manufactured in any manner known in the art, e.g.,
by means of conventional mixing, dissolving, granulating,
dragee-making, levigating, emulsifying, encapsulating,
entrapping or compression processes.

[0179] The formulations include those suitable for oral,
parenteral (including subcutaneous, intradermal, intramus-
cular, intravenous, intraarticular, and intramedullary), intra-
peritoneal, transmucosal, transdermal, rectal and topical
(including dermal, buccal, sublingual and intraocular)
administration although the most suitable route may depend
upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient.
The formulations may conveniently be presented in unit
dosage form and may be prepared by any of the methods
well known in the art of pharmacy. Typically, these methods
include the step of bringing into association a compound of
the subject disclosure or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt,
ester. amide, prodrug or solvate thereof (“active ingredient”)
with the carrier which constitutes one or more accessory
ingredients. In general, the formulations are prepared by
uniformly and intimately bringing into association the active
ingredient with liquid carriers or ﬁnely divided solid carriers
or both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the
desired formulation

[0180] Compounds described herein can be administered
as follows:

Oral Administration

[0181] The compounds of the present invention may be
administered orally, including swallowing, so the compound
enters the gastrointestinal tract, or is absorbed into the blood
stream directly from the mouth, including sublingual or
buccal administration.

[0182] Suitable compositions for oral administration
include solid formulations such as tablets, pills, cachets,
lozenges and ard or soft capsules, which can contain
liquids, gels, powders, or granules.

[0183] In a tablet or capsule dosage form the amount of
drug present may be from about 0.05% to about 95% by
weight, more typically from about 2% to about 50% by
weight of the cosage form.

[0184] In addition, tablets or capsules may contain a
disintegrant, comprising from about 05% to about 35% by
weight, more typically from about 2% to about 25% of the
dosage form. Examples of disintegrants include methyl
cellulose, sodium or calcium carboxymethyl cellulose, cros-
carmellose sodium, polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropyl
cellulose, starci and the like.

[0185] Suitable binders, for use in a tablet, include gelatin,
polyethylene gycol, sugars, gums, starch, hydroxypropyl
cellulose and the like. Suitable diluents, for use in a tablet,
include mannitol, xylitol, lactose, dextrose, sucrose, sorbitol
and starch.
[0186] Suitable surface active agents and glidants, for use
in a tablet or ca sule, may be present in amounts from about

 

Jan. 31, 2019

0.1% to about 3% by weight, and include polysorbate 80,
sodium dodecyl sulfate, talc and silicon dioxide.

[0187] Suitable lubricants, for use in a tablet or capsule,
may be present in amounts from about 0.1% to about 5% by
weight, and include calcium, zinc or magnesium stearate,
sodium stearyl fumarate and the like.

[0188] Tablets may be made by compression or molding,
optionally with one or more accessory ingredients. Com-
pressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable
machine the active ingredient in a free-ﬂowing form such as
a powder or granules, optionally mixed with binders, inert
diluents, or lubricating, surface active or dispersing agents.
Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable
machine a mixture of the powdered compound moistened
with a liquid diluent. Dyes or pigments may be added to
tablets for identiﬁcation or to characterize different combi-
nations of active compound doses.

[0189] Liquid formulations can include emulsions, solu-
tions, syrups, elixirs and suspensions, which can be used in
soft or hard capsules. Such formulations may include a
pharrnaceutically acceptable carrier, for example, water,
ethanol, polyethylene glycol, cellulose, or an oil. The for-
mulation may also include one or more emulsifying agents
and/or suspending agents.

[0190] Compositions for oral administration may be for-
mulated as immediate or modiﬁed release, including delayed
or sustained release, optionally with enteric coating
[0191] In another embodiment, a pharmaceutical compo-
sition comprises a therapeutically eifective amount of a
compound of Formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof, and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.

Parenteral Administration

[0192] Compounds of the present invention may be
administered directly into the blood stream, muscle, or
internal organs by injection, e.g., by bolus injection or
continuous infusion. Suitable means for parenteral admin-
istration include intravenous, intra-muscular, subcutaneous
intraarterial, intraperitoneal, intrathecal, intracranial, and the
like. Suitable devices for parenteral administration include
injectors (including needle and needle-free injectors) and
infusion methods. The formulations may be presented in
unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example sealed
ampoules and vials.

[0193] Most parenteral formulations are aqueous solutions
containing excipients, including salts, buffering, suspending,
stabilizing and/or dispersing agents, antioxidants, bacte-
riostats, preservatives, and solutes which render the formu-
lation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient, and
carbohydrates.

[0194] Parenteral formulations may also be prepared in a
dehydrated form (e.g., by lyophilization) or as sterile non-
aqueous solutions. These formulations can be used with a
suitable vehicle, such as sterile water. Solubility-enhancing
agents may also be used in preparation of parenteral solu-
tions.

[0195] Compositions for parenteral administration may be
formulated as immediate or modiﬁed release, including
delayed or sustained release. Compounds may also be for-
mulated as depot preparations. Such long acting formula-
tions may be administered by implantation (for example
subcutaneously or intramuscularly) or by intramuscular
injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be for-
mulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials

that glutaminase inhibition may be beneﬁcial in the treat-
ment of schizophrenia (Gaisler-Salomon et al., Neuropsy-
chopharmacology, 2009), Bipolar disorder is a devastating
illness that is marked by recurrent episodes of mania and
depression. This disease is treated with mood stabilizers
such as lithium and valproate; however, chronic use of these
drugs appear to increase the abundance of glutamate recep-
tors (Nanavati et al,, J , Neurochem,, 2011), which may lead
to a decrease in the drug’s effectiveness over time. Thus, an
alternative treatment may be to reduce the amount of glu-
tamate by inhibiting glutaminase, This may or may not be in
conjunction with the mood stabilizers. Memantine, a partial
antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR), is
an approved therapeutic in the treatment of Alzheimer’s
disease. Currently, research is being conducted looking at
memantine as a means of treating vascular dementia and
Parkinson’s disease (Oliverares et al., Curr. Alzheimer Res,,
2011). Since memantine has been shown to partially block
the NMDA glutamate receptor also, it is not unreasonable to
speculate that decreasing glutamate levels by inhibiting
glutaminase could also treat Alzheimer’s disease, vascular
dementia and Parkinson’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease,
bipolar disorder, HIV-associated dementia, Huntington’s
disease, ischemic insult, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia,
stroke, traumatic insult and vascular dementia are but a few
of the neurological diseases that have been correlated to
increased levels of glutamate, Thus, inhibiting glutaminase
with a compound described herein can reduce or prevent
neurological diseases. Therefore, in certain embodiments,
the compounds may be used for the treatment or prevention
of neurological diseases.

Immunological Disorders

[0207] In some embodiments, the compounds and phar-
maceutical compositions of the present disclosure may be
useful in the treatment or prevention of immunological
diseases,

[0208] Activation of '1' lymphocytes induces cell growth,
proliferation, and cytokine production, thereby placing ener-
getic and biosynthetic demands on the cell, Glutamine
serves as an amine group donor for nucleotide synthesis, and
glutamate, the ﬁrst component in glutamine metabolism,
plays a direct role in amino acid and glutathione synthesis,
as well as being able to enter the Krebs cycle for energy
production (Carr et al., J. Immunol., 2010). Mitogen-in-
duced T cell proliferation and cytokine production require
high levels of glutamine metabolism, thus inhibiting gluta-
minase may serve as a means of immune modulation, In
multiple sclerosis, an inﬂammatory autoimmune disease, the
activated microglia exhibit up-regulated glutaminase and
release increased levels of extracellular glutamate, Gluta-
mine levels are lowered by sepsis. injury, burns, surgery and
endurance exercise (Calder et al,, Amino Acids, 1999),
These situations put the individual at risk of immunosup-
pression. In fact, in general, glutaminase gene expression
and enzyme activity are both increased during T cell activity,
Patients given glutamine following bone marrow transplan-
tation resulted in a lower level of infection and reduced graﬁ
v. host disease (Crowther, Proc. Nutr, Soc,, 2009). T cell
proliferation and activation is involved in many immuno-
logical diseases, such as inﬁammatory bowel disease,
Crohn’s disease, sepsis, psoriasis, arthritis (including rheu-
matoid arthritis), multiple sclerosis, gralt v, host disease,
infections, lupus and diabetes, In an embodiment of the

Jan. 3], 2019

invention, the compounds described herein can be used to
treat or prevent immunological diseases.

Cancer

[0209] In some embodiments, the compounds and phar-
maceutical compositions of the present disclosure may be
useful in the treatment or prevention of cancer,

[0210] In addition to serving as the basic building blocks
of protein synthesis, amino acids have been shown to
contribute to many processes critical for growing and divid-
ing cells, and this is particularly true for cancer cells. Nearly
all deﬁnitions of cancer include reference to dysregulated
proliferation, Numerous studies on glutamine metabolism in
cancer indicate that many tumors are avid glutamine con-
sumers (Souba, Ann. Surg,, 1993; Collins et al,, J, Cell.
Physiol,, 1998; Medina, J, Nutr., 2001; Shanware et al,, J.
Mol, Med,, 2011), An embodiment of the invention is the
use of the compounds described herein for the treatment of
cancer.

under the deﬁnition of substituted aminor Examples include
trimethysilyl, tert-butyldimethylsilyl, triphenylsilyl and the
like.

[0100] Any deﬁnition herein may be used in combination
with any other deﬁnition to describe a composite structural
group. By convention, the trailing element of any such
deﬁnition is that which attaches to the parent moietyr For
example, the composite group alkylamido would represent
an alkyl group attached to the parent molecule through an
amide group, and the term alkoxyalkyl would represent an
alkoxy group attached to the parent molecule through an
alkyl group.

[0101] When a group is deﬁned to be “null," what is meant
is that the group is absent.

[0102] The term “optionally substituted” means the ante-
ceding group may be substituted or unsubstituted. When
substituted, the substituents of an “optionally substituted"
group may include, without limitation, one or more sub-
stituents independently selected from the following groups
or a particular designated set of groups, alone or in combi-
nation: lower alkyl, lower alkenyl, lower alkynyl, lower

haloalkylthio, arylthio, sulfonate, sulfonic acid, trisubsti-
tuted silyl, N3, SH, SCH3, C(O)CHS, COZCHS, COzH,
pyridinyl, thiophene, furanyl, lower carbamate, and lower
urea. Two substituents may be joined together to form a
fused ﬁve-, six-, or seven-membered carbocyclic or hetero-
cyclic ring consisting of zero to three heteroatoms, for
example forming methylenedioxy or ethylenedioxy. An
optionally substituted group may be unsubstituted (e.g.,
ACHZCH3), fully substituted (e.g., %F2CF3), monosub-
stituted (e.g., ACHZCHZF) or substituted at a level any-
where in-between fully substituted and monosubstituted
(erg, ACHZCFE) Where substituents are recited without
qualiﬁcation as to substitution, both substituted and unsub-
stituted forms are encompassed. Where a substituent is
qualiﬁed as “substituted,” the substituted form is speciﬁcally
intended. Additionally, different sets of optional substituents
to a particular moiety may be deﬁned as needed; in these
cases, the optional substitution will be as deﬁned, oﬁen
immediately following the phrase, “optionally substituted
with.”

[0103] The term R or the term R‘, appearing by itself and
without a number designation, unless otherwise deﬁned,
refers to a moiety selected from the group consisting of
hydrogen, alkyl, cycloalkyl, heteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl and
heterocycloalkyl, any of which may be optionally substi-
tuted. Such R and R‘ groups should be understood to be
optionally substituted as deﬁned herein. Whether an R group
has a number designation or not, every R group, including
R, R‘ and R" where n:(l, 2, 3, . . .n), every substituent, and
every term should be understood to be independent of every
other in terms of selection from a group. Should any
variable, substituent, or term (e.gr, aryl, heterocycle, R, etc.)
occur more than one time in a formula or generic structure,
its deﬁnition at each occurrence is independent of the
deﬁnition at every other occurrence. Those of skill in the art

exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for
example, as a sparingly soluble salt.

Methods of Treatment

[0203] The present disclosure provides compounds and
pharmaceutical compositions that inhibit glutaminase activ-
ity, particularly GLS] activity and are thus useful in the
treatment or prevention of disorders associated with GLS].
Compounds and pharmaceutical compositions of the present
disclosure selectively modulate GLSl and are thus useful in
the treatment or prevention of a range of disorders associ-
ated with GLSl and include, but are not limited to, cancer,
immunological or neurological diseases associated with
GLS1.

Neurological Disorders

[0204] In some embodiments, the compounds and phar-
maceutical compositions of the present disclosure may be
useful in the treatment or prevention of neurological dis-

[0205] The most common neurotransmitter is glutamate,
derived from the enzymatic conversion of glutamine via
glutaminase, High levels of glutamate have been shown to
be neurotoxic. Following traumatic insult to neuronal cells,
there occurs a rise in neurotransmitter release, particularly
glutamate, Accordingly, inhibition of glutaminase has been
hypothesized as a means of treatment following an ischemic
insult, such as stroke.

[0206] Huntington’s disease is a progressive, fatal neuro-
logical condition, In genetic mouse models of Huntington's
disease, it was observed that the early manifestation of the
disease correlated with dysregulated glutamate release (Ray-
mond et al., Neuroscience, 2011), In HIV-associated demen-
tia, HIV infected macrophages exhibit upregulated glutami-
nase activity and increased glutamate release, leading to
neuronal damage (Huang et al., J. Neurosci,, 2011). Simi-
larly, in another neurological disease, the activated micro glia
in Rett Syndrome release glutamate causing neuronal dam-
age, The release of excess glutamate has been associated
with the up-regulation of glutaminase (Maezawa et al., J.
Neurosci, 2010). In mice bred to have reduced glutaminase
levels, sensitivity to psychotic-stimulating drugs, such as
amphetamines, was dramatically reduced, thus suggesting

[0413] A vial (20 ml, teﬂon septa) was charged with

2-(6-methylpyridin-2-yl)acetamide (200 mg, 1.33 mmol),
3-chloro-6-iodopyridazine (352 mg, 1.46 mmol), cesium
carbonate (868 mg, 2.66 mmol), allylpalladium chloride
dimer (24 mg, 0.067 mmol), Xantphos (154 mg, 0.266
mmol), and Dioxane (6.6 ml). The mixture was degassed by
bubbling N2 through the suspension for 5 min and then
heated at 50° C. with stirring for 12 hrs, The reaction was
ﬁltered and the volatiles were removed under reduced pres-
sure. The residue was puriﬁed via silica gel chromatography
(0-100% EtOAc (with 10% MeOH) in hexanes) to give the
title compound (283 mg, 81%) as a brown amorphous
material. MS (ES+) C12H11C1N4O requires: 262, found: 285

[0126] 5. Uses, Formulations, Administration

[0127] Pharmaceutical Uses; Indications

[0128] This invention provides compounds having bio-
logical properties which make them of interest for treating or
ameliorating diseases in which kinases may be involved,
symptoms of such disease, or the effect of other physiologi-
cal events mediated by kinases. For instance, a number of
compounds of this invention have been shown to inhibit
tyrosine kinase activity of Src and ab], among other tyrosine
kinases which are believed to mediate the growth, develop-
ment and/or metastasis of cancer A number of compounds
of the invention have also been found to possess potent in
vitro activity against cancer cell lines, including among
others K-562 leukemia cells. Observed potencies have been
as much as 10-fold more powerful than Gleevec in conven-
tional antiproliferation assays with K562 cells,

[0129] Such compounds are thus of interest for the treat-
ment of cancers, including both primary and metastatic
cancers, including solid tlunors as well as lymphomas and

leukemias (including CML, AML and ALL), and including
cancers which are resistant to other therapies, including
other therapies involving the administration of kinase inhibi-
tors such as Gleevec, Tarceva or lressa.

[0130] Such cancers include, among others, cancers of the
breast, cervix, colon and rectum, lung, ovaries, pancreas,
prostate, head and neck, gastrointestinal stroma, as well as
diseases such as melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodg-
kin’s lymphoma, melanoma, gastric cancers and leukemias
(e.g., myeloid, lymphocytic, myelocytic and lymphoblastic
leukemias) including cases which are resistant to one or
more other therapies, including among others, Gleevec,
Tarceva or lressa.

[0131] Resistance to various anticancer agents can arise
from one or more mutations in a mediator or effector of the
cancer (e.g., mutation in a kinase such as Src or Abl) which
correlate with alteration in the protein’s drug binding prop-
erties, phosphate binding properties, protein binding prop-
erties, autoregulation or other characteristics. For example,
in the case of BCR-Abl, the kinase associated with chronic
myeloid leukemia, resistance to Gleevec has been mapped to
a variety of BCR/Abl mutations which are linked to a variety
of functional consequences, including among others, steric
hindrance of drug occupancy at the kinase’s active site,
alteration in deformability of the phosphate binding P loop,
effects on the conformation of the activation loop surround-
ing the active site, and others. See eg Shah et a1, 2002,
Cancer Cell 2, 117-125 and Azam et al, 2003, Cell 112,
831-843 and references cited therein for representative
examples of such mutations in Bcr/Abl which correlate with
drug resistance. See also the following references for addi-
tional background information on BCR/Abl, its mechanistic

[0132] Again, we contemplate that compounds of this
invention, both as monotherapies and in combination thera-
pies, will be useful against leukemias and other cancers,
including those which are resistant in whole or part to other
anticancer agents, speciﬁcally including Gleevec and other
kinase inhibitors, and speciﬁcally including leukemias
involving one or more mutations in BCR/Abl, within or
outside the kinase domain, including but not limited to those
noted in any of the foregoing publications. See in particular
Azam et al, and references cited therein for examples of such
mutations in BCR/Abl, including, among others, mutations
in the drug binding cleft, the phosphate binding P loop, the
activation loop, the conserved VAVK of the kinase beta-3
sheet, the catalytic alpha-1 helix of the small N lobe, the
long alpha-3 helix within the large C lobe, and the region
within the C lobe downstream of the activation loop.

[0135] A “therapeutically effective amount” is that amount
effective for detectable killing or inhibition of the growth or
spread of cancer cells; the size or number of tumors; or other
measure of the level, stage, progression or severity of the
cancer. The exact amount required will vary from subject to
subject, depending on the species, age, and general condi-
tion of the subject, the severity of the disease, the particular
anticancer agent, its mode of administration, combination
treatment with other therapies, and the like.

[0136] The compound, or a composition containing the
compound, may be administered using any amount and any
route of administration effective for killing or inhibiting the
growth of tumors or other forms of cancer

[0137] The anticancer compounds of the invention are
preferably formulated in dosage unit form for ease of
administration and uniformity of dosage: The expression

will be decided by the attending physician using routine
reliance upon sound medical judgment. The speciﬁc thera-
peutically effective dose level for any particular patient or
organism will depend upon a variety of factors including the
disorder being treated; the severity of the disorder; the
potency of the speciﬁc compound employed; the speciﬁc
composition employed; the age, body weight, general
health, sex and diet of the patient; the route and schedule of
administration; the rate of metabolism and/or excretion of
the compound; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in
combination or coincident with administration of the com-
pound of this invention; and like factors well known in the
medical arts.

[0138] Furthermore, aﬁer formulation with an appropriate
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier in a desired dosage, the
compositions of this invention can be administered to
humans and other animals orally, rectally, parenterally, intra-
cisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by
transdermal patch, powders, ointments, or drops), sublin-
gually, bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like,

[0139] The effective systemic dose of the compound will
typically be in the range of 0.01 to 500 mg of compound per
kg of patient body weight, preferably 0.1 to 125 mg/kg, and
in some cases 1 to 25 mg/kg, administered in single or
multiple doses Generally. the compound may be adminis-
tered to patients in need of such treatment in a daily dose
range of about 50 to about 2000 mg per patient, Adminis-
tration may be once or multiple times daily, weekly (or at
some other multiple-day interval) or on an intermittent
schedule. For example, the compound may be administered
one or more times per day on a weekly basis (e.g. every
Monday) Indeﬁnitely or for a period of weeks, e.g. 4-10
weeks, Alternatively, it may be administered daily for a
period ofdays (erg. 2-10 days) followed by a period of days
(e.gi, 1-30 days) without administration of the compound,
with that cycle repeated indeﬁnitely or for a given number
of repetitions, e.g. 4-10 cycles. As an example, a compound
of the invention may be administered daily for 5 days. then
discontinued for 9 days, then administered daily for another
5 day period, then discontinued for 9 days, and so on,
repeating the cycle indeﬁnitely, or for a total of 4-10 times,

[0140] The amount of compound which will be effective
in the treatment or prevention of a particular disorder or
condition will depend in part on well known factors affecting
drug dosage. In addition, in vitro or in vivo assays may
optionally be employed to help identify optimal dosage
ranges. Arough guide to effective doses may be extrapolated
from dose-response curves derived from in vitro or animal
model test systems. The precise dosage level should be
determined by the attending physician or other health care
provider and will depend upon well known factors, includ-
ing route of administration, and the age, body weight, sex
and general health of the individual; the nature, severity and
clinical stage of the disease: the use (or not) of concomitant
therapies; and the nature and extent of genetic engineering
of cells in the patient.

[0141] When administered for the treatment or inhibition
of a particular disease state or disorder, the effective dosage
of the compound of this Invention may vary depending upon
the particular compound utilized, the mode of administra-
tion, the condition, and severity thereof, of the condition
being treated, as well as the various physical factors related
to the individual being treated. In many cases, satisfactory
results may be obtained when the compound is administered

Jan. 31, 2019

in a daily dosage of from about 001 mg/kg-SOO mg/kg,
preferably between 0.1 and 125 mykg, and more preferably
between 1 and 25 mg/kg. The projected daily dosages are
expected to vary with route of administration Thus, paren-
teral dosing will often be at levels of roughly 10% to 20%
of oral dosing levels,

[0142] When the compound of this invention is used as
part of a combination regimen, dosages of each of the
components of the combination are administered during a
desired treatment period. The components of the combina-
tion may administered at the same time; either as a unitary
dosage form containing both components. or as separate
dosage units; the components of the combination can also be
administered at different times during a treatment period, or
one may be administered as a pretreatment for the other

[0143] Regarding the Compounds

[0144] Compounds of present invention can exist in free
form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a pharmaceu-
tically acceptable salt or other derivative. As used herein, the
term “pharmaceutically acceptable salt” refers to those salts
which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment,
suitable for use in contact with the tissues of humans and
lower animals without undue toxicity, irritation, allergic
response and the like, and are commensurate with a reason-
able beneﬁt/risk ratio, Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of

compounds, are well known in the art, For example, S, M.
Berge, et al, describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in
detail in .1. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 66:1-19 (1977), incor-
porated herein by reference. The salts can be prepared in situ
during the isolation and puriﬁcation of the compounds of the
invention, or separately by reacting the free base or free acid
of a compound of the invention with a suitable base or acid,
respectively, Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable, non-
toxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed
with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic
acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and perchloric acid or
with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic
acid, tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid
or by using other methods used in the art such as ion
exchange Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include
adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate,
benzoate, bisulfate, borate, butyrate, camphorate, camphor-
sulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate,

[0150] Formulations

[0151] This invention also encompasses a class of com-
positions comprising the active compounds of this invention
in association with one or more pharmaceutically-acceptable
carriers and/or diluents and/or adjuvants (collectively
referred to herein as “carrier” materials) and, if desired,
other active ingredients. The active compounds of the pres-
ent invention may be administered by any suitable route,
preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition
adapted to such a route, and in a dose effective for the
treatment intended. The compounds and compositions of the
present invention may, for example, be administered orally,
mucosally, topically, rectally, pulmonarily such as by inha-
lation spray, or parentally including intravascularly, intra-
venously, intraperitoneally, subcutaneously, intramuscularly,
intrasternally and infusion techniques, in dosage unit for-
mulations containing conventional pharmaceutically accept-
able carriers, adjuvants, and vehicles.

[0152] The pharmaceutically active compounds of this
invention can be processed in accordance with conventional
methods of pharmacy to produce medicinal agents for
administration to patients, including humans and other
mammals

[0153] For oral administration, the pharmaceutical com-
position may be in the form of, for example, a tablet,
capsule, suspension or liquid. The pharmaceutical compo-
sition is preferably made in the form of a dosage unit
containing a particular amount of the active ingredient.
[0154] Examples of such dosage units are tablets or cap-
sules. For example, these may contain an amount of active
ingredient from about 1 to 2000 mg, preferably from about
1 to 500 mg, more commonly from about 5 to 200 mg. A
suitable daily dose for a human or other mammal may vary
depending on the condition of the patient and other factors,
but, once again, can be determined using routine methods.
[0155] The amount of compounds which are administered
and the dosage regimen for treating a disease condition with
the compounds and/or compositions of this invention
depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight,
sex and medical condition of the subject, the type of disease,
the severity of the disease, the route and frequency of
administration, and the particular compound employed,
Thus, the dosage regimen may vary widely, but can be
determined routinely using standard methods. A typical
daily dose is in the range of0.01 to 500 mg ofcompound per
kg body weight, preferably between 0.1 and 125 mg/kg body
weight and in some cases between 1 and 25 mg/kg body

[0117] In this scheme, non limiting examples of substitu-
ents Rb on Ring B are halo, egi, Cl; lower alkyl groups, eg.,
isopropyl; and substituted lower alkyl groups, eg ACFs,
and non limiting examples of Ring D are N,N-dimethylpyr—
rolidine. N-(2-hydroxyethyl)piperazine, and N-methylpip-
erazine,

[0118] Intermediates W—[Ring A]-[L‘]-[Ring B], such as
those presented in the various synthetic schemes above, can
be reacted with an acetylenic Ring T using the Sonogashira
coupling conditions described in the general Scheme It

weight. As mentioned previously, the daily dose can be
given in one administration or may be divided between 2, 3,
4 or more administrations.

[0156] For therapeutic purposes, the active compounds of
this invention are ordinarily combined with one or more
adjuvants, excipients or carriers appropriate to the indicated
route of administration If administered per os, the com-
pounds may be admixed with lactose, sucrose, starch pow-
der, cellulose esters of alkanoic acids, cellulose alkyl esters,
talc, stearic acid, magnesium stearate, magnesium oxide,
sodium and calcium salts of phosphoric and sulfuric acids,
gelatin, acacia gum, sodium alginate, polyvinylpyrrolidone,
and/or polyvinyl alcohol, and then tableted or encapsulated
for convenient administration. Such capsules or tablets may
contain a controlled-release formulation as may be provided
in a dispersion of active compound in hydroxypropylmethyl
cellulose. In the case of skin conditions, it may be preferable
to apply a topical preparation of compounds of this inven-
tion to the affected area two to four times a day Formulations
suitable for topical administration include liquid or semi-
liquid preparations suitable for penetration through the skin
(e.g., liniments, lotions, ointments, creams, or pastes) and
drops suitable for administration to the eye, ear, or nose, A
suitable topical dose of active ingredient of a compound of
the invention is 0.1 mg to 150 mg administered one to four,
preferably one or two times daily. For topical administration,
the active ingredient may comprise from 0.001% to 10%
w/w, e.g., from 1% to 2% by weight of the formulation,
although it may comprise as much as 10% w/w, but pref-
erably not more than 5% W/w, and more preferably from
0.1% to 1% of the formulation.

[0157] When formulated in an ointment, the active ingre-
dients may be employed with either parafﬁnic or a water-
miscible ointment base. Alternatively, the active ingredients
may be formulated in a cream with an oil-in-water cream
base. If desired, the aqueous phase of the cream base may
include, for example at Least 30% w/w of a polyhydric
alcohol such as propylene glycol, butane-1,3-diol, mannitol,
sorbitol, glycerol, polyethylene glycol and mixtures thereof
The topical formulation may desirably include a compound
which enhances absorption or penetration of the active
ingredient through the skin or other affected areas. Examples
of such dermal penetration enhancers include dimethylsul-
foxide and related analogs.

[0158] The compounds of this invention can also be
administered by a transdermal device. Preferably transder-
mal administration will be accomplished using a patch either
of the reservoir and porous membrane type or of a solid
matrix variety. In either case, the active agent is delivered-
continuously from the reservoir or microcapsules through a
membrane into the active agent permeable adhesive, which
is in contact with the skin or mucosa of the recipient. If the
active agent is absorbed through the skin, a controlled and
predetermined ﬂow of the active agent is administered to the
recipient. In the case of microcapsules, the encapsulating
agent may also function as the membrane. The oily phase of
the emulsions of this invention may be constituted from
known Ingredients in a known manner.

[0159] While the phase may comprise merely an emulsi-
ﬁer, it may comprise a mixture of at least one emulsiﬁer with
a fat or an oil or with both a fat and an oil. Preferably, a
hydrophilic emulsiﬁer is included together with a lipophilic
emulsiﬁer which acts as a stabilizer. It is also preferred to
include both an oil and a fat. Together, the emulsifier(s) with

Jan. 31, 2019

or without stabilizer(s) make-up the so-called emulsifying
wax, and the wax together with the oil and fat make up the
so-called emulsifying ointment base which forms the oily
dispersed phase of the cream formulations. Emulsiﬁers and
emulsion stabilizers suitable for use in the formulation of the
present invention include Tween 60. Span 80, cetostearyl
alcohol, myristyl alcohol, glyceryl monostearate, sodium
lauryl sulfate, glyceryl distearate alone or with a wax, or
other materials well known in tie art.

[0160] The choice of suitable oils or fats for the formu-
lation is based on achieving the desired cosmetic properties,
since the solubility of the active compound in most oils
likely to be used in pharmaceutical emulsion formulations is
very low Thus, the cream shoul preferably be a non-greasy,
non-staining and washable product with suitable consistency
to avoid leakage from tubes or other containers. Straight or
branched chain, mono- or di asic alkyl esters such as
di-isoadipate, isocetyl stearate, propylene glycol diester of
coconut fatty acids, isopropyl myristate, decyl oleate, iso-
propyl palmitate. butyl stearate, 2-ethylhexyl palmitate or a
blend of branched chain esters may be used. These may be
used alone or in combination cepending on the properties
required.
[0161] Alternatively. high melting point lipids such as
white soft paraﬂin and/or liquid araﬂin or other mineral oils
can be used.
[0162] Formulations suitable or topical administration to
the eye also include eye drops w 1erein the active ingredients
are dissolved or suspended in suitable carrier, especially an
aqueous solvent for the active ingredients.

[0163] The active ingredients are preferably present in
such formulations in a concentration of 0.5 to 20%, advan-
tageously 0.5 to 10% and particularly about 1.5% w/w.

[0164] Formulations for parenteral administration may be
in the form of aqueous or non-aqueous isotonic sterile
injection solutions or suspensions. These solutions and sus-
pensions may be prepared from sterile powders or granules
using one or more of the carriers or diluents mentioned for
use in the formulations for oral administration or by using
other suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending
agents, The compounds may be dissolved in water, polyeth-
ylene glycol, propylene glycol, ethanol, corn oil, cottonseed
oil, peanut oil, sesame oil, benzyl alcohol, sodium chloride,
tragacanth gum, and/or various buffers. Other adjuvants and
modes of administration are well and widely known in the
pharmaceutical art, The active ingredient may also be
administered by injection as a composition with suitable
carriers including saline, dextrose, or water, or with cyclo-
dextrin (i .e. Captisol), cosolvent solubilization (i.e. propyl-
ene glycol) or micellar solubilization (i.e. Tween 80).
[0165] The sterile injectable preparation may also be a
sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic
parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a
solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles
and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer’s
solution, and isotonic sodium chloride solution, In addition,
sterile, ﬁxed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent
or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland ﬁxed oil
may be employed, including synthetic mono- or diglycer-
ides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the
preparation of injectables.

[0166] For pulmonary administration, the pharmaceutical
composition may be administered in the form of an aerosol
or with an inhaler including dry powder aerosol.

l -(1 H-imidazol-2-yl) -N,N-dimethylmethanamine

[0212] To a two-necked round-bottomed ﬂask equipped
with a reﬂux condenser and a pressure-equalizing addition
funnel, was added 2-imidazolecarboxaldehyde (6 g, 62.5
mmol) in MeOH (60 mL). To this suspension (ambient
temperature) was added a solution of dimethylamine (40%
aqueous, 60 mL) at a fast dropping rate (20 min). After the
addition was complete, solid sodium borohydride (7 g, 186.8
mmol,) was CAUTIOUSLY added portionwise over 45 min,
Foaming occurred aﬁer each portion, and the internal tem-
perature was allowed to maintain -50° C. without external
cooling. The reaction mixture was then heated to 65° C, for
3 h and allowed to cool to ambient temperature for over-
night. The reaction contents were concentrated in vacuo and
the resultant residue was taken up in EtOAc (2x30 mL)
washed with brine and with CHCl3 (4x100 mL). The EtOAc
extract was discarded. The CHCl3 extract was dried over
(NaSO4), ﬁltered, and concentrated in vacuo to give 3.7 g of
the desired product as a waxy solid.

has been related to several disorders, ranging from non-life
threatening diseases such as psoriasis to extremely serious
diseases such as cancers.

[0002] n view of the large number of protein kinases and
associatec diseases, there is an ever-existing need for new
inhibitors selective for various protein kinases which might
be useful in the treatment of related diseases

[0003] This invention concerns a new family of acetylenic
heteroary compounds and their use in treating cancers, bone
disorders, metabolic disorders, inﬂammatory disorders and
other diseases.

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION

et’s Disease, etc), inﬂammation (including rheumatoid
arthritis, among other inﬂammatory disorders) and cancer
(including solid tumors and leukemias, especially those
mediated 3y one or more kinases such as Src or kdr, or by
dysregulation of a kinase such as Ab] and mutant variants
thereof), including, among others, advanced cases and cases
which are resistant or refractory to one or more other
treatments.

[0301] Other cellular assays may be used which rely upon
a reporter gene to detect metabolically active cells. Non-
limiting examples of reporter gene expression systems
include green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP), and luciferase. As
an example of the use of GFP to screen for potential
antitumor drugs, Sanaman et al. (Chem Biol 62541-51;
incorporated herein by reference) used HeLa cells contain-
ing an inducible variant of GFP to detect compounds that
inhibited expression of the GFP, and thus inhibited cell
proliferation.

[0302] Compounds identiﬁed by such cellular assays as
having anti-cell proliferation activity are then tested for
anti-tumor activity in whole organisms. Preferably, the
organisms are mammalian Well-characterized mammalians
systems for studying cancer include rodents such as rats and
mice. Typically, a tumor of interest is transplanted into a
mouse having a reduced ability to mount an immune
response to the tumor to reduce the likelihood of rejection
Such mice include for example, nude mice (athymic) and
SCID (severe combined immunodeﬁciency) mice. Other
transgenic mice such as oncogene containing mice may be
used in the present assays (see for example US. Pat. No.
4,736,866 and US. Pat. No. 5,175,383). For a review and
discussion on the use of rodent models for antitumor drug
testing see Kerbel (Cancer Metastasis Rev. 17:301-304,
1998-99),

[0303] In general, the tumors of interest are implanted in
a test organism preferably subcutaneously. The organism
containing the tumor is treated with doses of candidate
anti-tumor compounds. The size of the tumor is periodically
measured to determine the etfects of the test compound on
the tumor. Some tumor types are implanted at sites other
than subcutaneous sites (eg, intraperitoneal sites) and sur-
vival is measured as the endpoint. Parameters to be assayed
with routine screening include different tumor models, vari-
ous tumor and drug routes, and dose amounts and schedule.
For a review of the use of mice in detecting antitumor
compounds see Corbett et al. (Invest New Drugs. 15:207-
218, 1997; incorporated herein by reference).

Kinase Inhibition

[0283] More speciﬁcally, the compounds described herein
are screened for kinase inhibition activity as follows.
Kinases suitable for use in the following protocol include,
but are not limited to: Abl, Lck, Lyn, Src, Fyn, Syk, Zap-70,
Itk, Tec, Btk, EGFR, ErbB2, Kdr, Fltl, Flt-3, Tek, c-Met,
InsR, and AKT.

[0284] Kinases are expressed as either kinase domains or
full length constructs fused to glutathione S-transferase
(GST) or polyHistidine tagged fusion proteins in either E.
coli or Baculovirus-High Five expression systems. They are
puriﬁed to near homogeneity by aﬂinity chromatography as
previously described (Lehr et al., 1996; Gish et al., 1995). In
some instances, kinases are co-expressed or mixed with
puriﬁed or partially puriﬁed regulatory polypeptides prior to
measurement of activity.

[0285] Kinase activity and inhibition can be measured by
established protocols (see e.g., Braunwalder et al., 1996). In
such cases, the transfer of 331’04 from ATP to the synthetic
substrates poly(Glu, Tyr) 4:1 or poly(Argr Ser) 3:1 attached
to the bioactive surface of microtiter plates is taken as a
measure of enzyme activity. After an incubation period, the

74

Jan. 3], 2019

amount of phosphate transferred is measured by ﬁrst wash-
ing the plate with 0.5% phosphoric acid, adding liquid
scintillant, and then counting in a liquid scintillation detec-
tor, The IC50 is determined by the concentration of com-
pound that causes a 50% reduction in the amount of 33])
Incorporated onto the substrate bound to the plate

[0286] In one method, the activated kinase is incubated
with a biotinylated substrate peptide (conmining tyr) with or
without the presence of a compound of the invention. After
the kinase assay incubation period, excess kinase inhibitor is
added to kill the kinase reaction along with Europium
-labeled anti-phosphotyrosine antibody (Eu-Ab) and A110-
phycocyanin-Streptavidin (SA-AFC). The biotinylated sub-
strate peptide (with or without phosphorylated Tyrosine) in
solution binds to the SA-APC via Biotin-Avidin binding.
The Eu-Ab binds only to substrate with phosphorylated
tryrosine. When the solution is excited at 615 um, there is an
energy transfer from the Europium to the APC when they are
in close proximity (ie attached to the same molecule of
biotinylated and phosphorylated substrate peptide). The
APC then ﬂuoresces at a wavelength of 665 nm. Excitation
and emission take place in a Wallac Victor2 V plate reader
where the plate is read ﬂuorometrically and absorbances at
615 and 665 nm are recorded, These data are then processed
by an Excel plate processor which calculates ICSOS of test
compounds by convening the ﬂuorescence into amounts of
phosphorylated substrate made and determining the concen-
tration of test compound that would be required to inhibit the
development of phosphorylated substrate by 50% (IC50).
[0287] Other methods relying upon the transfer of phos-
phate to peptide or polypeptide substrate containing tyro-
sine, serine, threonine or histidine, alone, in combination
with each other, or in combination with other amino acids,
in solution or immobilized (i.e., solid phase) are also useful.
[0288] For example, transfer of phosphate to a peptide or
polypeptide can also be detected using scintillation proxim-
ity, Fluorescence Polarization or homogeneous time-re-
solved ﬂuorescence. Alternatively, kinase activity can be
measured using antibody-based methods in which an anti-
body or polypeptide is used as a reagent to detect phospho-
rylated target polypeptide.

assay metiodologies, see e.g., Braunwalder et al., 1996,

Cell-Basec Assays

[0291] Certain compounds of this invention have also
been demonstrated cytotoxic or growth inhibitory effects on
tumor and other cancer cell lines and thus may be useful in
the treatment of cancer and other cell proliferative diseases.
Compounc s are assayed for anti-tumor activity using in vivo
and in Vitro assays which are well known to those skilled in
the art Generally, initial screens of compounds to identify
candidate anti-cancer drugs are performed in cellular assays.
Compounc s identiﬁed as having anti-proliferative activity in
such cell-based assays can then be subsequently assayed in
whole organisms for anti-tumor activity and toxicity. Gen-

erally speaking, cell-based screens can be performed more
rapidly and cost-effectively relative to assays that use whole
organisms For purposes of this invention, the terms “anti-
tumor” and “anti-cancer" activity are used interchangeably
[0292] Cell-based methods for measuring antiproliferative
activity are well known and can be used for comparative
characterization of compounds of this invention. In general,
cell proliferation and cell viability assays are designed to
provide a detectable signal when cells are metabolically
active. Compounds may be tested for antiproliferative activ-
ity by measuring any observed decrease in metabolic activ-
ity of the cells aﬁer exposure of the cells to compound.
Commonly used methods include, for example, measure-
ment of membrane integrity (as a measure of cell viability)
(eg, using trypan blue exclusion) or measurement of DNA
synthesis (eg. by measuring incorporation of BrdU or
3H-thymidine).

[0293] Some methods for assaying cell proliferation use a
reagent that is converted into a detectable compound during
cell proliferation. Particularly preferred compounds are tet-
razolium salts and include without limitation MTT (3-(4,
5-d.imethy1thiazol-2-y1)—2,5-dipheny1tetrazio1ium bromide;
Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Mo), MTS (3-(4,5-d.imethy1thi-
azol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfopheny1)-
2H-tetrazolium), XTT (2,3-bis(2-Methoxy-4-nitro-5-sulfo-
phenyl)-2H-tetrazolium-5-carboxanilide), INT, NET, and
NTV (Bemas et al. Biochim Biophys Acta 1451(1):73-81,
1999), Preferred assays utilizing tetrazolium salts detect cell
proliferation by detecting the product of the enzymatic
conversion of the tetrazolium salts into blue formazan
derivatives, which are readily detected by spectroscopic
methods (Mosman, J Immunol. Methods. 65 55-63, 1983),
[0294] Generally, preferred methods for assaying cell pro-
liferation involve incubating cells in a desired growth
medium with and Without the compounds to be tested,
Growth conditions for various prokaryotic and eukaryotic
cells are well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art
(Ausubel et a1, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology
Wiley and Sons 1999; Bonifacino et al, Current Protocols in
Cell Biology Wiley and Sons, 1999 both incorporated
herein by reference). To detect cell proliferation, the tetra-
zolium salts are added to the incubated cultured cells to
allow enzymatic conversion to the detectable product by
active cells. Cells are processed, and the optical density of
the cells is determined to measure the amount of formazan
derivatives. Furthermore, commercially available kits,
including reagents and protocols, are available for examples,
from Promega Corporation (Madison, Wis), Sigma-Aldrich
(St. Louis, MO), and Trevigen (Gaithersburg, Md.).
[0295] More specifically, the cell proliferation assay we
currently perform is using CellTiter 96 AQueous One Solu-
tion Cell Proliferation assay kit (Promaga, Cat#G3581). This
assay is a colorimetric method for determining the number
of alive cells in proliferation or cytotoxicity assays, The
assay utilizing terazolium salts detect cell proliferation by
detecting the product of the enzymatic conversion of the
tetrazolium salts into blue forrnazan derivatives, which can

be measured by the absorbance at 490 nm in a plate reader,
Wallac VictorJV (PerkinElmer).

[0296] An example of cell-based assay is shown as below,
The cell lines used in the assay are Ba/F3, a murine pro-B
cell line, which have been stably transfected with full-length
wild-type Bcr-Abl or Bcr-Abl with various kinase domain
point mutations (including T3511, Y253F, E255K, HS96P,

Jan. 31, 2019

M351T etc) constructs. Parental Ba/F3 cell line is used as
control. These cell lines were obtained from Brian J. Druker
(Howard Hughes Medical Institute, Oregon Health and
Science University, Portland, Oreg. USA), Ba/F3 cell
expressing Bcr—Abl or Bcr—Abl mutants were maintained in
PRMI 1640 growth medium with 200 pM L-glutamine, 10%
FCS, penicillin (200U/ml), and streptomycin (200 [Lg/ml).
Parental Ba/F3 cells were culture in the same medium
supplemented with 10 ng/ml IL-3.

[0297] Parental Ba/F3 cells (supplemented with IL-3) or
Ba/F3 cells expressing WT or mutant Bcr-Abl are plated in
duplicate at l><104 cells/well in 96-well plates with the
compounds in diﬂerent concentrations in the media. The
compounds are ﬁrst dissolved and diluted in DMSO by
preparation of 4-fold dilution; next equal volumes of com-
pounds with DMSO are transferred to medium and then
transferred to cell plates. The ﬁnal compound concentrations
start from 10 [,LM to 6 nM. DMSO at same percentage is used
as control. After compound was incubated with cells for 3
days, the numbers of active cells are measured using Cell-
Titer 96 AQueous One Solution Cell Proliferation assay kit
following the kit instruction. Basically, the tetrazolium salts
are added to the incubated cultured cells to allow enzymatic
conversion to the detectable product by active cells. Cells
are processed, and the optical density of the cells is deter-
mined to measure the amount of fonnazan derivatives
Mean+/—SD are generated from duplicated wells and
reported as the percentage absorbance of control. IC50s are
calculated in best-ﬁt curves using Microsoft Excel-ﬁt soft-
ware,

[0298] In addition, a wide variety of cell types may be
used to screen compounds for antiproliferative activity,
including the following cell lines, among others: COLO 205
(colon cancer), DLD-l (colon cancer), HCT—lS (colon can-
cer), HT29 (colon cancer), HEP G2 (Hepatoma), K-562
(Leukemia), A549 (Lung). NCI-H249 (Lung), MCF7 (Mam-
mary), MDA-MB-23l (Mammary), SAOS—2 (Osteosar-
coma), OVCAR-3 (Ovarian), PANC-l (Pancreas), DU-145
(Prostate), PC-3 (Prostate), ACHN (Renal), CAKI-l (Re-
nal), MG-63 (Sarcoma),

[0299] While the cell line is preferably mammalian, lower
order eukaryotic cells such as yeast may also be used to
screen compounds Preferred mammalian cell lines are
derived from humans, rats, mice, rabbits, monkeys, ham-
sters, and guinea pigs since cells lines from these organisms
are well-studied and characterized. However, others may be
used as well.

[0300] Suitable manunalian cell lines are often derived
from tumors. For example, the following tumor cell-types
may be sources of cells for culturing cells: melanoma,
myeloid leukemia, carcinomas of the lung, breast, ovaries,
colon, kidney, prostate, pancreas and testes), cardiomyo-
cy‘tes, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, lymphocytes (T-cell
and B cell), mast cells, eosinophils, vascular intimal celans,
hepatocytes, leukocytes including mononuclear leukocytes,
stem cells such as haemopoetic, neural, skin, lung, kidney,
liver and myocyte stem cells (for use in screening for
differentiation and de-differentiation factors), osteoclasts,
chondrocytes and other connective tissue cells, keratino-
cy‘tes, melanocytes, liver cells, kidney cells, and adipocytes.
Non-limiting examples of mammalian cells lines that have
been widely used by researchers include HeLa, NIH/3T3,
HT1080, CHO, COS-1, 293T, WI-38 and CVl/EBNA-1.

[0098] Also, one may chose reagents enriched for a
desired isotope, e,g. deuterium in place of hydrogen, to
create compounds of this invention containing such isotope
(5). Compounds containing deuterium in place of hydrogen
in one or more locations, or containing various isotopes of
C, N, P and O, are encompassed by this invention and may
be used, for instance, for studying metabolism and/or tissue
distribution of the compounds or to alter the rate or path of
metabolism or other aspects of biological functioning.

[0099] The compounds of the this invention can be syn-
thesized using the methods described below, together with
swithetic methods known in the art of synthetic organic
chemistry, or by a variation thereon as appreciated by those
skilled in the art, Preferred methods include, but are not
limited to those described below. The reactions are pre-
formed in a solvent appropriate to the reagents and materials
employed and suitable for the transformation being eﬁected.
It will be understood by those skilled in the art of organic
synthesis that the functionality present on the molecule
should be consistent the transformations proposed. This will
sometimes required some judgment to modify the order of
the synthetic steps or to select one particular process scheme
over another in order to obtain a desired compound of the
invention,

[0100] A compound of the present invention could be
prepared as outlined in Scheme I to Scheme XIX and via
standard methods known to those skilled in the art.

[0101] A palladium catalyzed Sonogashira coupling reac-
tion is used to link the ‘top’ Ring T to the ‘bottom’ [Ring
A]-[L1]-[Ring B] moiety as illustrated in Scheme I and II. In
Scheme I the Sonogashira coupling reaction is performed
with an acetylenic ‘top’ Ring T and a [Ring A]-[L1]-[Ring B]
moiety which has been activated by the presence of a
reactive group, W, which is an I, a Br or another reactive
group permitting the desired coupling reaction. The vari-
ables in the W—[Ring A]-[L1]-[Ring B] are as deﬁned pre-
viously, Rings A and B being substituted with permitted R“
and Rb groups, respectively.

[0089] This invention encompasses only those combina-
tions of substituents and variables that result in a stable or
chemically feasible compound. A stable compound or
chemically feasible compound is one that has stability
sufﬁcient to permit its preparation and detection. Preferred
compounds of this invention are suﬂiciently stable that they
are not substantially altered when kept at a temperature of
40° C. or less, in the absence of moisture or other chemically
reactive conditions, for at least a week.

[0090] Certain compounds of this invention may exist in
tautomeric forms, and this invention includes all such tau-
tomeric forms of those compounds unless otherwise speci-
ﬁed.

[0091] Unless otherwise stated, structures depicted herein
are also meant to include all stereochemical forms of the
structure; i.e., the R and S conﬁgurations for each asym-
metric center. Thus, single stereochemical Isomers as well as
enantiomeric and diastereomeric mixtures of the present
compounds are within the scope of the invention. Thus, this
invention encompasses each diastereomer or enantiomer
substantially free of other isomers (>90%, and preferably
>95%, free from other stereoisomers on a molar basis) as
well as a mixture of such isomers

[0092] Particular optical isomers can be obtained by reso-
lution of the racemic mixtures according to conventional
processes, e.g., by formation of diastereoisomeric salts. by
treatment with an optically active acid or base. Examples of
appropriate acids are tartaric, diacetyltartaric, dibenzoyltar-
taric, ditoluoyltartaric, and cam horsulfonic acid and then
separation of the mixture of diastereoisomers by crystalli-
zation followed by liberation o the optically active bases
from these salts. A different process for separation of optical
isomers involves the use of a chiral chromatography column
optimally chosen to maximize the separation of the
enantiomers. Still another metiod involves synthesis of
covalent diastereoisomeric mo ecules by reacting com-
pounds of the invention with an optically pure acid in an
activated form or an optically pure isocyanate. The synthe-
sized diastereoisomers can be separated by conventional
means such as chromatography, distillation, crystallization
or sublimation, and then hydrolyzed to deliver the
enantiomerically pure compoun .
[0093] Optically active compounds of the invention can be
obtained by using active starting materials. These isomers
may be in the form of a free acic, a free base, an ester or a
salt.
[0094] The compounds of this invention can exist in
radiolabelled form, i.e., said com ounds may contain one or
more atoms containing an atomic mass or mass number
different from the atomic mass or mass number: ordinarily
found in nature. Radioisotopes of hydrogen, carbon, phos-
phorous, ﬂuorine and chlorine include 3H, 14C, 32P, 35S, 43F
and 36Cl, respectively. Compounds of this invention which
contain those radioisotopes and/or other radioisotopes of
other atoms are within the scope of this invention. Tritiated,

 

Jan. 31, 2019

i.e., 3H, and carbon-l4, i.e., MC, radioisotopes are particu-
larly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability.
[0095] Radiolabelled compounds of this invention can
generally be prepared by methods well known to those
skilled in the art. Conveniently, such radiolabelled com-
pounds can be prepared by carrying out the procedures
disclosed herein except substituting a readily available
radiolabelled reagent for a non-radiolabelled reagent.

4. Synthetic Overview

[0096] The practitioner has a well-established literature of
heterocyclic and other relevant chemical transformations,
recovery and puriﬁcation technologies to draw upon, in
combination with the information contained in the examples
which follow, for guidance on swithetic strategies, protect-
ing groups, and other materials and methods useful for the

[0097] Various synthetic approaches may be used to pro-
duce the compounds described herein, including those
approaches depicted schematically below. The practitioner
will appreciate that protecting groups may be used in these
approaches. “Protecting groups", are moieties that are used
to temporarily block chemical reaction at a potentially
reactive site (e.g., an amine, hydroxy, thiol, aldehyde, etc.)
so that a reaction can be carried out selectively at another
site in a multifunctional compound. In preferred embodi-
ments, a protecting group reacts selectively in good yield to
give a protected substrate that is suitable for the planned
reactions; the protecting group should be selectively remov-
able in good yield by readily available, preferably nontoxic
reagents that do not unduly attack the other functional
groups present; the protecting group preferably forms an
readily separable derivative (more preferably without the
generation of new stereogenic centers); and the protecting
group preferably has a minimum of additional functionality
to avoid the complication of further sites of reaction. Awide
variety of protecting groups and strategies, reagents and
conditions for deploying and removing them are known in
the art. See, e.g., “Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis”
Third Ed. Greene. T. W. and Wuts, P. G., Eds., John Wiley
& Sons, New York: 1999. For additional background infor-
mation on protecting group methodologies (materials, meth-
ods and strategies for protection and deprotection) and other

compounds described herein, see in R. Larock. Comprehen-

especially but not limited to kdr and Src family kinases, as
well as for studying the role of such kinases in biological and
pathological phenomena; for studying intracellular signal
transduction pathways mediated by such kinases, for the

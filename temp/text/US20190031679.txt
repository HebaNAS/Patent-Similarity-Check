an osmotic gradient generated by inappropriate salt absorp-
tion, dehydrating airway mucous secretions and reducing the
volume of liquid in the PCL. In COPD, cigarette smoke
impairs CFTR function, thus creating an acquired phenotype
similar to CF.

[0243] PZY2 Receptor Agonists:

[0244] Agents that that may be administered in combina-
tion with the methods and molecules described in the present
invention include a group of PZY2 agonists. Purinergic
(P2Y2) receptors are abundant on luminal surface of human
bronchial epithelium (HBE) and are known to stimulate Cl“
secretion and inhibit Na‘ absorption (Goralski et all, Curr
Opin Pharmacoli 2010 June; 10(3):294-9). UTP is an
example of an endogenous PZY2 receptor agonist that pro-
vides a robust stimulation of chloride secretion, inhibition of
sodium absorption and increase in airway surface liquid
layer in airway epithelium, thus increasing the mucus clear-
ance which is the primary defense mechanism of the lung
Early studies using uridine—5-triphosphate (UT P) delivered
via aerosol to airway surfaces of CF and primary cilia
dyskinesia (PCD) patients suggested the usefulness of UT?
in enhancing MC and improving mean cough clearance
rates.

[0246] Activators of Alternative Chloride Channels Such
as CaCCs and ClC-2 Class Channels:

[0247] CaCCs are broadly expressed in mammalian cells
where they are involved in a wide range of physiological
functions, including transepithelial ﬂuid secretion, oocyte
fertilization, olfactory and sensory signal transduction,
smooth muscle contraction, and neuronal and cardiac exci-
tation. Whole cell current analysis indicates several common
features between CaCC subfamilies, including slow activa-
tion following membrane depolarization, outwardly rectify-
ing steady state currents and greater iodide than chloride
permeability. Single channel analysis has suggested four or
more distinct CaCC subclasses, with a wide range of
reported single channel conductances from less than 2 p8 in
cardiac myocytes to 50 pS in airway epithelial cells.
[0248] The consequences of CaCC activation are cell type
speciﬁc, for example, chloride secretion in epithelial cells,
action potential generation in olfactory receptor neurons,
smooth muscle contraction, and prevention of polyspermia
in oocytes. In some cell types, such as smooth muscle cells,
membrane depolarization activates voltagegated calcium
channels, increasing intracellular calcium concentration.
Although CaCCs were functionally characterized nearly
three decades ago, their molecular identity has remained
unclear until recently, with potential candidates including
bestrophins (BESTl-BEST4) (Sun et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci
US A 99, 4008-4013 (2002) and Tsunenari et al., J Biol
Chem 278, 41114-41125 (2003)), the calcium activated
chloride channel ClCA family proteins (Gruber et al.,
Genomics 1998; 542200-214) and ClC3 (Huang P et al.
(2001) Regulation of human CLC-3 channels by multifunc-
tional Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. JBC 276:
20093-100). Three independent laboratories have identiﬁed
TMEM16A, also called anoctaminl, as a strong candidate

for a CaCC (Yang Y D et al. (2008) TMEM16A confers
receptor-activated calcium-dependent chloride conductance.
Nature, 455: 1210-15; Caputo A et al. (2008) TMEM16A, a
membrane protein associated with calcium-dependent chlo-
ride channel activity. Science, 322: 590-4; Schroeder B C et
al. (2008) Expression cloning of TMEM16A as a calcium-
activated chloride channel subunit Cell. 134: 1019-29).
Three diﬁerent strategies were used: database searching for
membrane proteins with multiple transmembrane segments
and unknown function (Yang Y D et al. (2008) TMEM16A
confers receptor-activated calcium-dependent chloride con-
ductance. Nature, 455: 1210-15), functional genomics fol-
lowing the observation that interleukin 4 (114) treated
bronchial epithelial cells show increased CaCC activity
(Caputo A et all (2008) TMEM16A, a membrane protein
associated with calcium-dependent chloride channel activ-
ity. Science, 322: 590-4), and expression cloning using
axolotl oocytes that do not have endogenous CaCC activity
(Schroeder B C et all (2008) Expression cloning of
TMEM16A as a calcium-activated chloride channel subunit.
Cell, 134: 1019-29). There is strong evidence to suggest
TMEMlGA is a key component of CaCC, including simi-
larity to native CaCCs in its electrophysiological properties,
appearance of CaCC currents in various transfected cell
systems, reduction in CaCC currents following RNAi
knockdown, and its tissue distribution. TMEMl 6A has eight
putative transmembrane segments without domains evi-
dently involved in calcium regulation.

[0249] ClC2 is a ubiquitously expressed, inwardly recti-
fying chloride channel that is activated by cell swelling,
ClC2 was thought to be involved in cell volume regulation,
but it has different biophysical characteristics from the
volume sensitive chloride channels that have been charac-
terized in many tissuesi Suitable alternative chloride channel
activators are described in US. Pat. Nos. 6,015,828, 6,159,
969 and 7,253,295. The therapeutic efﬁcacy of activators of
Alternative Chloride Channels such as CaCCs and ClC-2
Class Channels can be enhanced by the administration of
compounds and methods of this invention.

[0250] Modulators of CFTR Activity

[0251] The hereditary lethal disease cystic ﬁbrosis is
caused mutations in the gene encoding CFTR protein, a
cAMP activated chloride channel expressed in the airway
epithelia, Various mutations in CFTR cause ion transport
dysfunction by limiting the chloride ion secretion to the
surface of the airway epithelium via CFTR and by dys-
regulation of sodium ion absorption, leading to excessive
absorption of sodium cations. These defects in ion transport
result in impaired hydration of airway surface liquid layer,
decrease in mucus clearance and lead to progressive loss of
lung function. Recently, it has been shown that CFTR
functional defects are present in cigarette smoke exposed
tissue, thus implying the role of CFTR dysfunction in
COPD.

[0252] Over 1500 putative mutations have been described

in CFTR which can be divided into classes according to the
molecular mechanism of the genetic defect (Rowe et al.,
Pulm Pharmacol Ther,, 23(4):268-78 (2010)). An under-
standing of the biology of each of these mutations has led to
therapeutic strategies based on the particular mutation type.
Class 1 mutations include premature termination codons
(PTCs, eig. nonsense mutations) within the coding region of
CFTR, which cause premature truncation of normal protein
translation. These mutations are found in 10% of CF

[0180] The compounds described herein may be prepared
and used as the free base Alternatively, the compounds may
be prepared and used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts that retain or
enhance the desired biological activity of the parent com-

pound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects,
Examples of such salts are (a) acid addition salts formed
with inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid, hyd-
robromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid and
the like; (b) salts formed with organic acids such as, for
example, acetic acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, succinic acid,
maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, citric acid, malic
acid, ascorbic acid, benzoic acid, tannic acid, palmitic acid,
alginic acid, polyglutamic acid, naphthalenesulfonic acid,
methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalene-
disulfonic acid, polygalacturonic acid, malonic acid, sulfos-
alicylic acid, glycolic acid, 2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate, pamo-
ate, salicylic acid, stearic acid, phthalic acid, mandelic acid,
lactic acid and the like; and (c) salts formed from elemental
anions for example, chlorine, bromine, and iodine,

[0181] It is to be noted that all enantiomers, diastereomers,
and racemic mixtures, tautomers, polymorphs, pseudopoly-
morphs and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds
within the scope of formulae I (Ia-Id) are embraced by the
present invention. All mixtures of such enantiomers and
diastereomers are within the scope of the present invention,
[0182] A compound of formu a I and its pharmaceutically
acceptable salts may exist as different polymorphs or pseu-
dopolymorphs, As used herein, crystalline polymorphism
means the ability of a crysta line compound to exist in
different crystal structures. The crystalline polymorphism
may result from differences in crystal packing (packing
polymorphism) or differences in packing between different
conformers of the same molecu e (conformational polymor-
phism). As used herein, crystalline pseudopolymorphism
means the ability of a hydrate or solvate of a compound to
exist in different crystal structures. The pseudopolymorphs
of the instant invention may exist due to ditferences in
crystal packing (packing pseu opolymorphism) or due to
differences in packing between different conformers of the
same molecule (conformational pseudopolymorphism). The
instant invention comprises all polymorphs and pseudopo-
lymorphs of the compounds of formula I-III and their
pharmaceutically acceptable sa ts.
[0183] A compound of formu a I and its pharmaceutically
acceptable salts may also exist as an amorphous solid, As
used herein, an amorphous solid is a solid in which there is
no long-range order of the positions of the atoms in the solid,
This deﬁnition applies as well when the crystal size is two
nanometers or less, Additives, including solvents, may be
used to create the amorphous forms of the instant invention,
The instant invention comprises all amorphous forms of the
compounds of formula 1-111 and their pharmaceutically
acceptable salts.

[0184] The compounds of formula I may exist in different
tautomeric forms One skilled in the art will recognize that
amidines, amides, guanidines, ureas, thioureas, heterocycles
and the like can exist in tautomeric forms. All possible
tautomeric forms of the amidines, amides, guanidines, ureas,
thioureas, heterocycles and the like of all of the embodi-
ments of formula I are within the scope of the instant
invention.

[0185] “Enantiomers” refer to two stereoisomers of a
compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of
one another.

[0186] Stereochemical deﬁnitions and conventions used
herein generally follow S, P. Parker, Edi, McGraw-Hill

Company, New York; and Eliel, E. and Wilen, 3., Stereo-

chemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) John Wiley &
Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in
optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the
plane of plane-polarized light, In describing an optically
active compound, the preﬁxes D and L or R and S are used
to denote the absolute conﬁguration of the molecule about
its chiral center(s), The preﬁxes d and l, D and L, or (+) and
(—) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-
polarized light by the compound, with S, (—), or 1 meaning
that the compound is levorotatory while a compound pre-
ﬁxed with R, (+), or d is dextrorotatory, For a given chemical
structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they
are mirror images of one another. A speciﬁc stereoisomer
may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of
such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture, A
50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic
mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has
been no stereoselection or stereospeciﬁcity in a chemical
reaction or process. The terms “racemic mixture” and “race-
mate” refer to an equimolar mixture of two enantiomeric
species, devoid of optical activity.

[0187] A single stereoisomer, eg. an enantiomer, substan-
tially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution
of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of
diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (“Ste-
reochemistry of Carbon Compounds,” (1962) by E, L, Eliel,
McGraw Hill; Lochrnuller, C. H, (1975) J. Chromatogrt,
113:(3) 283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of
the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable
method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric
salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional
crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereo-
meric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separa-
tion of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure ste-
reoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or
enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions.

[0188] “Diastereomer” refers to a stereoisomer with two
or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not
mirror images of one another Diastereomers have different
physical properties, erg. melting points, boiling points, spec-
tral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers
may separate under high resolution analytical procedures
such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

Without being limited to any particular theory, it is believed
that the compounds of formula (I), formula II, or formula III
function in vivo as biological reducing, By blocking epithe-
lial sodium channels present in mucosal surfaces the com-
pounds of formula (I), formula II, or formula III reduce the
absorption of water by the mucosal surfaces. This effect
increases the volume of protective liquids on mucosal sur-
faces, rebalances the system, and thus treats disease.

[0189] The compounds described herein may be prepared
and used as the free base, Alternatively, the compounds may
be prepared and used as a pharmaceutically acceptable salt.
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts that retain or
enhance the desired biological activity of the parent com-
pound and do not impart undesired toxicological effects.
Examples of such salts are (a) acid addition salts formed
with inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid, hyd-

patients, but are particularly common in Ashkenazi Jews
(75% of mutant CFTR alleles). Class II CFTR mutations
include F508del CFTR, the most common mutation in
humans (accounting for 75% of alleles and found in approxi-
mately 90% of CF patients). The deletion of phenylalanine
at the 508 position causes CFTR to exhibit abnormal folding
characterized by deﬁcient stabilization by domain-domain
interactions between the nucleotide binding domain 1
(NBDl) and the transmembrane domains. The misfolded
protein is recognized by cellular chaperones within the
endoplasmic reticulum (ER), directed to the proteasome, and
rapidly degraded prior to reaching its active site at the cell
surface, Because the cellular machinery responsible for the
recognition and degradation of the misfolded protein is not
100% efficient, particular individuals exhibit low levels of
surface expression of F508del CFTR, which may account
for partial CFTR activity (and a more mild CF phenotype)
observed in individuals homozygous for F508del CFTR, and
could represent a population more amenable to protein
repair. Even when at the cell surface, F508del CFTR exhib-
its reduced gating. suggesting that misfolded CFTR also
exhibits reduced CFTR ion channel activity. Class III and IV
CFTR mutations are characterized by full-length CFTR that
reaches the cell surface but exhibit reduced ion transport
activity owing to abnormal channel gating (Class III, e.g.
G551D) or reduced conductivity of the ion channel pore
(Class IV, e.g, R117H), Similarly, splicing mutants (Class V)
and mutations within the C-terrninus (Class VI) are also full
length, but exhibit reduced activity owing to reduced num-
bers of active channels within the plasma membrane,
Although the molecular basis of CFTR mutants is complex
and as yet incomplete, the classiﬁcation of CFT R mutants
can be simpliﬁed into the therapeutically relevant groups
based on the activity of agents in development, Both tradi-
tional and high-throughput drug discovery programs have
resulted in discovery of novel compounds that address
speciﬁc mutant CFTR alleles. These ‘CFTR modulators’ are
pharmacological agents intended to repair the CFTR protein
and are described in each section that follows.

[0253] Potentiators of cell-surface cystic ﬁbrosis trans-
membrane conductance regulator CFTR mutation classes
that result in dysfunctional CFTR that resides at the plasma
membrane include Class III, IV, V, and VI mutations and
represent potential targets for CFTR activators, G551D
CFTR represents an archetype CFTR allele for this category
of agents, as it exhibits normal surface expression and
half-life, but confers a severe defect in channel gating owing
to an amino acid substitution in the adenosine triphosphate
(ATP) binding pocket within the nucleotide binding domains
(Gregory, R. J, et al. (1991) Maturation and function of
cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance regulator vari-
ants bearing mutations in putative nucleotide-binding
domains 1 and 2, MCB 11: 3886-93; Bompadre, S. G, et al,
(2007) G551D and G1349D, two CF-associated mutations
in the signature sequences of CFTR, exhibit distinct gating
defects. Gen Physiol, 129: 285-298). Flavonoids are well
known activators of mutant CFTR and were among the ﬁrst
to be studied for beneﬁcial effects in human individuals
(including topical administration), Although agents such as
genistein were affected by lack of efﬁcacy in the nasal
airway, more recent efforts have demonstrated activity of the
ﬂavonoid quercetin in the nose. However, ﬁavonoid agents
are challenged by poor solubility and systemic absorption,
and are poor development candidates for inhaled therapeu-

tics, More recent discovery strategies have focused on
identiﬁcation of compounds that ‘potentiate’ CFTR activity,
restoring endogenous regulation (e.g. cyclic adenosine
monosphosphate (cAMP)-dependent regulation) and ion
transport without excessive, constitutive activation that may
potentially be detrimental (such as excessive CFTR activa-
tion seen with certain diarrhea] illnesses), Identiﬁcation of
agents of this type is amenable to high-throughput screen-
ing-based strategies to discover agents that activate mutant
CFTR by measuring the eifects on anion conductance in
cell-based screening assays, Anumber of speciﬁc strategies
have been used for screens of this sort, including chloride
sensitive dyes, ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer-based
analysis of membrane potential, and cell conductance of
airway monolayers. Identiﬁcation and characterization of
small molecule potentiators of mutant CFTR have led to the
development of agents with pronounced activity in vitro and
in the clinic.

[0254] Signiﬁcant eﬁort has been directed toward the goal
of correcting the folding of F508del CFTR, thus restoring
ion channel activity to the misfolded protein, A diverse array
of cellular targets have been explored, conunensurate with
the large number of proteins now known to interact with
CFTR biogenesis. Agents such as 4-phenyl butyrate down-
regulate Hsc70 (or other cell chaperones) central to the
folding process, and represent an early example of com-
pounds tested in the clinic. Other more recent efforts have
resulted from high-throughput library screens for chloride
channel function following incubation of test compounds
with F508del expressing cells. A number of these strategies
have identiﬁed F508del correctors that may address cell
biogenesis through chaperone pathways, Pharmacologic
activity of such agents has also been reported to augment
F508del CFTR half-life in the plasma membrane through
altered surface recycling attributed to features of the cellular
processing machinery or reduced endocytic traﬁicking. This
class of agents may be potential drug development candi-
dates if their safety in vivo is conﬁrmed. Other compounds
have been shown to directly interact with CFTR and may
offer greater speciﬁcity than agents that alter general aspects
of cell folding or cellular quality control, The global cellular
response to misfolded protein may also represent a target.
Histone deacetylases (HDAC) have far-ranging effects on
gene expression, and speciﬁc members of the HDAC family
are involved in the ER associated degradation pathway
promoting degradation of F508del CFTR, Treatment of CF
cells with HDAC inhibitors can modulate ER stress, and
HDACs such as suberoylanilidehydroxamic acid, as well as
siRNA-silencing of HDACs, increase levels of F508del
CFTR in the cell membrane. The combination of approaches
such as these reveal a number of potential pharmacologic
agents for F508del correction. Additive or synergistic rescue
of F508del CFTR using more than one such strategy may
offer hope of achieving ion transport activity sufﬁcient to
confer a normal phenotype in CF respiratory epithelia,

[0255] Read-through of premature termination codons
(PTCs) represents another exciting approach to address the
underlying cause of CF, and many other genetic diseases
caused by PTCs. Certain aminoglycosides and other agents
have the capacity to interact with the eukaryotic rRNA
within the ribosomal subunits. Although this interaction is
much weaker than that seen in prokaryotes and is distinct
from the primary cause of aminoglycoside toxicity in human
individuals, it can modestly reduce the ﬁdelity of eukaryotic

Mucoly‘tic Combinations with Exemplary Anti-Inﬂamma-
tory Agents:

[0263] Inhaled corticosteroids are the standard of chronic
care for asthma, COPD and other respiratory diseases char-
acterized by acute and chronic inﬂammation leading to
airﬂow limitation Examples of anti-inﬂammatory agents
suitable for administration in combination with the methods
and molecules described in the present invention include
beclomethasone, budesonide, and ﬂuticasone and a group of
anti-inﬂammatory medications that do not contain steroids
known as non-steroiodal anti-inﬂammatory drugs
(NSAIDs).

[0264] Products of arachidonic acid metabolism, speciﬁ-
cally the lcukotrienes (LTs), contribute to pulmonary inﬂam-
mation. Cysteinylleukotrienes (LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4) are
produced predominantly by eosinophils, mast cells, and
macrophages Examples of leukotriene modiﬁers suitable
for administration by the method of this invention include
monteleukast, zileuton and zaﬁrlukasti

[0265] Mast cell stabilizers are cromone medications such
as cromolyn (sodium cromoglycate) used to prevent or
control certain allergic disorders. They block a calcium
channel essential for mast cell degranulation, stabilizing the
cell and thereby preventing the release of histamine and
related mediators. As inhalers they are used to treat asthma,
as nasal sprays to treat hay fever (allergic rhinitis) and as eye
drops for allergic conjunctivitis. Finally, in oral form they
are used to treat the rare condition of mastocytosis.

[0266] PDE4 inhibitors have been shown to modulate
pulmonary inﬂammation and used for treatment of chronic
obstnictive pulmonary diseases. Examples of PDE4 inhibi-

Mucolytic Combinations with Exemplary Bronchodilators:
[0267] Nitric Oxide (NO) Donors: NO, NO Donors, NO
and Peroxynitrite Scavengers and Inducible NO Synthase
Activity Modulatorsi Nitric oxide is a potent endogenous
vasodilator and bronchodilator that can be exogenously
administered via inhalation, It is synthesized by the conver-
sion of the terminal guanidine nitrogen atom of L—arginine
via endothelial cell calcium dependent enzyme nitric oxide
synthetase and then diffuses across the cell membrane to
activate the enzyme guanylatecyclasei This enzyme
enhances the synthesis of cyclic guanosine monophosphate
(cGMP), causing relaxation of vascular and bronchial

[0268] Nitric oxide synthesised in endothelial cells that
line blood vessels has a wide range of functions that are vital
for maintaining a healthy respiratory and cardiovascular
systems (Megsonl L et a1 Expert Opin Investig Drugs. 2002
May; ll(5):587-601i). Reduced nitric oxide availability is
implicated in the initiation and progression of many diseases
and delivery of supplementary nitric oxide to help prevent
disease progression is an attractive therapeutic option. Nitric
oxide donor drugs represent a useful means of systemic

nitric oxide delivery and organic nitrates have been used for
many years as eﬁective therapies for symptomatic relief
from angina. However, nitrates have limitations and a num-
ber of alternative nitric oxide donor classes have emerged
since the discovery that nitric oxide is a crucial biological

[0269] In the respiratory tract, NO is produced by resi-
dential and inﬂammatory cells (Ricciardolo F L et a1. Curr
Drug Targets 2006 June; 7(6):721-35). NO is generated via
oxidation of L-arginine that is catalysed by the enzyme NO
synthase (NOS). NOS exists in three distinct isoforms:
neuronal NOS (nNOS), inducible NOS (iNOS), and
endothelial NOS (eNOS). NO derived from the constitutive
isoforms of NOS (nNOS and eNOS) and other NO—adduct
molecules (nitrosothiols) are able to modulate bronchomotor
tone. NO derived from the inducible isoform of NO syn-
thase, up—regulated by different cytokines via NF-kappaB-
dependent pathway, seems to be a pro-inﬂammatory media-
tor with immunomodulatory eﬂects. In aging CF patients,
expression of iNOS is signiﬁcantly reduced (Yoon et al., J
Clin Invest. 2006 February; 116(2):436-46)i This reduced
expression of iNOS in chronic CF is associated with emer-
gence of mucoid muc mutant subpopulation of P. aerugi-
now. It has been suggested that 15 mM NOZ-kills mucA P
Aeruginosa in CF airways at pH 6.5. NO itself or as a
precursor to iron-nitrosyl species has been implicated in this
antimicrobial effect. Therefore inhaled N027, including but
not limited inhaled NaNOz, has an appeal as a CF therapy.
The production of NO under oxidative stress conditions
secondarily generates strong oxidizing agents (reactive
nitrogen species) that may amplify the inﬂammatory
response in asthma and COPD. Moreover, NO can be
exhaled and levels are abnormal in stable atopic asthma and
during exacerbations in both asthma and COPD. Exhaled
NO might therefore be a non-invasive tool to monitor the
underlying inﬂammatory process. It is suggested that NOS
regulation provides a novel target in the prevention and
treatment of chronic inﬂammatory diseases of the airways
such as asthma and COPD.

translation by interrupting the normal proofreading function
of the ribosome, Insertion of a near cognate amino acid at a
premature stop codon allows protein translation to continue
until one of several stop codons normally present at the end
of the mRNA transcript is reached and properly utilized, The
speciﬁcity of the strategy has been attributed to greater stop
codon ﬁdelity at the authentic end of mRNA and has been
established in vitro by demonstrating no detectable elonga-

Mucolytic Combinations with Anti-Infective Agents:

[0257] Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases are
accompanied by both acute and chronic bacterial infections,
Both acute and chronic infections lead to chronic inﬂam-
mation that has acute ﬂare-ups in the form of pulmonary
exacerbations, The underlying inﬂammation is treated with
variety of inhaled anti-inﬂammatory agents, For example, in
cystic ﬁbrosis the most common bacteria causing chronic
infection is Pseudomorm: aeruginom (P aeruginosa) and
antibiotics that are effective against this bacteria are a major
component of treatment (Flume, Am J Respir Crit Care Med,
l76(lO):957-69 (2007)). Also bacteria such as Staphylocoo
cu: aureus (S aureus), Burkholderia cepacia (B, cepacia)
and other gram negative organisms as well as anaerobes are
isolated from respiratory secretions and people with CF may
beneﬁt from treatment of these pathogens to maintain their
lung health. Anaerobic bacteria are also recognized as a
feature of CF airways, sinuses in subjects with chronic
sinusitis, and likely airways of subjects with COPD, Simi-
larly, aspirations or microaspirations. especially in elderly
population and during sleep, are associated with a chemical
pneumonitis, anaerobic infections and subsequent bron-
chiectasis. An ideal treatment of aspiration-related pneumo-
nitis and anaerobic infection would be an immediate treat-
ment, As such, antibiotics are used to eradicate early
infections, during pulmonary exacerbations and as chronic
suppressive therapy,

[0258] The primary measure of antibiotic activity is the
minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), The MIC is the
lowest concentration of an antibiotic that completely inhibits
the growth of a microorganism in vitro. While the MIC is a
good indicator of the potency of an antibiotic, it indicates
nothing about the time course of antimicrobial activity, PK
parameters quantify the lung tissue level time course of an
antibiotic, The three pharmacokinetic parameters that are
most important for evaluating antibiotic efﬁcacy are the peak
tissue level (Cmax), the trough level (Cmin), and the Area
Under the tissue concentration time Curve (AUC). While
these parameters quantify the tissue level time course, they
do not describe the killing activity of an antibiotic, Integrat-
ing the PK parameters with the MIC gives us three PK/PD
parameters which quantify the activity of an antibiotic: the
Peak/MIC ratio, the T>MIC, and the 24 h-AUC/MIC ratio,
The Peak/MIC ratio is simply the Cpmax divided by the
MIC. The T>MIC (time above MIC) is the percentage of a

Jan. 3], 2019

dosage interval in which the serum level exceeds the MIC.
The 24 h-AUC/MIC ratio is determined by dividing the
24-hour-AUC by the MIC. The three phannacodynamic
properties of antibiotics that best describe killing activity are
time-dependence, concentration-dependence, and persistent
elfects, The rate of killing is determined by either the length
of time necessary to kill (time-dependent), or the eﬁect of
increasing concentrations (concentration-dependent) Per-
sistent eifects include the Post-Antibiotic Eﬁect (PAE). PAE
is the persistent suppression of bacterial growth following
antibiotic exposure,

Using these parameters, antibiotics can be divided into 3
categories:

[0259] For Type I antibiotics (AG’s, ﬂuoroquinolones,
daptomycin and the ketolides), the ideal dosing regimen
would maximize concentration, because the higher the con-
centration, the more extensive and the faster is the degree of
killing Therefore, the 24 h-AUC/MIC ratio, and the Peak]
MIC ratio are important predictors of antibiotic eﬂicacy. For
aminoglycosides, it is best to have a Peak/MIC ratio of at
least 8-10 to prevent resistance. For ﬂuoroquinolonesvs
gram negative bacteria, the optimal 24 h-AUC/MIC ratio is
approximately 125, Versus gram positives, 40 appears to be
optimal. However, the ideal 24 h-AUC/MIC ratio for FQ’s
varies widely in the literature,

[0260] Type II antibiotics (beta-lactams, clindamycin,
erythromcyin, carbapenems and linezolid) demonstrate the
complete opposite properties, The ideal dosing regimen for
these antibiotics maximizes the duration of exposure. The
T>MIC is the parameter that best correlates with efﬁcacy.
For beta-lactams and erythromycin, maximum killing is
seen when the time above MIC is at least 70% of the dosing
interval.

[0261] Type III antibiotics (vancomycin, tetracyclines,
azithromycin, and the dalfopristin—quinupristin combina-
tion) have mixed properties, they have time-dependent kill-
ing and moderate persistent eﬁects, The ideal dosing regi-
men for these antibiotics maximizes the amount of drug
received, Therefore, the 24 h—AUC/MIC ratio is the param-
eter that correlates with eﬂicacy, For vancomycin, a 24
h-AUC/MIC ratio of at least 125 is necessary,

[0262] Patients including, but not limited to, CF, COPD,
non—CF bronchiectasis, aspiration pneumonia, asthma and
VAP patients suffering from respiratory infection caused by
bacteria susceptible to meropenem may beneﬁt from such
treatment. Examples of carbapenam antibiotics are: imipe-

methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, naphthalene-

alicylic acid, glycolic acid, 2-hydroxy-3-naphthoate, pamo-
ate, salicylic acid, stearic acid, phthalic acid, mandelic acid,
lactic acid and the like; and (c) salts formed from elemental
anions for example, chlorine, bromine, and iodine.

[0190] It is to be noted that all enantiomers, diastereomers,
and racemic mixtures, tautomers, polymorphs, pseudopoly-
morphs and pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds
within the scope of formulae (X are embraced by the present
invention. All mixtures of such enantiomers and diastereom-
ers are within the scope of the present invention.

[0191] A compound of formu a I and its pharrnaceutically
acceptable salts may exist as dilferent polymorphs or pseu-
dopolymorphs. As used herein, crystalline polymorphism
means the ability of a crysta line compound to exist in
different crystal structures. The crystalline polymorphism
may result from differences in crystal packing (packing
polymorphism) or differences in packing between different
conformers of the same molecu e (conformational polymor-
phism). As used herein, crystalline pseudopolymorphism
means the ability of a hydrate or solvate of a compound to
exist in dilferent crystal structures. The pseudopolymorphs
of the instant invention may exist due to dilferences in
crystal packing (packing pseucopolymorphism) or due to
differences in packing between different conformers of tie
same molecule (conformational pseudopolymorphism). Tie
instant invention comprises all polymorphs and pseudopo-
lymorphs of the compounds of formula 1-111 and their
pharmaceutically acceptable sa ts.
[0192] A compound of formu a I and its pharmaceutica ly
acceptable salts may also exist as an amorphous solid. As
used herein, an amorphous solid is a solid in which there is
no long-range order of the positions of the atoms in the solid.
This deﬁnition applies as well when the crystal size is two
nanometers or less. Additives, including solvents, may 3e
used to create the amorphous forms of the instant invention.
The instant invention comprises all amorphous forms of tie
compounds of formula I and their phannaceutically accept-
able salts.
[0193] The compounds of formula I may exist in different
tautomeric forms. One skilled in the art will recognize that
amidines, amides, guanidines, ureas, thioureas, heterocyc es
and the like can exist in tautomeric forms. All possible
tautomeric forms of the amidines, amides, guanidines, ureas,
thioureas, heterocycles and the like of all of the embodi-
ments of formula I-IV are within the scope of the instant
invention.

[0194] “Enantiomers” refer to two stereoisomers of a

compound which are non-superimposable mirror images of
one another.

[0195] Stereochemical deﬁnitions and conventions used
herein generally follow S. P. Parker, Edi, McGraw-Hill
Dictionary of Chemical Terms (1984) McGraw-Hill Book
Company, New York; and Eliel. E. and Wilen, 8., Stereo-
chemistry of Organic Compounds (1994) John Wiley &
Sons, Inc., New York. Many organic compounds exist in
optically active forms, i.e., they have the ability to rotate the
plane of plane-polarized light. In describing an optically

 

 

Jan. 31, 2019

active compound, the preﬁxes D and L or R and S are used
to denote the absolute conﬁguration of the molecule about
its chiral center(s). The preﬁxes d and 1, D and L, or (+) and
(—) are employed to designate the sign of rotation of plane-
polarized light by the compound, with S, (—), or 1 meaning
that the compound is levorotatory while a compound pre-
ﬁxed with R, (+), or d is dextrorotatory. For a given chemical
structure, these stereoisomers are identical except that they
are mirror images of one another. A speciﬁc stereoisomer
may also be referred to as an enantiomer, and a mixture of
such isomers is often called an enantiomeric mixture. A
50:50 mixture of enantiomers is referred to as a racemic
mixture or a racemate, which may occur where there has
been no stereoselection or stereospeciﬁcity in a chemical
reaction or process. The terms “racemic mixture” and “race-
mate” refer to an equirnolar mixture of two enantiomeric
species, devoid of optical activity.

[0196] A single stereoisomer. eg. an enantiomer, substan-
tially free of its stereoisomer may be obtained by resolution
of the racemic mixture using a method such as formation of
diastereomers using optically active resolving agents (“Ste-
reochemistry of Carbon Compounds,” (1962) by E. L. Eliel,
McGraw Hill; Lochmuller, C. H., (1975) J. Chromatogr,
113:(3) 283-302). Racemic mixtures of chiral compounds of
the invention can be separated and isolated by any suitable
method, including: (1) formation of ionic, diastereomeric
salts with chiral compounds and separation by fractional
crystallization or other methods, (2) formation of diastereo-
meric compounds with chiral derivatizing reagents, separa-
tion of the diastereomers, and conversion to the pure ste-
reoisomers, and (3) separation of the substantially pure or
enriched stereoisomers directly under chiral conditions.

[0197] “Diastereomer” refers to a stereoisomer with two
or more centers of chirality and whose molecules are not
mirror images of one another. Diastereomers have different
physical properties, e.g. melting points, boiling points, spec-
tral properties, and reactivities. Mixtures of diastereomers
may separate under high resolution analytical procedures
such as electrophoresis and chromatography.

[0198] As discussed above, the compounds used to pre-
pare the compositions of the present invention may be in the
form of a phannaceutically acceptable free base. Because
the free base of the compound is generally less soluble in
aqueous solutions than the salt, free base compositions are
employed to provide more sustained release of active agent
to the lungs An active agent present in the lungs in particu-
late form which has not dissolved into solution is not
available to induce a physiological response, but serves as a
depot of bioavailable drug which gradually dissolves into
solution.

[0228] The compounds of Formula I may also be used in
conjunction with osmolytes thus lowering the dose of the
compound needed to hydrate mucosal surfaces. This impor-
tant property means that the compound will have a lower
tendency to cause undesired side-effects. Active osmolytes
of the present invention are molecules or compounds that are
osmotically active (i.e., are “osmolytes”), “Osmotically
active” compounds of the present invention are membrane-
impermeable (i e, essentially non-absorbable) on the airway
or pulmonary epithelial surface. The terms “airway surface”
and “pulmonary surface,” as used herein, include pulmonary
airway surfaces such as the bronchi and bronchioles, alveo-
lar surfaces, and nasal and sinus surfaces. Active compounds
of the present invention may be ionic osmolytes (i.e,, salts),
or may be non-ionic osmolytes (ire, sugars, sugar alcohols,
and organic osmolytes). It is speciﬁcally intended that both
racemic forms of the active compounds that are racemic in
nature are included in the group of active compounds that
are useful in the present invention. It is to be noted that all
racemates, enantiomers, diastereomers, tautomers, poly-
morphs and pseudopolymorphs and racemic mixtures of the
osmotically active compounds are embraced by the present
invention.

[0229] Active compounds of the present invention may be
ionic osmolytes (i.e., salts). or may be non-ionic osmolytes
(i.e., sugars, sugar alcohols, and organic osmolytes). It is

compounds that are racemic in nature are included in the
group of active compounds that are useful in the present
invention. It is to be noted that all racemates, enantiomers,
diastereomers, tautomers, polymorphs and pseudopoly-
morphs and racemic mixtures of the osmotically active
compounds are embraced by the present invention.

[0230] Active osmolytes useful in the present invention
that are ionic osmolytes include any salt of a pharmaceuti-
cally acceptable anion and a pharmaceutically acceptable
cation. Preferably, either (or both) of the anion and cation are
non-absorbable (i.e., osmotically active and not subject to
rapid active transport) in relation to the airway surfaces to
which they are administered, Such compounds include but
are not limited to anions and cations that are contained in
FDA approved commercially marketed salts, see, e.g., Rem-
ington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy, Vol. 11, pg,
1457 (19.sup.th Ed. 1995), incorporated herein by reference,
and can be used in any combination including their conven-
tional combinations.

sium, potassium, sodium, zinc, iron, ammonium, and the
like. Particularly preferred cations include sodium, potas-
sium, choline, lithium, meglumine, D-lysine, ammonium,
magnesium, and calcium,

[0233] Specific examples of osmotically active salts that
may be used with t e sodium channel blockers described
herein to carry out the present invention include, but are not
limited to, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, choline
chloride, choline iodide, lithium chloride, meglumine chlo-
ride, L-lysine chloric e, D-lysine chloride, ammonium chlo-
ride, potassium sulfate, potassium nitrate, potassium glu-
conate, potassium iodide, ferric chloride, ferrous chloride,
potassium bromide, etc. Either a single salt or a combination
of different osmotica ly active salts may be used to carry out
the present invention. Combinations of different salts are
preferred. When dilferent salts are used, one of the anion or
cation may be the same among the differing salts.

[0234] Osmotically active compounds of the present
invention also incluce non-ionic osmolytes such as sugars,
sugar-alcohols, and organic osmolytes. Sugars and sugar-
alcohols useful in the practice of the present invention
include but are not limited to 3-carbon sugars (e.g., glycerol,
dihydroxyacetone); 4-carbon sugars (e.g., both the D and L
forms of erythrose, t‘rreose, and erythrulose); 5-carbon sug-
ars (e.g., both the D and L forms of ribose, arabinose, xylose,
lyxose, psicose, fructose, sorbose, and tagatose); and 6-car-
bon sugars (e.g., both the D and L forms of altose, allose,
glucose, mannose, gulose, idose, galactose, and talose, and
the D and L forms of allo-heptulose, allo-hepulose, gluco-
heptulose, manno-heptulose, gulo-heptulose, ido-heptulose,
galacto-heptulose, talo-heptulose). Additional sugars useful
in the practice of the present invention include rafﬁnose,
raﬁinose series oligosaccharides, and stachyose. Both the D
and L forms of the reduced form of each sugar/sugar alcohol
useful in the present invention are also active compounds
within the scope of the invention. For example, glucose,
when reduced, becomes sorbitol; within the scope of the
invention, sorbitol and other reduced forms of sugar/sugar
alcohols (erg, mannitol, dulcitol, arabitol) are accordingly
active compounds of the present invention,

[0235] Osmotically active compounds of the present
invention additionally include the family of non-ionic osmo-
lytes termed “organic osmolytes.” The term “organic osmo-
lytes" is generally used to refer to molecules used to control
intracellular osmolality in the kidney, See e.g,, J, S. Handler
et al., Comp, Biochem. Physiol, 117, 301-306 (1997); M.
Burg, Am. .li Physioli 268, F983-F996 (1995), each incor-
porated herein by reference. Although the inventor does not
wish to be bound to any particular theory of the invention,
it appears that these organic osmolytes are useful in con-
US 2019/0031679 A1

trolling extracellular volume on the airway/pulmonary sur-
face. Organic osmolytes useful as active compounds in the
present invention include but are not limited to three major
classes of compounds: polyols (polyhydric alcohols), meth-
ylamines, and amino acids. The polyol organic osmolytes
considered useful in the practice of this invention include,
but are not limited to, inositol, myo-inositol, and sorbitol,
The methylamine organic osmolytes useful in the practice of
the invention include, but are not limited to, choline, betaine,
carnitine (L-, D- and DL forms), phosphorylcholine, lyso-
phosphorylcholine, glycerophosphorylcholine, creatine, and
creatine phosphate, The amino acid organic osmolytes of the
invention include, but are not limited to, the D- and L-forms
of glycine, alanine, glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, proline
and taurine, Additional osmolytes useful in the practice of
the invention include tihulose and sarcosine. Mammalian
organic osmolytes are preferred, with human organic osmo-
lytes being most preferred However, certain organic osmo-
lytes are of bacterial, yeast, and marine animal origin, and
these compounds are also useful active compounds within
the scope of the present invention,

[0236] Under certain circumstances, an osmolyte precur-
sor may be administered to the subject; accordingly, these
compounds are also useful in the practice of the invention,
The term “osmolyte precursor” as used herein refers to a
compound which is converted into an osmolyte by a meta-
bolic step, either catabolic or anabolic, The osmolyte pre-
cursors of this invention include, but are not limited to,
glucose, glucose polymers, glycerol, choline, phosphatidyl-
choline, lyso-phosphatidylcholine and inorganic phosphates,
which are precursors of polyols and methylamines, Precur-
sors of amino acid osmolytes within the scope of this
invention include proteins, peptides, and polyamino acids,
which are hydrolyzed to yield osmolyte amino acids, and
metabolic precursors which can be converted into osmolyte
amino acids by a metabolic step such as transamination. For
example, a precursor of the amino acid glutamine is poly-
L-glutamine, and a precursor of glutamate is poly-L-gluta-
mic acid.

directly regulates the hydration level of the mucosal surface,
Importantly, sodium absorption through the epithelial
sodium channel (ENaC) provides the rate-limiting step in
hydration, In human subjects with loss of function mutation
in ENaC have ‘wet’ airway surfaces and extraordinarily fast
mucous clearance (Kerern et all, N Iingl J Med 1999 Juli 15;
341(3)2156-62)i Conversely, increased sodium absorption
through ENaC has been shown to be the underlying cause of
mucous dehydration and the formation of mucous plugs in
the lungs CF patients. Furthermore, transgenic mice that
overexpress ENaC in the lungs have dehydrated airway
surfaces and reduced/absent mucous clearance that results in
death (Humrnler et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA. 1997 Oct,
14; 94(21):]1710-5) As predicted from clinical and experi-
mental data, phar'rnacological blockade of ENaC conserves
liquid on airway surfaces and increases mucus clearance
(Hirsh et al., J Pharmacol Exp Ther. 2008; 325(1):77-88),

[0217] Based on these results, it is believed that decreas-
ing the residual radiological dose further by any method or
combination of methods for enhancing the clearance of
particles from the lung would further decrease the probabil-
ity of health effects to lung, However, BAL is a procedure
that has many drawbacks BAL is a highly invasive proce-
dure that must be performed at specialized medical centers
by trained pulmonologists. As such, a BAL procedure is
expensive. Given the drawbacks of BAL, it is not a treatment
option that would be readily and immediately available to
persons in need of accelerated removal of radioactive par-
ticles, for example, in the event of a nuclear attack, In the
event of a nuclear attack or a nuclear accident, immediate
and relatively easily administered treatment for persons who
have been exposed or who are at risk of being exposed is
needed Sodium channel blockers administered as an inha-
lation aerosol have been shown to restore hydration of
airway surfaces Such hydration of airway surfaces aids in
clearing accumulated mucus secretions and associated par-
ticulate matter from the lung. As such, without being bound
by any particular theory, it is believed that sodium channel
blockers can be used in combination with mucolytic agents
described in this invention to accelerate the removal of
radioactive particles from airway passages,

[0218] As discussed above, the greatest risk to the lungs
following a radiological attack, such as a dirty bomb, results
from the inhalation and retention of insoluble radioactive
particles. As a result of radioactive particle retention, the
cumulative exposure to the lung is signiﬁcantly increased,
ultimately resulting in pulmonary ﬁbrosis/pneumonitis and
potentially death, Insoluble particles cannot be systemically
cleared by chelating agents because these particles are not in
solution. To date, the physical removal of particulate matter
through BAL is the only therapeutic regimen shown to be
effective at mitigating radiation-induced lung disease. As
discussed above, BAL is not a realistic treatment solution for
reducing the effects of radioactive particles that have been
inhaled into the body. As such, it is desirable to provide a
therapeutic regimen that effectively aids in clearing radio-
active particles from airway passages and that, unlike BAL,
is relatively simple to administer and scalable in a large-
scale radiation exposure scenario. In addition, it is also
desirable that the therapeutic regimen be readily available to
a number of people in a relatively short period of time.

[0219] In an aspect of the present invention, a method for
preventing, mitigating, and/or treating deterministic health
effects to the respiratory tract and/or other bodily organs
caused by respirable aerosols containing radionuclides com-
prises administering an effective amount of a mucolytic
agent of Formula I or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt
thereof to an individual in need, In a feature of this aspect,
the mucolytic agent is administered in conjunction with an
osmolyte. With further regard to this feature, the osmolyte is
hypertonic saline. In a further feature, the mucolytic agent
and the osmolyte are administered in conjunction with an
ion transport modulator With further regard to this feature,
the ion transport modulator may be selected from the group
consisting of B-agonists, CFTR potentiators, purinergic
receptor agonists, lubiprostones, and protease inhibitors, In
another feature of this aspect, the radionuclides are selected
from the group consisting of Colbalt-60, Cesium-137,
Iridium-192, Radium-226, Phospohrus-32, Strontium-89
and 90, Iodine-125, Thallium-201, Lead-210, Thorium-234,
Uranium-238, Plutonium, Cobalt-58, Chromium-51, Ameri-

cium, and Curium. In a further feature, the radionuclides are
from a radioactive disposal device. In yet another feature,
the mucolytic agent or phannaceutically acceptable salt
thereof is administered in an aerosol suspension of respi-
rable particles which the individual inhales. In an additional
feature, the mucolytic agent or a pharrnaceutically accept-
able salt thereof is administered post-exposure to the radio-
nuclides.

[0220] The present invention is concemed primarily with
the treatment of human subjects, but may also be employed
for the treatment of other mammalian subjects, such as dogs
and cats, for veterinary purposes.

[0221] Another aspect of the present invention is a phar-
maceutical composition, comprising a compound of formula
I in a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier (e.g., an aqueous
carrier solution). In general, the compound of formula I is
included in the composition in an amount effective to reduce
the viscosity of mucus on mucosal surfaces.

Mucolytic Combination Therapies:

[0222] An aspect of the present invention is the COMBI-
NATION of mucolytic agents with other drugs or excipients
to improve the efﬁcacy and tolerability of the compounds
described in this invention.

[0223] In one embodiment of this invention, mucolytic
agents are utilized to provide access to other therapeutic
agents through the mucus layer to the airway epithelium,
Mucus forms a diffusion barrier which can prevent thera-
peutic molecules from reaching their intended site of action.
[0224] The access of the following therapeutic agents to
their site of action in the airway epithelium could be
enhanced by the pre- or co-treatrnent with the mucolytic
agents described in this invention.

[0225] In one embodiment of this invention, mucolytic
agents are utilized in combination with other therapies or
small molecule drugs to provide and advantageous additive
or synergistic beneﬁt.

Mucolytic Combinations with Osmotically Active Agents:
[0226] Another aspect of the present invention is admin-
istering reducing agents in combination with osmolytes. A
simple means to restore airway surface hydration in subjects
with muco—obstructive diseases is to inhale hypertonic
osmolyte solutions (most frequently 7% hypertonic saline
(HS)), which draws water onto the airway surface. Rehy-
dration of the lubricant periciliary layer (PCL) of the airway
surface facilitates mucus clearance and, therefore, the
removal of inhaled infectious agents, Mucus rehydration
achieved by the administration of hypertonic solutions and
disruption of mucus polymers by reducing agents is
expected to produce a synergistic reduction in mucus vis-
cosity and elasticity, improving the transportability and
clearance of mucus.

[0227] Inhaled HS is a unique therapeutic agent as it is
used by ~60% of CF patients nationwide, but is not FDA
approved for daily use for pulmonary disease. As such, HS
has not undergone the rigorous clinical testing to identify the
dose and dosing frequency that are most eﬂicacious and well
tolerated. Instead, the HS regime has been optimized in
practice by patients and physicians, Most commonly, HS is
administered as two 15 minute inhalation treatments of 4 mL
of 7% hypertonic saline per treatment. The tonicity of HS
used by patients (7% NaCl) has been identiﬁed as a maxi-
mum concentration that is generally tolerated (i.e. minimal
irritation or bronchoconstriction).

Prodrugs of Monothiol Mucolytics:

[0199] Many modern drugs are discovered through high-
throughput screening or combinatorial chemistry. These

Jan. 3], 2019

compounds often are selected for their high pharmacological
eﬁicacy but unintentionally have poor drug-like character-
istics (e.g., solubility, bioavailability, stability). One strategy
to overcome these physiochemical, biopharmaceutical, and
pharmacokinetic limitations is to use a prodrug form of the
compound, a molecule that is inactive until undergoing an
enzymatic or chemical transformation in vivo. Depending
on the type of modiﬁcation, prodrugs can have key advan-
tages over their active counterparts: (1) increased stability
and shelf-life, (2) increased aqueous solubility, (3) improved
bioavailability, (4) increased lipophilicity/permeability, and
(5) improved parenteral administration.

[0200] Of the drugs approved worldwide, 5-7% can be
classiﬁed as prodnlgs. These drugs are classiﬁed into two
categories, bioprecurser prodrugs or carrier-linked prodrugs.
Bioprecurser prodrugs are convened into pharmacologically
active drugs by metabolic or chemical transformation Car-
rier-linked prodrugs have a promoiety that is covalently
linked to an active parent molecule. This promoiety is
released, usually by enzymatic hydrolysis, activating the
parent molecule once delivered to the therapeutic location.
Design of the prodrug moiety is usually based on the
drug-like characteristics that need improvement in a par-
ticular molecule, the available functional groups that are
amenable to a promoiety, and the targeted organ or tissue. In
cases where the promoiety cannot be directly attached due to
reasons such as steric hinderance, spacers or linkers are also
added. In order to be well-tolerated, the promoiety should be
non-immunogenic, stable until reaching the therapeutic tis-
sue, and rapidly excreted from the body, once cleaved from
the parent, Esters are one of the most commonly used
promoieties, due to their ease of removal from the parent
drug by ubiquitous esterases (e.g., acetylcholinesterases,
butyrylcholinesterases, carboxylesterases, arlesterases),
capability of increasing drug solubility by masking charge
groups, such as carboxylic acids and phophates, and rela-
tively simple synthesis. Some other common functional
groups that are utilized as promoieties are: carbonates,
carbamates, amides, phosphates, and oximes.

[0201] Prodrugs could be particularly useful as inhaled
therapeutics for muco-obstructive respiratory diseases, such
as chronic bronchitis (CB), including the most common
lethal genetic form of chronic bronchitis, cystic ﬁbrosis
(CF). We also hypothesized that additional molecular fea-
tures can improve tolerability and duration of action of the
monothiol mucolytics.

[0202] Speciﬁcally, we developed mucolytic pro-drugs, by
integrating enzymatically labile, thiol-capping groups.
These pro-drug mucolytic agents are advantageous in that:
1) they are completely inactive, and therefore, protected
from auto-oxidation in solution; 2) the thiol protecting
groups render the compounds completely odorless; and 3)
the molecules can be designed to alter the rate of activation
in vivo and can, therefore, be used to slow compound
activation and to extend the duration of pharmacological
action.

[0203] The present invention provides a series of muco-
lytic pro-drugs (see R6:other than H) that are activated by
common enzymes that are present in the extracellular milieu
(e.g., nucelotidases, phosphatases, and esterases). As a
proof-of-concept, the reducing kinetics of the pro-drug com-
pound 46 in the presence or absence of an activating esterase
were tested. Under the conditions tested, 46 alone does not
reduce disulﬁde

formula (l-Vll) to the lungs of an individual in need of such
treatment against infection from an airborne pathogen. Tie
pathogens which may be protected against by the proph -
lactic post exposure, rescue and therapeutic treatment meti-
ods of the invention include any pathogens which may enter
the body through the mouth, nose or nasal airways, thus
proceeding into the lungs Typically, the pathogens will e
airborne pathogens, either naturally occurring or by aero-
solization. The pathogens may be naturally occurring or may
have been introduced into the environment intentiona ly
aﬁer aerosolization or other method of introducing tie
pathogens into the environment, Many pathogens which are
not naturally transmitted in the air have been or may e
aerosolized for use in bioterrorism. The pathogens for which
the treatment of the invention may be useful includes, but is
not limited to, category A, B and C priority pathogens as set
forth by the NIAID. These categories correspond genera 1y
to the lists compiled by the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC). As set up by the CDC, Category A agents
are those that can be easily disseminated or transmitted
person-to-person, cause higi mortality, with potential or
major public health impact. Category B agents are next in
priority and include those that are moderately easy to
disseminate and cause moderate morbidity and low mortal-
ity Category C consists of emerging pathogens that could e
engineered for mass dissemination in the future because of
their availability, ease of production and dissemination and
potential for high morbidity and mortality. Particu ar
examples of these pathogens are anthrax and plague. Ad i-
tional pathogens which may be protected against or tie
infection risk therefrom reduced include inﬂuenza viruses,
rhinoviruses, adenoviruses and respiratory syncytial viruses,
and the like A further pathogen which may be protected
against is the coronavirus which is believed to cause severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

[0211] The present invention also relates to the use of
mucolytic agents of Formula I, or a pharmaceutically accept-
able salt thereof, for preventing, mitigating, and/or treating
deterministic health effects to the respiratory tract caused by
exposure to radiological materials, particularly respirable
aerosols containing radionuclides from nuclear attacks, such
as detonation of radiological dispersal devices (RDD), or
accidents, such as nuclear power plant disasters As such,
provided herein is a method for preventing, mitigating,
and/or treating deterministic health effects to the respiratory
tract and/or other bodily organs caused by respirable aero-
sols containing radionuclides in a recipient in need thereof,
including in a human in need thereof, said method compris-
ing administering to said human an effective amount of a
compound of Formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable
salt thereof.

[0212] A major concern associated with consequence
management planning for exposures of members of the
public to respirable aerosols containing radionuclides from
nuclear attacks, such as detonation of radiological dispersal
devices (RDD), or accidents, such as nuclear power plant
disasters is how to prevent, mitigate or treat potential
deterministic health effects to the respiratory tract, primarily
the lung. It is necessary to have drugs, techniques and
procedures, and trained personnel prepared to manage and
treat such highly internally contaminated individuals,

[0213] Research has been conducted to determine ways in
which to prevent, mitigate or treat potential damage to the
respiratory tract and various organs in the body that is

 

 

Jan. 31, 2019

caused by internally deposited radionuclides To date, most
of the research attention has focused on strategies designed
to mitigate health effects from internally deposited radionu-
clides by accelerating their excretion or removal. These
strategies have focused on soluble chemical forms that are
capable of reaching the blood stream and are deposited at
remote systemic sites speciﬁc to a given radioelement, Such
approaches will not work in cases where the deposited
radionuclide is in relatively insoluble form. Studies have
shown that many, if not most of the physicochemical forms
of dispersed radionuclides from RDDs, will be in relatively
insoluble form.

[0214] The only method known to effectively reduce the
radiation dose to the lungs from inhaled insoluble radioac-
tive aerosols is bronchoalveolar lavage or BAL, This tech-
nique, which was adapted from that already in use for the
treatment of patients with alveolar proteinosis, has been
shown to be a safe, repeatable procedure, even when per-
formed over an extended period of time. Although there are
variations in procedure, the basic method for BAL is to
anaesthetize the subject, followed by the slow introduction
of isotonic saline into a single lobe of the lung until the
function residual capacity is reached. Additional volumes
are then added and drained by gravity.

[0215] The results of studies using BAL on animals indi-
cate that about 40% of the deep lung content can be removed
by a reasonable sequence of BALs. In some studies, there
was considerable variability among animals in the amount of
radionuclide recovered. The reasons for the variability are
currently not understood.

[0216] Further, based on a study on animals, it is believed
that a signiﬁcant dose reduction from BAL therapy results in
mitigation of health effects due to inhalation of insoluble
radionuclides. In the study, adult dogs inhaled insoluble
144Ce-FAP particles Two groups of dogs were given lung
contents of 144Ce known to cause radiation pneumonitis and
pulmonary ﬁbrosis (about 2 MBq/kg body mass), with one
group being treated with 10 unilateral lavages between 2 and
56 days after exposure, the other untreated. A third group
was exposed at a level of 144Ce comparable to that seen in
the EAL-treated group aﬁer treatment (about 1 MBq/kg),
but these animals were untreated. All animals were allowed
to live their lifespans, which extended to 16 years. Because
there is variability in initial lung content of 144Ce among the
dogs in each group, the dose rates and cumulative doses for
each group overlap. Nevertheless, the effect of BAL in
reducing the risk from pneumonitis/ﬁbrosis was evident
from the survival curves. In the untreated dogs with lung
contents of 1.5-2.5 MBq/kg, the mean survival time was
370165 d. For the treated dogs, the mean survival was
12701240 d, which was statistically signiﬁcantly different,
The third group, which received lung contents of 144Ce of
0.6-1.4 MBq had a mean survival time of 18001230, which
was not statistically different from the treated group. Equally
important to the increased survival, the do gs in the high-dose
untreated group died from deterministic effects to lung
(pneumonitis/ﬁbrosis) while the treated dogs did not,
Instead, the treated dogs, like the dogs in the low-dose
untreated group, mostly had lung tumors (hemangiosarcoma
or carcinoma). Therefore, the reduction in dose resulting
from BAL treatment appears to have produced biological
etfects in lung that were predictable based on the radiation
doses that the lungs received.

invention are present to a recursive degree. In this context,
“recursive substituent” means that a substituent may recite
another instance of itself. Because of the recursive nature of
such substituents, theoretically, a large number of com-
pounds may be present in any given embodiment. For
example, R9 contains a R13 substituent. R13 can contain an
R10 substituent and R10 can contain a R9 substituent One of
ordinary skill in the art of medicinal chemistry understands
that the total number of such substituents is reasonably
limited by the desired properties of the compound intended.
Such properties include, by way of example and not lirni-
tation, physical properties such as molecular weight, solu-

General Procedure:

[0341] All reagent and solvents were purchased from
Aldrich Chemical Corp. Chem-Impex International Inc. and
TCI chemical industry Co. Ltd. NMR spectra were obtained
on either a Bruker A C 400 (‘H NMR at 400 MHz) or a
Bruker A C 300 (‘H NMR at 300 MHz). Solvents CDC13,
CDSOD and DMSO-d6 were purchased from Aldrich or
Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, unless otherwise speciﬁed.
Chemical shifts are reported in ppm relative to tetrameth-
ylsilane (TMS) as the internal standard. Data is reported as
follows: chemical shift, integration, multiplicity (s:singlet,
d:doublet, tmiplet, q:quartet, bemai m:multiplet), and
coupling constants (Hz). Flash chromatography was per-
formed on a Combiﬂash system (Combiﬂash Rf, Teledyne
Isco) charged with silica gel column (Redi Sep. Rf, Teledyne
Isco) or reverse phase column (High performance C18 Gold
column). ESI Mass spectra were obtained on a Shimadzu

[0386] DTNB Assay:

[0387] Thiol-containing compounds, such as the mono-
thiol mucolytic agents described in this patent, can react
with DTNB (5,5-Dithiobis(2-nitrobenzoic acid)) resulting in
the cleavage of its single s7s bond. The DTNB assay
serves a dual purpose in our analysis of monothiol com-
pounds, as it can (1) be used to determine the “active
concentration” of the mucolytic compounds (what amount
of the compound in a reaction is able to cleave 57S bonds)
and (2) to assess the rate that the compound can cleave 57S
bonds. When cleaved, the resulting compound, NTB (2-ni-
tro-5-thiobenzoate), is a colored product that is measured
spectrophotometrically at an absorbance of 412 nm
(AbsMZ). Using the molar extinction coeﬂicient of NTB and
measured maximum Abst, the molar amount of DTNB
that reacted with our mucolytic agents can be calculated.
Monothiol mucolytic compounds react at a 1:1 stoichiomet-
ric ratio with DTNB (i.e. 1 mole of NTB is produced when
1 mole of DTNB is reacted with 1 mole of a monothiol
reducing agent). To deﬁne the activity concentration of a
compound, a ﬁnal concentration of 22.5 M mucolytic
reducing agent was combined with an excess of DTNB (100
M) in 1 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5). Maximum
Abs412 was measured and then utilized to calculate the
activity concentration. 1f observed activity concentrations
diifered from expected activity concentrations by more than
5%, the amount of the compound added to each reaction was
accordingly adjusted to kinetically test the reducing rate in
the next step. To determine rate of mucolytic reducing
activity, 225 uM active reducing agent is combined with 45
[1M DTNB in 1 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl buEer over a pH range
(6.0-7.5). Abs412 is recorded in real time upon addition of the
compound and rates were calculated using 2"“, order kinetic
parameters. Results are tabulated in Table 1.

[0388] Pro-Drug DTNB Assay:

[0389] This assay was designed to determine whether
prodrug caps added on to our monothiol mucolytic com-
pounds can be cleaved from the molecule. If so, the outcome
would be an “active” compound that is able to reduce the
87s bond in DTNB. Similar to the activity concentration
version of the DTNB assay described above, monothiol
prodrugs were mixed at a ﬁnal concentration of 22.5 JAM
with excess DTNB (100 M ﬁnal) in 1 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl

buEer (pH 7.5) and maximum Abs412 was measured. In the
absence of a puriﬁed hydrolytic enzyme (e.g. porcine liver
esterase; Sigma), the amount of DTNB cleavage observed is
an indicator for stability of the cap on the prodrug compound
(i.e. if the prodrug remains intact in solution the Abs41220).
Next, 5 HL of esterase (bought as an ammonium sulfate
suspension that is subsequently centrifuged to isolate the
esterase and then dissolved in reaction buffer prior to assay-
ing) is combined with excess DTNB (100 uM ﬁnal) and 22.5
uM pro-drug in 1 mL 50 mM Tris-HCl buffer (pH 7.5).
Cleavage of the prodmg cap can be visualized in real time
via DTNB cleavage at Abs),12 by the esterase-liberated
monothiol molecule Resus are tabulated in Table 2.

[0390] Parallel Artiﬁcial Membrane Permeability

(PAMPA) Assay:

[0391] This assay measures the permeability of small
molecules across an artiﬁcial phospholipid membrane to
help predict in vivo drug permeability First, 500 “M stock
solutions were made up in PBS and tested by the DTNB
assay (described above) to determine compound activity
concentrations. Next, 300 [LL of the 500 M compound stock
solution and 200 uL PBS were added per well to the donor
and acceptor plates, respectively (BD GentestTM Pre-Coated
PAMPA Plate System). The acceptor plate was then placed
on top of the donor plate and allowed to incubate at room
temperature for 5 hours. After incubation, the donor and
acceptor plates were separated. For each reaction, samples
were taken from both the acceptor and donor plates and were
combined with DTNB prior to reading spectrophotometri-
cally (maximum Abs412). For prodrug samples, 1 [LL of
puriﬁed esterase (porcine liver esterase; Sigma) was added
per well and the samples were incubated at room tempera-
ture for 5 minutes to allow for cleavage of the pro-drug cap
prior to addition of DTNB. Using the concentrations of
compound identiﬁed in both the donor and acceptor plates
for each sample, a compound permeability parameter was
calculated following equations outlined in the BD GentestTM
Pre-Coated PAMPA Plate System Manual.

[0392] Mucin Agarose Gel Westem Blots:

[0393] Various mucin-containing substrates (e.g. saliva,
harvested HBE mucus, and disease sputum) treated with our
monothiol mucolytic compounds are quenched upon
completion of the treatment period with a 10-fold excess of
N-ethylmaleimide in order to alkylate any remaining active
compound and to prevent further mucin reduction. A 10x
concentrated sample loading buffer is diluted into each
sample (leAE/5% glycerol/0.1% SDS/Bromophenol

Jan. 31, 2019

Blue). Samples (50 ug) were analyzed by electrophoresis on
0.9% agarose gels using a buffer system consisting of
leAE/0.l% SDS. The agarose gel was soaked for 15 min
in 4XSSC (0.6 M NaCl, 60 mM Tri-sodium citrate dehy-
drate) containing 10 mM DTT before transferring the
samples from the gel onto a nitrocellulose membrane by
vacuum blotter. Unreduced and reduced Muc5B were visu-
alized on a LiCor Odyssey imaging detection system using
a polyclonal antibody directed towards Muc5B.

[0394] BiP Induction:

[0395] Reducing agents were made up in 50 mM Tris-HCl
buﬁered to pH 7.5. Each compound solution (15 uL of 10
mM compound) was added to the apical surface of primary
HBEs for 24 hrs. The cells were then lysed in RIPA buffer
(50 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.0)/150 mM NaCl/1.0% NP-40/0.5%
sodium deoxycholate/0.l% SDS) supplemented with pro-
tease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) and 1 mM phenylmethyl-
sulfonyl ﬂuoride. The samples were nomialized to contain
the same total amount of protein followed by addition 0
2><SDS sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl (pH 6.8)/4%
SDS/0.05% Bromophenol Blue/20% glycerol). Samples (20
ug) were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 10% SDS-PAGE
gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. BiP levels
were visualized using a polyclonal antibody directe
towards BiP and the LiCor Odyssey imaging detection
system. Thapsigargin (TG, 2.5 uM) and DTT serve as a
positive control for BiP induction.

[0396] IL—8 Secretion:

[0397] Reducing agents were made up in 50 mM Tris-HC
buﬁered to pH 7.5. Each compound solution (15 uL of 10
mM compound) was added to the apical surface of primary
HBEs.

[0398] IL—8 secretion was measured from the basolatera
HBE media 24 hours post-dose using a ThermoScientiﬁc
human IL-8 ELISA kit. Samples were diluted 1:50 and then
50 [LL of each dilution was added to the ELISA plate. The
samples were completed in duplicate following standarc
reaction conditions as outlined in the kit manual. Absor-
bance was measured at 450 nm. A standard curve, generate
from standards with known amounts of human lL-S, was
used to calculate IL-8 amounts in the unknown samples.
Supernatant from mucopurlent matters (SMM) puriﬁed from
cystic ﬁbrosis sputum was used as a positive control for IL—8
secretion.

[0399] Data using these assays is compiled in FIGS. 2-9
and is discussed in detail as follows: As shown in FIG. 2,
enhanced mucin reducing capabilities of compound 76 rela-
tive to NAC are provided. The novel mucolytic agents
incorporate several features to produce therapeutic agents
with favorable properties relative to currently available
agents. One limitation of NAC, the only approved mucolytic
for inhalation, is its very slow reducing kinetics, requiring
both very high drug concentrations and long incubation
times. Compound 76, a novel mucolytic warhead, demon-
strates signiﬁcantly enhanced kinetics relative to NAC. As
shown by agarose gel western blot, 76 at equirnolar con-
centrations relative to NAC (50 mM) produces a signiﬁ-
cantly faster and more complete reduction of salivary
Muc5b compared to NAC. Furthermore, 76 produces greater
Muc5b reduction relative to NAC at a 5-fold lower concen-
tration (10 mM). Thus, 76 exhibits properties of a more
active reducing agent compared to NAC.

[0400] As shown in FIG. 3, modiﬁcation of Compound 76
can be accomplished without loss of reducing activity. The

functional substitutions of 76, as illustrated by the deriva-
tives 86, 69, and 47, retain the reducing capacity of 76. As
shown in the ﬁgure, all compounds are signiﬁcantly more
active than NAC at reducing MucSB (as indicated by the
loss of the high molecular weight Muc5b band on the
western blot).

[0401] In FIG. 4, the reducing activity of Compound 86
relative to compounds known in the art. By agarose gel
western blot, 86 demonstrates superior Muc5b reducing
activity relative to NAC and another agent known in the art
(compound 95 described in W02014153009). Only 86 pro-
duces full Muc5b reduction at 30 mM and partial reduction
at 3 mM; whereas the other compounds only produce partial
Muc5b reduction at the highest concentration tested (30

[0402] FIG. 5 shows the advantage of compound 76
substitutions A primary limitation of NAC as a pulmonary
mucolytic agent is limited airway surface drug retention (the
Mucomyst product insert describes a pulmonary surface
half-life of 20 minutes), As shown in the ﬁgure the 76
warhead is relatively lipophilic and membrane permeable as
measured using the PAMPA assay. However, substituted 76
molecules, such as 86 and 85 (which retain the enhanced
activity of 76 relative to NAC), are more polar and less
lipophilic, resulting in poor membrane permeability, Thus,
the data predict that 86 and 85 will favorably exhibit
enhanced compound retention on the lung surface.

[0403] FIG. 6 shows integrated assays to assess cell per-
meation and pro-inﬂammatory eﬁects. Compounds were
incubated on the apical surface of polarized HBE cells for 24
hours at 10 mM and the induction of the (A) BiP protein or
(B) IL-8 secretion was measured. Induction of the BiP
protein is a marker for endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress,
which can be caused by the inhibition of disulﬁde bond
formation during protein synthesis, As 86 was predicted to
poorly permeate cells. it was expected that this compound
would not reach the ER and, therefore, not induce BiP
expression, Panel A286 and 69 do not induce BiP expression
relative to vehicle controls (dashed line), whereas a perme-
able reducing agent (DTT) and thapasgargin (TG) do. Thus
the data indicate that 86 and 69 are not signiﬁcantly inter-
nalized in the cell when added to the apical compartment.
Panel B: To assess the potential pro-inﬂammatory properties
of the compounds, IL-8 secretion was measured following
the 24 hour compound incubation. Signiﬁcantly, 86 did not
produce any evidence of pro-inﬂammatory eﬁects as evi-
denced by no change in IL—8. However, 69 did increase lL-S
secretion, along with a positive control (SMM). As 86 and
69 share a common warhead, 76, which did not increase lL-8
secretion, we conclude that the substitutions on 69, but not
86, are responsible for this effect,

[0404] FIG. 7 shows pro—drugs of86, 85 is the thio-acetate
derivative of 86. lmportantly, the pro-drug moiety renders
85 odorless and inactive (until the compound is metaboli-
cally activated). The ﬁgure shows 86 in the DTNB assay,

Jan. 3], 2019

which rapidly cleaves DTNB (left panel), Conversely 85
does not cleave DTNB (middle panel), demonstrating that
the compound is inactive. However, the addition of an
esterase metabolically converts 85 to 86, allowing it to
hydrolyze DTNB (right-hand panel).
[0405] FIG, 8 shows the metabolic activation of 85 in
COPD sputum, An important aspect of mucolytic pro-drugs
is that they must be activated in mucus on the lung surface.
To evaluate the metabolic activation and kinetics, 86 (active
metabolite) and 85 (pro-drug) were incubated from sponta-
neously induced sputum from a patient with COPD. As
shown in the ﬁgure, 86 rapidly reduced Much in the sputum
as assessed by agarose gel western blot, 85 likewise reduces
the Muc5b, but with a delayed kinetic relative to 86 (which
reﬂects the requirement for enzymatic metabolism of 85 to
86). lmportantly, these data demonstrate the human sputum
contains the enzymes required to activate compounds con-
taining thioesters, such as 85.
[0406] FIG, 9 shows the mucus reduction on primary
human bronchial epithelial (HBE) cultures, Mucin reduction
kinetics were assessed by western blot at the indicated times
post-addition of mucolytic agents to the apical surface of
HBE cultures, 86 produces a rapid reduction of the mucus
that is substantially recovered 24 hours after dosing, 85
exhibits slower reduction kinetics (e.g. 1-2 hours), but a
potentially longer duration of action (eg. 24 hours). lmpor—
tantly, the data demonstrate that human airway epithelia with
mucus can metabolize the 85 pro-drug to the active 86
mucolytic agent.

diseases characterized by progressive scarring of the alveo-
lar interstitium that lead to signiﬁcant morbidity and mor-
tality. Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (lPF) is the most com-
mon and most severe form of fIIP with a median survival of
3 years, affects 50,000 individuals annually in the US, and
will increase in prevalence as our population ages (G.
Raghu, D. Weycker, J. Edelsberg, W Z. Bradford, G. Oster,
Incidence and prevalence of idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
Am J Respir Crit Care Med 174, 810 (Oct. 1, 2006),
Importantly, most previously attempted therapies have been
targeted at the ﬁbroproliferative matrix in IPF, but these have
proven ineffective. Rare mutations have been associated
with IPF, however, these variants account for a small pro-
portion of the attributable risk. A recent discovery that
MUCSB is a highly signiﬁcant and common genetic risk
factor for established IPF (M. A. Seibold et al., A common
MUCSB promoter polymorphism and pulmonary ﬁbrosis. N
Engl J Med 364, 1503 (Apr. 21, 2011).) suggests that the
MUCSB variant has the potential to detect preclinical or
mild disease. Thus, the present invention may be used to
treat an underlying defect in MUCSB in pulmonary ﬁbrosis.
[0209] The present invention may be used to improve
mucus clearance other than airway surfaces. Such other
mucosal surfaces include gastrointestinal surfaces, oral sur-
faces, genito-urethral surfaces, and ocular surfaces or sur-
faces of the eye. For example, the active compounds of the
present invention may be administered by any suitable
means, including locally/topically, orally, or rectally, in an
effective amount.

[0210] In another aspect, a post-exposure prophylactic
treatment or therapeutic treatment method is provided for
treating infection from an airborne pathogen comprising

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
INVENTION

[0134] As used herein, the following terms are deﬁned as
indicated.

[0135] “A compound of the invention” means a compound
of Formula I or a salt, particularly a pharmaceutically
acceptable salt thereof.

[0136] “A compound of Formula I” means a compound
having the stnictural formula designated herein as Formula
I, Compounds of Formula I include solvates and hydrates
(i,e,, adducts ofa compound of Formula I with a solvent), In
those embodiments wherein a compound of Formula I
includes one or more chiral centers, the phrase is intended to
encompass each individual stereoisomer including optical
isomers (enantiomers and diastereomers) and geometric
isomers (cis-ltrans-isomerism) and mixtures of stereoiso-
mers, In addition, compounds of Formula I also include
tautomers of the depicted formula(s).

[0137] Throughout the description and examples, com-
pounds are named using standard IUPAC naming principles,
where possible, including the use of the ChemDraw Ultra
11.0 software program for naming compounds, sold by
CambridgeSoﬁ Corp/PerkinElmer,

[0138] In some chemical structure representations where
carbon atoms do not have a sufﬁcient number of attached
variables depicted to produce a valence of four, the remain-
ing carbon substituents needed to provide a valence of four
should be assumed to be hydrogen. Similarly, in some
chemical structures where a bond is drawn without speci-
fying the terminal group, such bond is indicative of a methyl
(Me, iCHz) group, as is conventional in the art,

[0139] The present invention is based on the discovery
that the compounds of Formula I are more potent arid/or,
absorbed less rapidly, achieve higher concentrations and
have higher residence time in the mucosal surfaces, espe-
cially airway surfaces, and/or are better tolerated compared
to NAC and DTT. Therefore, the compounds of Formula I
US 2019/0031679 A]

have a greater activity and/or produce less cellular toxicity
on mucosal surfaces as compared to NAC,

[0140] The present invention is based on the discovery
that the compounds of formula (I) are more potent and/or,
absorbed less rapidly from mucosal surfaces, especially
airway surfaces, and/or less reversible from interactions as
compared to compounds such as NAC.

[0141] Therefore, the compounds of formula (I) have a
longer half-life on rnucosal surfaces as compared to these
compounds.

based bronchodilator agents (Duringer et al., Br J Pharma-
coli, 158(1):]69-79 (2009)). High concentration of these
receptor agonist agents leads to the receptor phosphory-
lation, internalization and potential degradation. Adminis-
tration of receptor agonists, which cause tachyphylaxis
following bolus administration via fast nebulizer, by inha-
lation over the course of 8 to 24 hours or overnight to a
patient via nasal cannula improves the efﬁcacy of such
agents due to decreased extent of tachyphylaxis. Beta
2-adrenergic receptor agonists include albuterol, leval-
buterol, salbutamol, procaterol, terbutaline, pirbuterol, and
metaproterenol. The therapeutic efficacy of beta 2-adrener-
gic receptor agonists can be enhanced by the pre- or co-
administration of compounds and methods of this invention.
Mucolytic Combinations with Exemplary Gene Carriers:
[0274] Examples of gene carriers for the administration of
gene therapy include viruses, DNA2protein complexes, plas-
mids, DNAs, and RNAs,

Mucoly‘tic Combinations with Other Exemplary Therapeutic
Agents:

[0275] Examples of other classes of therapeutic agents
suitable for administration in combination with the methods
and molecules described in the present invention include
antivirals such as ribavirin, anti-fungal agents such as
amphotericin, intraconazol and voriconazol, immunosup-
pressants, anti-rejection drugs such as cyclosporine, tacroli-
mus and sirolimus, bronchodilators including but not limited
to anticholinergic agents such as ipratropium, tiotropium,
aclidinium and others, PDES inhibitors siRNAs, gene
therapy vectors, aptamers, endothelin-receptor antagonists,

NOVEL MONOTHIOL MUCOLYTIC AGENTS

CONTINUING APPLICATION INFORMATION

[0001] The present application claims beneﬁt to US
Provisional Application Ser No. 62/109,999, ﬁled on Jan.
30, 2015, and incorporated herein by reference.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

Field of the Invention

[0002] The present invention relates to novel monothiol
mucolytic agents. The present invention also includes a
variety of methods of treatment using these inventive muco-
lytic agents.

Description of the Background

[0003] The mucosal surfaces at the interface between the
environment and the body have evolved a number of “innate
defense”, i.e., protective mechanisms. The mucus transport
system is the fundamental defense of the airways against
inhaled particulates/infectious agents. Inhaled particles are
trapped in the mucus layer and subsequently propelled out of
the lungs via mucus clearance. The mucus transport system
requires that mucus be well hydrated to facilitate cilliary
clearance. In the absence of suﬂicient mucus hydration, the
mucus becomes excessively viscous and adherent, which
can lead to airway mucus accumulation and infection.
[0004] Typically, the quantity of the liquid layer on a
mucosal surface reﬂects the balance between epithelial
liquid secretion, often reﬂecting anion (Cl' and/or HCOS)
secretion coupled with water (and a cation counter-ion), and
epithelial liquid absorption, often reﬂecting Na+ absorption,
coupled with water and counter anion (Cl‘ and/or HCOS).
Many diseases of mucosal surfaces are caused by too little
protective liquid on those mucosal surfaces created by an
imbalance between secretion (too little) and absorption
(relatively too much). The defective salt transport processes
that characterize these mucosal dysfunctions reside in the
epithelial layer of the mucosal surface.

[0005] Abnormalities in the mucus transport system char-
acterize a complex of muco-obstructive airway diseases that
include cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) and chronic bronchitis (CB).
Normal mucus clearance requires 1) adequate hydration of
the airway surface and 2) an absence of strong adhesive and
cohesive interactions between mucus and cell surface.
Hydration is deﬁned by the concentrations of mucins in the
periciliary and mucus layers. lon transport properties regu-
late the amount of salt and water (i.e. the solvent) and goblet
cells and glands control the quantity of mucins on the airway
surface. Subjects with mucus-obstructive diseases including
cystic ﬁbrosis (CF), chronic bronchitis associated with ciga-
rette smoke exposure, i.e., COPD, and asthma exhibit
increases in mucus concentration as quantiﬁed by % solids
(see FIG. 1), as a result of reduced airway hydration and
mucin hypersecretion, consequent to goblet cell and glan-
dular hyperplasia. Both as a function of disease severity, and
in acute exacerbations, raised mucin concentrations produce
adherent mucus that sticks to epithelial cells, impairs clear-
ance, triggering inﬂammatory responses and airway wall
injury, and serves as a growth medium for pathogenic
microorganisms. Clearly, enhancing the clearance of such
thickened/adhered mucus from the airways is likely to
beneﬁt patients with mucus-obstructive diseases.

Jan. 3], 2019

[0006] Chronic bronchitis (CB), including the most com-
mon lethal genetic form of chronic bronchitis, cystic ﬁbrosis
(CF), are diseases that reﬂect the body’s failure to clear
mucus normally from the lungs, which ultimately produces
chronic airways infection In the normal lung, the primary
defense against chronic intrapulmonary airways infection
(chronic bronchitis) is mediated by the continuous clearance
of mucus from bronchial airway surfaces. This function in
health effectively removes from the lung potentially noxious
toxins and pathogens. Recent data indicate that the initiating
problem, i.e., the “basic defect," in both CB and CF is the
failure to clear mucus from airway surfaces. The failure to
clear mucus reﬂects an imbalance between the amount of
liquid and mucin on airway surfaces. This “airway surface
liquid” (ASL) is primarily composed of salt and water in
proportions similar to plasma (i.e., isotonic). Mucin macro-
molecules organize into a well-deﬁned “mucus layer” which
normally traps inhaled bacteria and is transported out of the
lung via the actions of cilia which beat in a watery, low
viscosity solution termed the “periciliary liquid” (PCL). In
the disease state, there is an imbalance in the quantities of
mucus and ASL on airway surfaces. This results in a relative
reduction in ASL which leads to mucus concentration,
reduction in the lubricant activity of the PCL, and a failure
to clear mucus via ciliary activity to the mouth. The reduc-
tion in mechanical clearance of mucus from the lung leads
to chronic bacterial colonization of mucus adherent to
airway surfaces. It is the chronic retention of bacteria, the
failure of local antimicrobial substances to kill mucus-
entrapped bacteria on a chronic basis, and the consequent
chronic inﬂammatory responses of the body to this type of
surface infection, that lead to the syndromes of CB and CF.

[0007] The current aﬂlicted population in the US. is
12,000,000 patients with the acquired (primarily from ciga-
rette smoke exposure) form of chronic bronchitis and
approximately 30,000 patients with the genetic form, cystic
ﬁbrosis. Approximately equal numbers of both populations
are present in Europe. In Asia, there is little CF but the
incidence of CB is high and, like the rest of the world, is
increasing.

[0008] There is currently a large, unmet medical need for
products that speciﬁcally treat CB and CF at the level of the
basic defect that cause these diseases. The current therapies
for chronic bronchitis and cystic ﬁbrosis focus on treating
the symptoms anrﬂor the late eifects of these diseases. Thus,
for chronic bronchitis, ﬁ-agonists, inhaled steroids, anti-
cholinergic agents, and oral theophyllines and phosphodi-
esterase inhibitors are all in development. However, none of
these drugs treat effectively the fundamental problem of the
failure to clear mucus from the lung. Similarly, in cystic
ﬁbrosis, the same spectrum of pharmacologic agents is used.
These strategies have been complemented by more recent
strategies designed to clear the CF lung of the DNA (“Pul-
mozyme”; Genentech) that has been deposited in the lung by
neutrophils that have futilely attempted to kill the bacteria
that grow in adherent mucus masses and through the use of
inhaled antibiotics (“TOBI”) designed to augment the lungs”
own killing mechanisms to rid the adherent mucus plaques
of bacteria. A general principle of the body is that if the
initiating lesion is not treated, in this case mucus retention]
obstruction, bacterial infections became chronic and increas-
ingly refractory to antimicrobial therapy. Thus, a major
unmet therapeutic need for both CB and CF lung diseases is
US 2019/0031679 A1

an effective means of mobilizing airway mucus and promot-
ing its clearance, with bacteria, from the lung.

[0009] Other mucosal surfaces in and on the body exhibit
subtle differences in the normal physiology of the protective
surface liquids on their surfaces but the pathophysiology 0
disease reﬂects a common theme, i.e., too little protective
surface liquid and impaired mucus clearance. For example,
in xerostomia (dry mouth) the oral cavity is depleted o
liquid due to a failure of the parotid sublingual and sub-
mandibular glands to secrete liquid. Similarly, keratocon-
junctivitis sicca (dry eye) is caused insuﬂicient tear volume
resulting from the failure of lacrimal glands to secrete liquic
or excessive evaporative ﬂuid loss. In rhinosinusitis, there is
an imbalance, as in CB, between mucin secretion, relative
airway surface liquid depletion, and mucus stasis. Finally, in
the gastrointestinal tract, failure to secrete Cl— (and liquid)
in the proximal small intestine, combined with increase:
Na‘ (and liquid) absorption in the terminal ileum leads to the
distal intestinal obstruction syndrome (DIOS). In older
patients excessive Na+ (and volume) absorption in the
descending colon produces constipation and diverticulitis.
[0010] The high prevalence of both acute bronchitis anc
chronic bronchitis indicates that this disease syndrome is a
major health problem in the Us. Despite signiﬁcant
advancements in the etiology of mucus obstructive diseases,
pharmacotherapy of both CF and COPD have been charac-
terized by an aging array of therapies, typically including
inhaled steroids and bronchodilators for maintenance, anc
antibiotics and high-dose steroids for exacerbations. Clearly,
What are needed are drugs that are more effective at restoring
the clearance of mucus from the lungs of patients with
CB/CFi The value of these new therapies will be reﬂected in
improvements in the quality and duration of life for both the
CF and the CB populations.

[0011] One approach to increase mucus clearance is to
enhance the transportability of mucins via the disruption of
the polymeric mucus structure. Mucin proteins are orga-
nized into high molecular weight polymers via the formation
of covalent (disulﬁde) and non-covalent bonds Disruption
of the covalent bonds with reducing agents is a well-
established method to reduce the viscoelastic properties of
mucus in vitro and is predicted to minimize mucus adhe-
siveness and improve clearance in vivo. Reducing agents are
well known to decrease mucus viscosity in vitro and com-
monly used as an aid to processing sputum samples (Hirsch,
S. R., Zastrow, J. E., and Kory, R. C. Sputum liquefying
agents: a comparative in vitro evaluation, J, Lab. Clin. Med.
1969. 74:346-353). Examples of reducing agents include
sulﬁde containing molecules capable of reducing protein
di-sulﬂde bonds including, but not limited to, N-acetyl
cysteine, N-acystelyn, carbocysteine, cysteamine, gluta-
thione, and thioredoxin containing proteins.

NAC

[0012] N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) is approved for use in
conjunction with chest physiotherapy to loosen viscid or

Jan. 31, 2019

thickened airway mucus. Clinical studies evaluating the
effects of oral or inhaled NAC in CF and COPD have
reported improvements in the rheologic properties of mucus
and trends toward improvements in lung function and
decreases in pulmonary exacerbations (Duijvestijn YCM
and Brand PLPi; Systematic review of N-acetylcysteine in
cystic ﬁbrosis Acta Peadiatr 88: 38-41, 1999) However, the
preponderance of clinical data suggests that NAC is at best
a marginally effective therapeutic agent for treating airway
mucus obstruction when administered orally or as an inha-
lation aerosol. A recent Cochrane review of the existing
clinical literature on the use of NAC found no evidence to
support the eﬂicacy of NAC for CF (Nash E F, Stephenson
A, Ratjen F, Tullis E; Nebulized and oral thiol derivatives
for pulmonary disease in cystic ﬁbrosis. Cochrane Database
Syst Rev, 2009; 21(1):CD007168,).

[0013] NAC, as a topical pulmonary therapeutic agent, is
not optimal for the reduction of mucin disulﬁde bonds,
Speciﬁcally, NAC does not possess the basic properties of an
effective pulmonary drug as NAC (l) is a relatively ineﬂi-
cient reducing agent the airway surface environment (eg.
CF pH 6.5-7.2); and (2) is rapidly metabolized and cleared
from the airway surface (Jayaraman S, Song Y, Vetrivel L,
Shankar L, Verkman A S, Noninvasive in vivo ﬂuorescence
measurement of airway-surface liquid depth, salt concentra-
tion, and pH J Clin Invest. 2001; 107(3):3l7-24)i For
example. in the pH environment of the airway surface
(measured in the range of pH 6.0 to 7.2 in CF and COPD
airways), NAC exists only partially in its reactive state as a
negatively charge thiolate (Jayaraman S, Song Y, Vetrivel L,
Shankar L, Verkman A S, Noninvasive in vivo ﬂuorescence
measurement of airway-surface liquid depth, salt concentra-
tion, and pH. J Clin Invest. 2001; 107(3):317-24) (FIG. 3).
Furthermore, in animal studies, 14C-labeled NAC, adminis-
tered by inhalation, exhibits rapid elimination from the lungs
with a half-life of approximately 20 minutes (unpublished
observation). The relatively low reducing activity at of NAC
physiologic airway pH and the short half-life of NAC on the
lung surface provide an explanation for the lack of strong
clinical evidence for effective mucus reduction in mucus
obstructive diseases.

[0014] Additionally, NAC is most commonly adminis-
tered as a concentrated inhalation solution (Mucomyst® is a
20% or 1.27M solution). However, the administration of
concentrated NAC solutions inpact the tolerability of NAC
as it exaggerates (l) the unpleasant sulfur taste/odor, and (2)
pulmonary side effects including irritation and bronchocon-
striction which can require co-administration of rescue
medications such as bronchodilators. Although Muconiyst
was approved by the FDA in 1963, no other reducing agents
administered as an inhalation aerosol are currently available
to treat muco-obstructive diseases. What are needed are
effective, safe, and well-tolerated reducing agents for the
treatment of diseases characterized by impaired mucus
clearance.

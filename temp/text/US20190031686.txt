[0453] Recombinant His-tagged NAMPT was produced in
E. coli cells, puriﬁed over a Ni column, and further puriﬁed
over a size-exclusion column by XTAL Biostructures.
[0454] The NAM?" Enzymatic Reaction

[0455] The NAMPT enzymatic reactions were carried out
in Buﬁer A (50 mM Hepes pH 7.5, 50 mM NaCl, 5 mM
MgC12, and 1 mM TTP) in 96-well V—bottom plates, The
compound titrations were performed in a separate dilution
plate by serially diluting the compounds in DMSO to make
a 100x stocki ButferA(89 pL) containing 33 nM ofNAMPT
protein was added to 1 [LL of 100x compound plate con-
taining controls (eg. )MSO or blank). The compound and
enzyme mix was incu ated for 15 minutes at room tempera-
ture, then 10 [LL of 10x substrate and co-factors in Buffer A
were added to the test well to make a ﬁnal concentration of
1 [,IM NAM, 100 uM 5-Phospho-D-ribose 1-diphosphate
(PRPP), and 2.5 mM Adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP). The
reaction was allowec to proceed for 30 minutes at room
temperature, then was quenched with the addition of 11 [LL
of a solution of formic acid and L-Cystatllionine to make a
ﬁnal concentration 0 1% formic acid and 10 uM L-Cysta-
thionine, Backgrounc and signal strength was determined by
addition (or non-addition) of a serial dilution of NMN to a
pre-quenched enzyme and cofactor mix

[0456] Quantiﬁcation of NMN

[0457] A mass spectrometry-based assay was used to
measure the Nampt reaction product (NMN) and the internal
control (L-Cystathionine) NMN and L-Cystathionine were
detected using the services of Biocius Lifesciences with the
RapidF ire system. In short, the NMN and L-Cystathionine
are bound to a graphitic carbon cartridge in 0.1% formic
acid, eluted in 30% acetonitrile buffer, and injected into a
Sciex 4000 mass spectrometer. The components of the
sample were ionized with electrospray ionization and the
positive ions were detected. The Q] (parent ion) and Q3
(fragment ion) masses of NMN were 334.2 and 123.2,
respectively. The Q1 and Q3 for L-Cystathionine were 223.1
and 1341, respectively The fragments are quantiﬁed and the
analyzed by the following method

[0458] % lnhibitions are Determined Using this Method.
[0459] First the NMN signal is normalized to the L-Cys-
tathionine signal by dividing the NMN signal by the L-Cys-
tathionine signal for each well. The signal from the back-
ground wells are averaged and subtracted from the test
plates. The compound treated cells re then assayed for %
inhibition by using this formula,

IC50:10’(LOG 10(X)+(((50—% Inh at Cmpd Concen-
tuition thwart/Jame 10(X)7LOG10(Y))))

[0462] Wherein X denotes the compound concentration 1,
Y denotes the compound concentration 2, XX denotes the %
inhibition at compound concentration 1 (X), andYY denotes
the % inhibition at compound concentration 2 (Y) NAMPT
inhibiting compounds of this invention have 1C50 values
below In, more preferably below 0.1 uM and most prefer-
ably below 0.01 pM. Results for the compounds are pro-
vided in Table 3 below.

Assay Example 2

[0463] In-Vitro Cell Proliferation Assay

[0464] A2780 cells were seeded in 96-well plates at l><103
cells/well in 180 pL of culture medium (10% FBS, 1%
Pen/Strep Amphotecricin B, RPMI-1640) with and without
the addition of either B-nicotinamide mononucleotide
(NMN) or nicotinamide (NAM). After overnight incubation
at 37° C. and 5% C02, the compound titrations were
performed in a separate dilution plate by serially diluting the
compounds in DMSO to make a 1000>< stock. The com-
pounds were then further diluted to 10X ﬁnal concentration
in culture media, whereupon 20 uL of each dilution was
added to the plated cells with controls (eg. DMSO and
blank) to make a ﬁnal volume of 200 uL. The ﬁnal DMSO
concentration in each well was 0.1%. The plates were then
incubated for 72 hours at 37° C. in a 5% CO2 incubator, The
number of viable cells was then assessed using sulforhod-
amine B (SRB) assay. Cells were ﬁxed at 4° C. for 1 hour
with the addition of 50 uL 30% trichloroacetic acid (T CA)
to make a ﬁnal concentration of 6% TCA. The plates were
washed four times with H20 and allowed to dry for at least

Jan. 31, 2019

1 hour, whereupon 100 [LL of a 4% SRB in 1% acetic acid
solution was added to each well and incubated at room

temperature for at least 30 minutes. The plates were then
washed three times with 1% acetic acid, dried, and treated

with 100 uL of 10 mM Tris-Base solution. The plates were
then read in a microplate reader at an absorbance of 570 nm,
Background was generated on a separate plate with media
only.

[0465] Method for Determining % Inhibition

[0466] First, the signals from the background plate are
averaged, then the background was subtracted from the test
plates. The compound-treated cells were then assayed for %
inhibition by using the following formula:

% Iuh=100—100 *de

[0467] wherein x denotes the average signal of the com-
pound-treated cells and y denotes the average signal of the
DMSO-treated cells.

[0468] Formula for Determining 1C50 Values:

ICSO=10"(LOG 10(X)+(((50-% 11111 at Cmpd Concen-
nation 1)/(XX—YY)‘(LOG moo—LOG 10m)»

[0469] wherein X denotes the compound concentration 1,
Y denotes the compound concentration 2, XX denotes the %
inhibition at compound concentration 1 (X), andYY denotes
the % inhibition at compound concentration 2 (Y ).

[0470] Speciﬁcity of Cytotoxicity

[0471] Inhibition of NAMPT could be reversed by the
addition of NAM or NMN, The speciﬁcity of the compounds
were determined Via cell Viability assay in the presence of
the compound and either NAM or NMN, Percent inhibitions
were determined using the method given above.

[0472] NAMPT-inhibiting compounds of this invention
have 1C50-values below 1 uM, preferably below 0.1 HM and
most preferably below 0.0] uM. Results of for the com-
pounds are provided below in Table 3.

[0011] More recently, CHS-828 has been identiﬁed as a
NAMPT inhibitor (Olesen U H, et al. Anticancer agent
CHS-828 inhibits cellular synthesis of NAD, Biochem Bio-
phys Res Commun 2008; 367:799-804, [PubMed:
18201551]). CHS-828 has been shown that this compound
potently inhibits cell growth in a broad range of tumor cell
lines, although the detailed mechanism for this inhibitory
eﬁect of CHS-828 remains undetermined (Ravaud A, et a1,
Phase I study and guanidine kinetics of CHS-828, a guani-
dine-containing compound, administered orally as a single
dose every 3 weeks in solid tumors: an ECSG/EORTC study,
Eur J Cancer 2005; 41:702-707, [PubMed2 15763645]),
Both FK866 and CHS—828 are currently in clinical trials for
cancer treatments.

[0012] There are numerous uses for drugs which inhibit
NAMPT.

[0013] Lack of NAMPT expression strongly affects devel-
opment of both T and B lymphocytes By using mutant
forms of this protein and a well-characterized pharmaco-
logical inhibitor (FK866), authors demonstrated that the
ability of the NAMPT to regulate cell viability during
genotoxic stress requires its enzymatic activity Collectively,
these data demonstrate that NAMPT participates in cellular
resistance to genotoxic/oxidative stress, and it may confer to
cells of the immune system the ability to survive during
stressful situations such as inﬂammation (Rongvaux, A., et
al, The Jauma/ oflmmunology, 2008, 181: 4685-4695).
[0014] NAMPT may also have eﬁects on endothelium
(EC) in relation to high glucose levels, oxidative stress and
on aging, It is also believed that NAMPT may enable
proliferating human EC to resist the oxidative stress of aging
and of high glucose, and to productively use excess glucose
to support replicative longevity and angiogenic activity.

[0115] The compounds of the disclosed Formulas can
form salts which are also Within the scope of this invention,
Reference to a compound of the Formula herein is under-
stood to include reference to salts thereof, unless otherwise
indicated. The term “salt(s)”, as employed herein, denotes
acidic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic acids, as

well as basic salts formed with inorganic and/or organic
bases. In addition, when a compound of the Formulas
contain both a basic moiety, such as, but not limited to a
pyridine or imidazole, and an acidic moiety, such as, but not
limited to a carboxylic acid, zwitterions (“inner salts”) may
be formed and are included within the term “sa1t(s)” as used
herein. Pharmaceutically acceptable (i.e:, non-toxic, physi-
ologically acceptable) salts are preferred, although other
salts are also useful. Salts of the compounds of the Formulas
may be formed, for example, by reacting a compound of a
Formula with an amount of acid or base, such as an
equivalent amount, in a medium such as one in which the
salt precipitates or in an aqueous medium followed by
lyophilization Exemplary acid addition salts include
acetates, ascorbates, benzoates, benzenesulfonates, bisul-
fates, borates, butyrates, citrates, camphorates, camphorsul-
fonates, fumarates, hydrochlorides, hydrobromides,
hydroiodides, lactates, maleates, methanesulfonates, naph-
thalenesulfonates, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, propi-
onates, salicylates, succinates, sulfates, tartarates, thiocya-
nates, toluenesulfonates (also known as tosylates,) and the
like. Additionally, acids which are generally considered
suitable for the formation of pharrnaceutically useful salts
from basic pharmaceutical compounds are discussed, for
example. by R Stahl et a1, Camille G: (eds) Handbook of
Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection and Use. (2002)
Zurich: Wiley-VCH; S. Berge et al, Journal of Pharmaceu-
tical Sciences (1977) 66(1) 1-19; F. Gould, International J.
of Pharmaceutics (1986) 33 201-217; Anderson et al, The
Practice of Medicinal Chemistry (1996), Academic Press,
New York; and in The Orange Book (Food & Drug Admin-
istration, Washington, DC. on their website). These disclo-
sures are incorporated herein by reference thereto.

[0116] Exemplary basic salts include ammonium salts,
alkali metal salts such as sodium, lithium, and potassium
salts, alkaline earth metal salts such as calcium and magne-
sium salts, salts with organic bases (for example, organic
amines) such as dicyclohexylamines, t-butyl amines, and
salts with amino acids such as arginine, lysine and the like.
Basic nitrogen-containing groups may be quartemized with
agents such as lower alkyl halides (e.g, methyl, ethyl, and
butyl chlorides, bromides and iodides), dialkyl sulfates (e.g.
dimethyl, diethyl, and dibutyl sulfates), long chain halides
(e:g. decyl, lauryl, and stearyl chlorides, bromides and
iodides), aralkyl halides (eg. benzyl and phenethyl bro-
mides), and others.

[0117] All such acid salts and base salts are intended to be
pharmaceutically acceptable salts within the scope of the
invention and all acid and base salts are considered equiva-
lent to the free forms of the corresponding compounds for
purposes of the invention.

[0118] Pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the com-
pounds of the invention are also considered to be part of the
invention. Pharmaceutically acceptable esters of the present
compounds include the following groups: (1) carboxylic
acid esters obtained by esteriﬁcation of the hydroxy groups,
in which the non-carbonyl moiety of the carboxylic acid
portion of the ester grouping is selected from straight or
branched chain alkyl (for example, acetyl, n-propyl, t-butyl,
or n-butyl), alkoxyalkyl (for example, methoxymethyl),
aralkyl (for example, benzyl), aryloxyalkyl (for example,
phenoxymethyl), aryl (for example, phenyl optionally sub-
stituted with, for example, halogen, C 1,4alkyl, or CHalkoxy
or amino), (2) sulfonate esters, such as alkyl- or aralkylsul-

PRIORITY CLAIM

[0001] This application claims priority from US, provi-
sional application 61/483,937 ﬁled on May 9, 2011 and US,

FIELD OF THE INVENTION

[0002] The present invention relates to compounds and
composition for inhibition of Nicotinamide phosphoribosyl-
transferase (“NAMPT”), their synthesis, applications and
antidote.

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) plays
fundamental roles in both cellular energy metabolism and
cellular signaling, In energy metabolism, the chemistry of
the pyridine ring allows NAD to readily accept and donate
electrons in hydride transfer reactions catalyzed by numer-
ous dchydrogenascs.

[0004] The preparation of a class of compounds, compris-
ing several subclasses, which act as inhibitors of the forma-
tion of nicotinamide adenyl nucleotide, and their use thereof
as anti-tumour agents, is already described in the patent
applications WOOD/50399, WOW/48695, WOW/48696,
WOW/48397, W099/31063, W099/31060, W099/31087,
W099/31064, W000/50399, and W003/80054.

[0005] One of these inhibitors, (E)-N-[4-(l -benzoy1piperi-
din-4-yl)butyl]-3-(pyridine—3-yl)-acrylamide also known as
AP0866, FK866, WK175, or WK22.175 and hereinafter
referred to as FK866 [International Non-proprietary Name],
is especially described in the literature as an anticancer
agent, FK866 may be used for treatment of diseases impli-
cating deregulated apoptosis such as cancer. It has been
demonstrated in the prior art that FK866 interferes with
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (also known and herein-
after referred to as NAD) biosynthesis and induces apoptotic
cell death without any DNA damaging effects.

[0006] Additionally, FK866 ((E)-N-[4-(l-benzoylpiperi-
din-4-yl) butyl]-3-(pyridin-3-yl) acrylamide) induces apop-
tosis in HepG2 cells without having primary effects on
cellular energy metabolism, (Hasmann M, Schemainda I,
FK866, a Highly Speciﬁc Noncompetitive Inhibitor ofNico-
tinamide Phosphoribosyltransferase, Represents a Novel
Mechanism for Induction of Tumor Cell Apoptosis, Cancer
Res 2003; 63:7436-7442, [PubMed: 14612543]). Instead of
causing immediate cytotoxicity, it inhibits NAMPT and
depletes the cells of NAD, suggesting that FK866 could be
a promising agent against cancer cells that rely on nicoti-
namide to synthesize NAD. The crystal structure of the
NAMPT-FK866 complex reveals that the compound binds
at the nicotinamide-binding site of NAMPT to inhibit its
activity, FK866 has been tested in a murine renal cell
carcinoma model and shown to display anti-tumor, antimeta-
static, and anti-angiogenic activities (Drevs .I, et al, Antian-
giogenic potency of FK866/K22i175, a new inhibitor of
intracellular NAD biosynthesis, in murine renal cell carci-
noma. Anticancer Res 2003; 23:4853-4858. [PubMed:
14981935D.

Jan. 31, 2019

[0007] In a mouse mammary carcinoma model, FK866
also induces a delay in tumor growth and an enhancement in
tumor radiosensitivity accompanied with dose-dependent
decreases in NAD levels, pH, and energy status, A chemo-
sensitizing effect of FK866 has also been observed on
anti-neoplastic l -methyl-3-nitro-1-nitrosoguanidinium
(MNNG)-induced cell death in THP-l and K562 leukemia
cell lines (Pogrebniak A, et al. Chemopotentiating effects of
a novel NAD biosynthesis inhibitor, FK866, in combination
with antineoplastic agents, Eur J Med Res 2006; 11:313-321.
[PubMed: 17052966]),

[0008] The eﬂicacy of GMX1777 was evaluated in xeno-
graﬁ models and the pharmacokinetic proﬁle of GMX1778
and its effect on nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide cellular

levels was measured by liquid chromatography/mass spec-
trometry. (Beauparlant P, et al. Preclinical development of
the nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase inhibitor prod-
rug GMXI771 Anticancer Drugs. 2009 June. 20(5):346-
54).

[0009] GMX1777 is a water-soluble intravenously admin-
istered prodrug of GMXI 778 that Gemin X in-licensed from

inhibitor olomucine has been found to act synergistically
with known cytotoxic agents in inducing apoptosis (J . Cell
Sci., (1995) 108, 2897). The compounds of the invention
may also be administered sequentially with known antican-
cer or cytotoxic agents when a combination formulation is
inappropriate. In any combination treatment, the invention is
not limited in the sequence of administration; compounds of
Formula (I) may be administered either prior to or after
administration of the known anticancer or cytotoxic agent.
For example, the cytotoxic activity of the cyclin-dependent
kinase inhibitor ﬂavopiridol is affected by the sequence of
administration with anticancer agents. Cancer Research,

convening (e.g., hydrolyzing) the individual diastereomers
to the corresponding pure enantiomers. Also, some of the
compounds of the various Formulas may be atropisomers
(e.g,, substituted biaryls) and are considered as part of this
invention, Enantiomers can also be separated by use of
chiral HPLC column.

[0128] It is also possible that the compounds of the various
Formulas may exist in different tautomeric forms, and all
such forms are embraced within the scope of the invention
Also, for example, all keto—enol and imine-enarnine forms of
the compounds are included in the invention.

[0129] All stereoisomers (for example, geometric isomers,
optical isomers and the like) of the present compounds
(including those of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs of
the compounds as well as the salts, solvates and esters of the
prodrugs), such as those which may exist due to asymmetric
carbons on various substituents, including enantiomeric
forms (which may exist even in the absence of asymmetric
carbons), rotameric forms, atropisomers, and diastereomeric
forms, are contemplated within the scope of this invention,
as are positional isomers (such as, for example, 4-pyridyl
and 3-pyridyl). (For example, if a compound of the various
Formulas incorporates a double bond or a fused ring, both
the cis- and trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced
within the scope of the invention. Also, for example, all
keto-enol and imine-enamine forms of the compounds are
included in the invention.) Individual stereoisomers of the
compounds of the invention may, for example, be substan-
tially free of other isomers, or may be admixed, for example,
as racemates or with all other. or other selected. stereoiso-
mers. The chiral centers of the present invention can have
the S or R conﬁguration as deﬁned by the IUPAC 1974
Recommendations. The use of the temis “salt”, “solvate”,
“ester”, “prodrug” and the like, is intended to equally apply
to the salt, solvate, ester and prodrug of enantiomers, ste-
reoisomers, rotamers, tautomers, positional isomers, race-
mates or prodnigs of the inventive compounds,

[0130] The present invention also embraces isotopically-
labelled compounds of the present invention which are
identical to those recited herein, but for the fact that one or
more atoms are replaced by an atom having an atomic mass
or mass number diiferent from the atomic mass or mass
number usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that
can be incorporated into compounds of the invention include
isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus,
ﬂuorine and chlorine, such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 18O,
17O, 31F, 32l), 35S, 18F, and 36Cl, respectively,

[0131] Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of the
various Formulas (e.g., those labeled with 3 H and 14C) are
useful in compound and/or substrate tissue distribution
assays, Tritiated (i.e., 3H) and carbon-l4 (i.e,. 14C) isotopes
are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and
detectability, Further, substitution with heavier isotopes such
as deuterium (i.e,, 2H) may aﬁord certain therapeutic advan-
tages resulting from greater metabolic stability (e.g.,
increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements)
and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. Isoto-
pically labelled compounds of the various Formulas can
generally be prepared by following procedures analogous to
those disclosed in the Schemes and/or in the Examples
hereinbelow, by substituting an appropriate isotopically
labelled reagent for a non-isotopically labelled reagent,

[0132] Polymorphic forms of the compounds of the vari-
ous Formulas, and of the salts, solvates, esters and prodrugs

fonyl (for example, methanesulfonyl); (3) amino acid esters
(for example, L-valyl or L-isoleucyl); (4) pho sphonate esters
and (5) mono-, di- or triphosphate esters. The phosphate
esters may be further esterifled by, for example, a C1,20
alcohol or reactive derivative thereof, or by a 2,3-di(C6_24)
acyl glycerol.

[0119] Prodrugs and solvates of the compounds of the
invention are also contemplated herein A discussion of
prodrugs is rovided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs
as Novel Delivery Systems (1987) 14 of the A.C.S. Sym-
posium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design,
(1987) Edward B. Roche, ed, American Pharmaceutical
Association and Pergamon Press. The term “prodrug” means
a compounc (eg, a drug precursor) that is transformed in
vivo to yield a compound of the instant Formulas or a
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate of the
compound, The transformation may occur by various
mechanisms (e.g., by metabolic or chemical processes), such
as, for exam le, through hydrolysis in blood. A discussion of
the use of prodrugs is provided by T. Iliguchi and W. Stella,
“Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems,” Vol. 14 of the
A.C.S. Sym osium Series, and in Bioreversible Carriers in
Drug Design, ed, Edward B. Roche, American Pharmaceu-
tical Association and Pergamon Press, 1987.

[0120] For example, if a compound of the instant Formu-
las or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt, hydrate or solvate
of the com ound contains a carboxylic acid functional
group, a prodrug can comprise an ester formed by the
replacement of the hydrogen atom of the acid group with a
group such as, for example, (C1-C8)alkyl, (CZ-C 12)alkanoy-
loxymethyl, 1-(alkanoyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to 9 carbon
atoms, 1-methyl-1-(alkanoyloxy)-ethyl having from 5 to 10
carbon atoms, alkoxycarbonyloxymethyl having from 3 to 6
carbon atoms, 1-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl having from 4 to
7 carbon atoms, l-methyl-l-(alkoxycarbonyloxy)ethyl hav-
ing from 5 to 8 carbon atoms, N-(alkoxycarbonyl)aminom-
ethyl having from 3 to 9 carbon atoms, l-(N-(alkoxycarbo-
nyl)amino)ethyl having from 4 to 10 carbon atoms,
3-phthalidyl, 4-crotonolactonyl, gamma-butyrolacton—4-yl,
di-N,N~(C1-C2)alkylamino(C2-C3)alkyl (such as [3-dim-
ethylaminoethyl), carbamoyl-(Cl-C2)alkyl, N,N-di(C1-C2)
alkylcarbanioyl-(C1-C2)alkyl and piperidino-, pyrrolidino-
or morpholino(C2-C3)alkyl, and the like,

[0121] Similarly, if a compound of the instant Formulas
contains an alcohol functional group, a prodrug can be
formed by the replacement of the hydrogen atom of the
alcohol group with a group such as, for example, (C1-C6)
alkanoyloxymethyl, 1-((C1-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl,
1 -methyl- 1 -((C1-C6)alkanoyloxy)ethyl, (C 1 -C5)alkoxycar-
bonyloxymethyl, N7(Cl-C6)alkoxycarbonylaminomethyl,
succinoyl, (C1-C6)alkanoyl, ot-amino(C1-C4)alkanyl, ary-
lacyl and ot-aminoacyl, or (x-aminoacyl-(x-aminoacyl, where
each a-aminoacyl group is independently selected from the
naturally occurring L-amino acids, P(O)(OH)2, 7P(O)(O
(C1-C6)alkyl)2 or glycosyl (the radical resulting from the
removal of a hydroxyl group of the hemiacetal form of a
carbohydrate), and the like.

[0122] If a compound of the instant Formulas incorporates
an amine functional group, a prodrug can be formed by the
replacement of a hydrogen atom in the amine group with a
group such as, for example, R-carbonyl, RO-carbonyl,
NRR‘-carbonyl where R and R‘ are each independently
(C 1-Cm)alkyl, (C3-C7) cycloalkyl, benzyl, or R-carbonyl is
a natural a-aminoacyl or natural u-aminoacyl, 4C(OH)C

(O)OY1 wherein Y1 is H, (C1-C6)alkyl or benzyl, 7C(OY2)
Y3 wherein Y2 is (C 1-C4) alkyl and Y3 is (C 1-C6)alkyl,
carboxy(C1-C6)alkyl, amino(C1-C4)alkyl or mono-Ni or
di-N,N7(C1-C6)alkylaminoalkyl, 4C(Y4)Y5 whereinY4 is
H or methyl and Y5 is mono-Ni or di-N,N7(C 1-C5)
alkylarnino morpholino, piperidin-l-yl or pyrrolidin-l-yl,
and the like.

[0123] One or more compounds of the invention may exist
in unsolvated as well as solvated forms with pharmaceuti-
cally acceptable solvents such as water, ethanol, and the like,
and it is intended that the invention embrace both solvated
and unsolvated forms. “Solvate” means a physical associa-
tion of a compound of this invention with one or more
solvent molecules. This physical association involves vary-
ing degrees of ionic and covalent bonding, including hydro-
gen bonding. In certain instances the solvate will be capable
of isolation, for example when one or more solvent mol-
ecules are incorporated in the crystal lattice of the crystalline
solid. “Solvate” encompasses both solution-phase and iso-
latable solvates, Non-limiting examples of suitable solvates
include ethanolates, methanolates, and the like “Hydrate” is
a solvate wherein the solvent molecule is H20.

[0124] One or more compounds of the invention may
optionally be converted to a solvate. Preparation of solvates
is generally known Thus, for example, M. Caira et al, .1.
Pharmaceutical Sci., 93(3), 601-611 (2004) describe the
preparation of the solvates of the antifungal ﬂuconazole in
ethyl acetate as well as from water, Similar preparations of
solvates, hemisolvate, hydrates and the like are described by
E. C. van Tonder et a1, AAPS PharmSciTech., 5(1), article 12
(2004); and A. L. Bingham et al, Chemi Commun, 603-604
(2001). A typical, non-limiting, process involves dissolving
the inventive compound in desired amounts of the desired
solvent (organic or water or mixtures thereof) at a higher
than ambient temperature, and cooling the solution at a rate
suﬁicient to form crystals which are then isolated by stan-
dard methods. Analytical techniques such as, for example I,
R. spectroscopy, show the presence of the solvent (or water)
in the crystals as a solvate (or hydrate).

[0125] Compounds of the various Formulas, and salts,
solvates, esters and prodr'ugs thereof, may exist in their
tautomeric form (for example, as an amide or imino ether).
All such tautomeric forms are contemplated herein as part of
the present invention.

[0126] The compounds of the various Formulas may con-
tain asymmetric or chiral centers, and, therefore, exist in
different stereoisomeric forms. It is intended that all stereoi-
someric forms of the compounds of the various Formulas as
well as mixtures thereof, including racemic mixtures, form
part of the present invention. In addition, the present inven-
tion embraces all geometric and positional isomers. For
example, if a compound of the various Formulas incorpo-
rates a double bond or a fused ring, both the cis- and
trans-forms, as well as mixtures, are embraced within the
scope of the invention.

[0127] Diastercomeric mixtures can be separated into their
individual diastereomers on the basis of their physical
chemical differences by methods well known to those skilled
in the art, such as, for example, by chromatography and/or
fractional crystallization Enantiomers can be separated by
converting the enantiomeric mixture into a diastereomeric
mixture by reaction with an appropriate optically active
compound (e.g., chiral auxiliary such as a chiral alcohol or
Mosher’s acid chloride), separating the diastereomers and

[0103] Numerical ranges, as used herein, are intended to
include sequential whole numbers. For example, a range
expressed as “from 0 to 4” would include 0, l, 2, 3 and 4.
[0104] As used herein, the term “substituted” means that
the speciﬁed group or moiety bears one or more suitable
substituents.

[0105] As used herein, the term “unsubstituted” means
that the speciﬁed group bears no substituents.

[0106] As used herein, the term “optionally substituted”
means that the speciﬁed group is unsubstituted or substituted
by one or more substituents,

[0107] When a multifunctional moiety is shown, the point
of attachment to the core is indicated by a line, For e.g,
(cycloalkyloxy)alkyl- refers to alkyl being the point of
attachment to the core while cycloalkyl is attached to alkyl
via the oxy group

[0108] The expression “adjunctive chemotherapeutic
agen ” generally refers to agents which treat, alleviate,
relieve, or ameliorate the side eﬁects of chemotherapeutic
agents. Such agents include those which modify blood cell
growth and maturation. Examples of adjunctive chemothera-
peutic agents include, but are not limited to, ﬁlgrastim and
erythropoietin. Other such adjunctive chemotherapeutic
agents include those which inhibit nausea associated with
administration of the chemotherapeutic agents, such as a
5-HT3 receptor inhibitor (eg, dolansetron, granisetron, or
ondansetron), with or without dexamethasone.

[0109] The terms “chemotherapeutic agent” and “amine-
oplastic agent” generally refer to agents which treat, prevent,
cure, heal, alleviate, relieve, alter, remedy, ameliorate,
improve, or affect malignancies and their metastasis.

[0378] STEP A: To a solution of ten-butyl 4-(pyrrolidin-
3-yl)butylcarbamate (0.993 g, 4.10 mmol) and triethylamine
(1.343 mL, 9.64 mmol) in DCM (50 mL) at 0° C. was added
dropwise benzoyl chloride (0476 mL, 4.10 mmol), The
reaction was allowed to warm slowly to ambient tempera-
ture over 16 h. The mixture was diluted with water and DCM
and the layers separated, The organic layer was washed
successively with saturated aqueous NaHCO3 and brine, and
dried over MgSOA. The residue was puriﬁed by Biotage
(EtOAc/hexane gradient) to alford tert-butyl (4—(1-benzo-
ylpyrrolidin-3-yl)butyl)carbamate (474 mg, 33%) as a col-
orless oil.

[0379] STEP B: To a solution of tert-butyl 4—(1-benzo-
ylpyrrolidin-3-y1)buty1carbamate (474 mg, 1.368 mmol) in
DCM (10 mL) was added TFA (10 mL), The mixture was
stirred at ambient temperature for 16 h, and then was
concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was
ciluted with methylene chloride and washed successively
with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate and saturated
aqueous sodium chloride. The organic layer was separated,
cried with MgSO4, ﬁltered, and concentrated under reduced
pressure to aﬁord (3-(4-aminobuty1)pyrrolidir1-l -yl)(phenyl)
methanone (64 mg, 19%).

[0380] STEP C: To a mixture of (3-(4-aminobutyl)pyrro-
idin-l-yl)(pheny1)methanone (64 mg, 0.260 mmol),
H-pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyrldir1e-2-carboxylic acid (421 mg,
0.260 mmol) and HATU (148 mg, 0.390 mmol) in DMF (5
mL) was added DIEA (0.100 mL, 0.572 mmol). The mixture
was stirred for 16 hours at ambient temperature and was then
concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was
ciluted with ethyl acetate and washed with aqeuous 1N
NaOH (2X) and dried (MgSO4), The crude mixture was
puriﬁed by Biotage (DCM/MeOH gradient) to afford N-(4-
1-benzoylpyrrolidin-3-y1)buty1)-1H-pyrrolo[3,2-c]pyri-
cine-2-carboxamide as a white solid (75 mg, 74%).

with a small amount of impurities. Run through Biotage
again to give 215.9 mg of product which was clean except
for some DIEA salts. Diluted material in 10% MeOH/
CHZCI2 and washed with aq. sodium bicarbonate. Material
formed emulsion. Drained methylene chloride and then
added EtOAc. Emulsion again. Managed to separate organic
layers and then combined and concentrated to give 159.6 mg
of clean product (37% yield)

CLEANING COMPOSITION

[0001] The present invention relates to a liquid cleaning
composition having a wide spectrum of activity against
harmful organisms and microorganisms, including viruses.
More particularly but not exclusively, it relates to such a
composition for cleansing hard surfaces, including wares,
medical implements, medical devices and surgical and den-
tal instruments, and for cleansing soﬁ surfaces, such as
furnishing, carpeting and textiles,

[0002] There is increasing concern about the incidence of
serious infections that are picked up in hospitals and other
medical environments, both by patients and by stafE It is
believed that a signiﬁcant vector for such infections is
imperfectly disinfected surfaces harbouring bacteria and/or
viruses that are or have become resistant to existing surface
cleaning agents and conventional topical disinfectants

[0003] Bacteria such as MRSA (methicillin-resistant
Staphylococcus aureus) and C. diff (Clostridium diﬁcile)
have become notorious for surviving routine cleaning
regimes and lingering to infect further victims. In 2006,
almost 6500 deaths in the UK were reported as being due to
C. diff infection, an increase of around 69% on 2005. Since
such bacteria and their spores are resistant to most antibi-
otics once they have entered the body, it is important that
bacterial/sporal contamination of an area (or of a medical
device, implement, etc) from an infected patient be eradi-
cated before cross-infection can occur.

[0004] Mycobacteria, such as the bacterium causing tuber-
culosis, are also becoming a serious concem once more,
Tuberculosis infection rates in the UK rose by about 11% in
2007, Again, resistant strains are suspected

[0005] Viral infections, such as inﬂuenza (most notori-
ously “bird ﬂu”, avian inﬂuenza virus strain HSNl) and
SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) are also believed
to be at least in part linked to residual viral contamination of
surfaces which have been incompletely cleaned and disin-
fected.

[0006] A further issue that frequently needs to be
addressed is the removal from surfaces of mould, yeast or
fungal contamination and other microﬂora/microfaunai

[0007] Additionally, while some progress has been made
towards dealing with contamination by active bacteria,
fungi, and the like, active spore cells are usually signiﬁ-
cantly tougher and more resistant to existing cleansing and
disinfection methods and media, It would be particularly
beneﬁcial if a composition suitable for removal of bacteria,
viruses and/or fungal contamination could also be made
effective against spores, since spores may well be respon-
sible for long-term re-infection, even aﬁer other microor-
ganisms, including vegetative bacterial forms, have been
scoured away.

[0008] While it is possible for media for cleansing hard
surfaces, medical devices, surgical instruments and the like
to be more aggressive than those used on a patient’s person,
one must still ensure that the cleansing medium does not
damage the surface, device, etc, being cleaned. This has in
the past prevented the use of compositions that might
otherwise have been hygienically effective. Aerospace mate-
rials, such as aluminium alloys, require particular care to
avoid corrosion. Media for cleaning and disinfecting soft
surfaces (erg. upholstery, carpeting, bedding and clothing)
must also avoid damaging the material being cleaned;
bleaching of textiles or carpets can be an issue, for example.

Jan. 3], 2019

[0009] One further issue that must nowadays be consid-
ered is the long-tenn effect of cleaning compositions on the
environment. Commonly used sequestering agents such as
EDTA (ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid) and NTA (nitrilo-
triacetic acid) are effective against dissolved calcium ions
and other such species that might inhibit cleansing effects.
However, they tend to pass unhindered through conventional
sewage treatment and are not readily biodegradable. Resi-
dues from wash waters may contaminate watercourses or the
like, and there is concern about their long-tenn environmen-
tal effects. It would therefore be beneﬁcial if a cleaning
composition were highly effective in the short term, but
subsequently broke down readily in the environment,
[0010] It is hence an object of the present invention to
provide a cleaning composition for hard surfaces, medical
devices and instruments, surgical implements or the like
which has bactericidal, virucidal, fungicidal and sporicidal
properties, while obviating the above disadvantages of exist-
ing compositions. It is ﬁrrther an object of the present
invention to provide such a composition that may be used on
soft surfaces, such as textiles, carpeting or the like.

[0011] According to a ﬁrst aspect of the present invention,
there is provided an aqueous surface cleaning and disinfect-
ing composition comprising a long-chain alkyl polyamine
compound, a long-chain quaternary ammonium salt, and a
metal carbonate salt, wherein the composition has a pH in
use of at least 11.

[0012] Preferably, said long-chain alkyl polyamine com-
pound comprises a long-chain alkyl triamine compound.
[0013] Advantageously, said long-chain alkyl polyamine
compound comprises a compound having the general for-
mula R17N((CHZ)mNHZ)(CHZLNHZ, where R1 is a linear
or branched alkyl chain comprising at least eight carbon
atoms, and each of m and n equals 2, 3 or 4,

[0014] The long-chain alkyl polyamine compound may
have the general formula R17N((CH2),,,NHZ)Z, i.e, m
equals 11,

[0015] Optionally, each of m and n equals three.

[0016] The R1 moiety may comprise a linear or branched
alkyl chain having between ten and sixteen carbon atoms,
optionally twelve.

[0056] Said soft material may comprise clothing.

[0057] The method may comprise a laundering method, in
which case the composition may be applied in a rinsing/
conditioning step.

[0058] An embodiment of the present invention will now
be more particularly described by way of example.

[0059] A ﬁrst cleansing composition concentrate was
made up, containing the following components per 100
kilograms (% w/w):

Water 54.075 kg
Dodecyl dipropylene triamine 12.0 kg
Tetrasodium N,Nrbis(carboxylatomediyl)rLrglutamate 7.2 kg
N.Nrdldecyer,Nrdimethylammonium chloride 8.7 kg
cm/c”3 fatty alcohol polyglycol enter 5.0 kg
Potassium carbonate 5.0 kg
Monoethanolamine 8.0 kg
Benzotiiazole 0.025 kg

[0060] The composition appeared as a clear colourless
liquid with a pH of 12.6.

[0061] Dodecyl dipropylene triamine is a biocidally active
material. Tetrasodium N,N—bis(carboxylatomethyl)—L-gluta-
mate is a sequestering agent used to soften water by com-
plexing calcium ions. It is believed to be readily biodegrad-
able, possibly due to its glutamate skeleton, unlike
conventional sequestering agents such as EDTA (ethylene
diamine tetra-acetic acid). N,N-didecyl-N,N-dimethylam-
monium chloride is a quaternary ammonium salt (or “quat”)
with detergent and disinfectant properties. Fatty acid
polyglycol ethers are used as wetting agents and dispersants.
Monoethanolamine is used as a buffering agent and also has
wetting properties. Benzotriazole is a preservative which
also has some anti-corrosive properties:

[0062] The above concentrate is used diluted with water to
10% of the above concentrations, at which point it has a pH
of around 11.7, or even diluted a hundredfold to 1% w/w, at
which point it has a pH of around 11.2.

[0063] At these working concentrations, the above com-
position is found not to be hazardous to human health. Tests
have also shown that the composition is biodegradable in the
short to medium term. Conventional compositions (which
usually contain sequestering agents such as EDTA or NTA)
may require speciﬁc labelling, as well as speciﬁc precau-
tions to avoid them being washed into watercourses or the
like: However, the above composition is found not to be
persistent in the environment and it is believed that no such
labelling will be required. (Good housekeeping principles
would still discourage discharge into watercourses, but any
unplanned releases would be unlikely to cause signiﬁcant
problems).

[0064] Testing on cleansing hard surfaces (including
medical and surgical devices and instruments) and soft
surfaces (including textiles and soft furnishing materials)
contaminated with bacteria, viruses, fungi and even spores
has shown a wide spectrum of eﬂicacy.

[0065] Testing has been carried out against each of the
following EN (European Norm) standardised tests for clean-
ing and disinfection:
US 2019/0031980 A1

EN1275 (applicable for fungi and yeasts);
EN1650 (applicable for fungi and yeasts);
EN1276 (applicable for bacteria, tungi, yeast and spores);
EN13727 (applicable for bacteria in the presence of blood);
EN13697 (applicable for bacteria and ﬁingi - this test is carried out
on actual samples of surfaces to be cleaned, rather
than in the test-tube);
EN14347 (applicable for spores - this is a particularly severe test
as the spores are aged for four weeks before
application of the test disinfecting medium, and are
hence much tougher than those encountered in real
life conditions);
EN14348 (applicable for TB, a mycobactenum);
EN14476 (applicable against viruses , test must include polio virus,
the hardest RNA virus to destroy outside the body, and adeno
virus, the hardest DNA virus to destroy outside the body); and
EN13704 (applicable for spores).
[0066] All these tests were passed with ease. Speciﬁcally:
EN1275: passed in 1 minute.
EN1650: passed in 1 minute.
EN1276: passed in 1 minute.
EN13727: passed in 1 minute.
EN13697: bacteria: passed in 5 minutes
fungi/yeast: passed in 15 minutes.
EN14347: passed in 1 minute, even with fully aged spores.
EN14348: passed in 1 minute, test requirement is 60 minutes.
EN14476: passed with a log 5 (100,000 fold) reduction in 5 minutes;

test requirement is a log 4 (10,000 fold) reduction in
60 minutes.
EN13704: passed in 2 minutes; test requirement is 60 minutes.

[0067] The individual components of the composition
have been found not to have sporicidal eﬁects, but the
combination of the long-chain triamine and the quaternary
ammonium salt, at the pH ranges used, appears to be
suﬂicient to penetrate the tough outer layer of spores and kill
them. Existing cleansing media have only had signiﬁcant
effect once spores have become vegetative bacteria, poten-
tially leaving unharmed spores as a long-term reservoir of
contamination

[0068] The composition is also effective against so-called
“naked” viruses, which are particularly resistant to existing
disinfecting media. Examples of such viruses are polio,
adeno, norovirus and canine parvovirus.

[0069] The dodecyl dipropylene triamine biocide used in
the above composition has no effect on its own when tested
against the polio virus. In the standard test, the above
composition passes within ﬁve minutes, against a require-
ment allowing sixty minutes, indicating high effectiveness
under realistic conditions of user

[0070] A further beneﬁt of the above composition over
existing cleansing and disinfecting media is that it is not
inactivated by organic soiling. Most or all existing media are
substantially inactivated by the presence of blood, making it
diﬁicult to clean surgical instruments effectively, for
example. Both quaternary ammonium salts and alkyl tri-
amines suffer from this problem, when used on their own.
Under the standard test EN13727:2003 “Chemical disinfec-
tants and antiseptics. Qualitative suspension test for the
evaluation ofbacteriocidal activity of chemical disinfectants
for instruments used in the medical area”, the above com-
position is still fully effective in the presence of blood,
achieving a pass score in only one minute.

[0071] Each of the above standard EN tests (except for
EN14476) has been performed in both “clean” and “dirty”

Jan. 31, 2019

conditions. “Dirty” conditions are simulated by the addition
of a 10% albumen loading. Nevertheless, the above com-
position passed the tests easily, even in “dirty” conditions.

[0072] It is important that a widely-usable cleanser and
disinfectant should not attack the surfaces to which it is
applied, including surfaces of medical devices and instru-
ments, such as endoscopes and ﬂexible endoscopes, surgical
instruments and dental instruments This has previously
limited the use of cleansing media having particularly high
(or low) pH values. However, when the above composition
is tested under ASTM G 31-7222004 “Standard Practice for
Laboratory Immersion Corrosion Testing of Metals”, it is
found to be effectively non-corrosive. Even though a small
level of benzotriazole anti-corrosive is present, in the com-
position, and monoethanolamine is known to have some
anti-corrosive effect, this is a surprisingly signiﬁcant eﬂfect.
The above composition is hence not considered corrosive to
metals under current EU directives, even though the con-
centrate reaches a pH of around 126 and even at 1% w/w
dilution, it has a pH of 112.

[0073] It is also important that a cleanser/disinfectant for
use on soﬁ surfaces, such as upholstery, curtains, carpeting,
bedding, clothing and the like, should not harm the surfaces
to be cleaned. (For example, bleach can be an elfective
disinfectant, but will attack many ﬁbres in textiles or car-
peting, and bleach out dyestuffs). No such problems have
been experienced with compositions embodying the present
invention.

[0074] Compositions of the present invention also appear
to be effective against contamination in laundry applica-
tions. The standard reconunendation from the UK Depart-
ment of Health and the World Health Organisation is that
hospital clothing, bedding and the like should be washed at
a temperature of 80° C. or greater, to ensure complete
cleaning and disinfection. These temperatures, effectively a
“boil wash”, are likely to damage the textiles involved,
shortening their lifetimes and making them uncomfomible in
wear. The additional energy costs of washing at over 80“ C.
are also very signiﬁcant, particularly as modern detergents
can often clean (but not disinfect) at 30° C. to 40° C.

[0075] However, the above composition has been tested in
the following wash cycle: wash with detergent convention-
ally at 30° C.-40° C.; rinse with water; rinse with a diluted
form of the above composition; rinse again with water. This
has given the same effectiveness in cleaning and disinfection
as an 80° C. wash with detergent and water rinse alone.
There would hence be major savings in both energy costs
and the lifetime of the textiles being cleaned. Since the
above composition is effectively biodegradable, the envi-
ronmental concerns that might attend the use of existing
cleansing/disinfecting media should not arise.

[0076] It hence appears that the cleansing and disinfecting
composition of the present invention has unexpectedly broad
and rapid effectiveness against all pathogens of particular
current interest, Without the drawbacks and side effects that
might have been predicted.

METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS FOR
SUPPRESSING RETROVIRUSES

CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED
APPLICATION

[0001] This application claims priority to US. Provisional
Application No. 62/260,559, ﬁled Nov. 29, 2015, the con-
tents of which are incorporated herein by reference.

FIELD

[0002] The disclosure relates to the ﬁeld of gene therapy
for treatment and control of retroviral infections, for
example HIV infection, and provides methods and compo-
sitions therefor.

BACKGROUND

[0003] The Retroviridae are a family of viruses that insert
a DNA copy of their genome into the genome of the host cell
in order to replicate. A retroviral genome is made up of two
single strands of plus-sense RNA. In the retrovirus, the RNA
is bound to a capsid protein and encased, along with
enzymes necessary for replication, within an envelope made
of a retroviral envelope protein in association with glyco-
proteins and lipids from the membrane of the host cell. The
envelope facilitates recognition of the potential host cell and
entry into the host cell. Once inside the host cell cytoplasm,
the retrovinxs releases a reverse transcriptase enzyme to
produce DNA from the retroviral RNA genome, which DNA
is then incorporated into the host cell genome by a retroviral
integrase. The retroviral DNA that is integrated into the host
cell genome is called a provirus. The provirus is etfectively
part of the host cell’s genome, translating and transcribing
the viral genes along with the cell’s own genes, producing
the proteins required to assemble new copies of the vials,
and transmitting the retroviral DNA to progeny cells.
[0004] If a retrovirus integrates into the gennline of its
host, it can be passed on for generations. These so-called
endogenous retroviruses are believed to make up a signiﬁ-
cant portion of the human genome.

[0005] About 45% of the human genome is composed of
transposable elements. Retrotransposons are a class of these
mobile genetic elements that move and replicate in their host
through an RNA intermediate using reverse transcriptase.
Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotrarisposons in particular
have close structural resemblance to retroviruses. They are
ﬂanked by long terminal direct repeats that contain all of the
necessary transcriptional regulatory elements. The autono-
mous elements (retrotransposons) contain gag and pol
genes, which encode a protease, reverse transcriptase,
RNAse H and integrase. The main difference between
retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons is that retroviruses
include a functional envelope gene, so that they can form
transmittable viral particles that can infect other cells.
[0006] Retrotranspons may interfere with genome integ-
rity. Mammalian germ cells in particular, have come up with
effective tools for retroelement surveillance. In mammals,
trarLsposon surveillance is crucial in oocytes during fetal
oocyte attrition, a process where about 75% of egg cells are
deemed “inadequate” and die. In oocytes, MARFI functions
as a retrotransposon surveillance tool. Mutations of MARFI
cause female infertility

[0007] Human immunodeﬁciency virus (HIV) is a retro-
virus that causes Acquired Immunodeﬁciency Syndrome

Jan. 3], 2019

(AIDS) in humans. Since 1981, an estimated 25 million
people are have died from HIV infections globally. The
disease has proven extremely diﬂicult to treat. The viral
envelope is made up largely of human glycoproteins and
lipids, while the viral envelope proteinithe only viral DNA
exposed to the immune systemiis variable, and the virus
may be dormant and virtually undetectable for long periods.
This makes the development of effective vaccines challeng-
ing.

[0008] HIV can be divided into two major types, HIV type
1 (HIV-1) and HIV type 2 (HIV-2), The HIV-1 Group M
viruses predominate and are responsible for the AIDS pan-
demic. HIV-l Group M can be further subdivided into
subtypes based on genetic sequence data. Some of the
subtypes are known to be more virulent or are resistant to
different medications. HIV-2 viruses are thought to be less
virulent and transmissible than HIV-l Group M viruses,
although HIV-2 is also known to cause AIDS. While HIV-l
Group M subtypes C and A make up about 74% of HIV
infections globally, most infections in North America and
Europe are subtype B.

[0009] Glycoproteins in the HIV envelope bind to CD4+
T helper cells, as well as macrophages and dendritic cells.
Once bound, the retrovirus enters the cell by membrane
fusion and starts transcribing its RNA genome to a DNA
genome on its way to the nucleus. The HIV includes
integrase, which integrates this DNA into the host genome
as a provirus. When activated, the provirus transcribes
mRNA, as well as enzymes and structural proteins to make
up the virus. The Viral mRNA is transported out to the
cytoplasm where packaging occurs. The packaged Virions
then bud out of the host cell, carrying with them lipids and
glycoproteins from the host cell membrane, to infect more
cells. The HIV provirus may be relatively dormant for long
periods, and is able to hide from the immune system by
producing undetectable amounts of viral proteins. An
unknown signal causes the HIV provirus to “activate,” so
that it replicates and releases vims. The infected cells may
be killed by the virus directly or via triggering of apoptosis,
or they may be destroyed by cytotoxic CD8+ cells that
recognize a foreign antigen on the surface of the infected
cells. Once the infected cell types, particularly the CD4+ T
cells, decline below a critical level, the immune system can
no linger provide cell-mediated immunity, and the patient
becomes very susceptible to opportunistic infections and
cancers.

[0010] An HIV positive person is diagnosed with AIDS
when his or her CD4 cell count falls below 200 cells/pl or

CD4 T-lymphocyte percentage of total lymphocytes is less
than 14%.

[0011] HIV has a unique pseudodiploid genome, as well as
low replication ﬁdelity, and a complex viral envelope,
making it able to evolve quickly and develop resistance to
drugs or vaccines. The viral proliferation can be inhibited by
aggressive antiviral therapies such as HAART (Highly
Active Antiretroviral Therapy), which is a triple (or more)7
drug therapy method combining inhibitors of binding and
entry, reverse transcriptase, integration, transcription,
assembly, and release. Such combinations therapies are very
expensive and debilitating. There is, however, no cure for
the disease, so the therapy must be continued for as long as
the patient can tolerate the side etfects or until the virus
evolves to become resistant to the treatment.

isolated from adenovirus. In some embodiments, to avoid
risk of triggering an immune response to the vector, the
vector is administered ex vivo, to blood cells, for example
CD4+ cells, which are removed, transfected, and then
returned to the body only after the vector titer is substantially
reduced. In some embodiments, the vector will comprise a
selectable marker, for example an antibiotic resistance gene,
wherein the antibiotic is one such as kanamycin which
would kill the packaging cell line in the absence of the
resistance gene, so that the packaging cell line is under
selective pressure to produce the vector. Non-replicating AV
and AAV vectors are commercially available from many
sources, e.g., from Vector Biolabs (Malvern, Pa.) or Agilent
(Santa Clara, Calif.), for example Agilent’s AdEasy adeno-
viral vector system that uses recombination with a phage
produced in E. coli to insert the gene of interest.

[0083] In some embodiments the invention provides
MARFl or a vector comprising a gene for MARFl, e,g., as
described in Vector 1, et seq., as a therapeutic agent, e.g., for
treatment of a retroviral infection in a human, e.g., in
accordance with Method 1 et seq. The invention further
provides the use of a sequence expressing MARFl in the
manufacture of a therapeutic agent, e.g., Vector 1 et seq.,
e,g., for use in treating a retroviral infection in a human, e,g.,
in accordance with Method 1 et seq.

[0084] Without intending to be bound by theory, it is
proposed that the mechanism of MARFl’s efﬁcacy to
silence a retroviral provirus is similar to the mec anism as
seen in MARFl ’s silencing of retrotransposons in oocytes,

[0085] Certain types of transposable elements, for
example Class 1 transposable elements or retrotransposons,
are ﬁrst transcribed from DNA to RNA, then the RNA
produced is reverse transcribed to DNA. This c0 ied DNA
is then inserted at a new position into the genome. The
reverse transcription step is catalyzed by a reverse tran-
scriptase, which may be encoded by a coding region in the
transposable element. Retroviruses like HIV and some ret-
rotransposons both contain long terminal repeats .iTRs) and
encode reverse transcriptase. Indeed, it is thought that ret-
rotransposons may be descended from ancient retroviral
infections. The LTRs act to mediate integration of the
retroviral DNA via an LTR speciﬁc integrase into the host
chromosome. Aretroviral provirus can thus be un erstood as
a particular type of eukaryotic retrotransposon, which can
produce RNA intermediates that, rather than producing
DNA which reintegrates into the host genome, wi 1 leave the
host cell and produce DNA that can integrate into the
genome of other cells.

[0086] While the exact mechanism is not known, it
appears that MARFl recognizes and stimulates methylation
of retrotransposons in oocytes, Once the retrotransposons
are methylated, their expression is also suppressed in prog-
eny cells. Thus MARFl is not normally expressed or needed
in somatic cells, because the gene silencing of the retrotrans-
posons is already carried out in the oocyte and persists in the
somatic cells. But somatic cells are capable of suppressing
expression of genes through methylation or other epigenetic
means, so the basic mechanism for suppression normally
should be available in somatic cells as in oocytes,

 

[0087] While the regulators for gene expression may Vary
(primarily MARFl in oocytes, primarily tumor suppressor
factors in somatic cells) the basic machinery for gene
suppression (e.g., histone deacetylase and DNA methylase)

Jan. 3], 2019

appears to be ubiquitous, and thus potentially available for
use by MARFl if MARFl is provided to somatic cells,

[0088] Azidothymidine (AZT) is a nucleoside analog
reverse-transcriptase inhibitor that was used as an effective
antiviral for HIV until a mutant AZT-resistant strain took
over. AZT is shown to have a profound effect on fetal oocyte
attrition, increasing oocyte numbers in mice, as FOA is
largely dependent on favoring oocytes with less LINE-l
retrotransposon activity. This suggests some functional
homology between retroviral proviruses and retrotranspo-
sons and supports the theory that a mechanism that silences
one could be eﬁective to silence the other.

[0089] One could think of a cell infected with a retrovirus
as facing a problem (a potentially disruptive retrotranspo-
son), which is routinely managed with extremely high
eﬁiciency at the oocyte level, but which is only rarely seen
at the somatic cell level. The proposal involves bringing a
tool from the oocyte (MARFl) to ﬁx an analogous problem
in a somatic cell.

[0090] In some embodiments, the invention involves
administering to HIV positive patients a vector expressing
the meiosis arrest female 1 (MARFl) gene, or alternatively,
isolating, treating and reintroducing their CD4+ T—cells. The
MARFl should permanently suppress the HIV provirus by
selective methylation, so that the provirus will also be
suppressed in progeny cells. CD4+ T-cells with HIV provi-
rus suppressed should have a selective advantage over the
non-suppressed cells.

[0091] Although the expression of the retroviral provirus
in a particular cell line will be permanently silenced follow-
ing exposure to MARFl, there is still some risk of reinfec-
tion from cells that are not treated with the MARFl. This
risk can be reduced by continued treatment with conven-
tional antiviral therapies, which suppress infection, or it may
be desirable to use a vector that will permanently transform
cells containing a retroviral provirus with a gene constitu-
tively expressing MARF], so that such cells will be resistant
to subsequent retroviral infection. This approach has the
advantage that the transformed cells will have a selective
advantage over the nontransformed cells in the presence of
the virus, but may also carry additional risks, however,
insofar as the integration of the MARFl transgene may
disrupt other genes, and the long-term effect of constitutive
MARFl expression is not known.

[0092] The foregoing description of certain preferred
embodiment(s) and the following examples are in no way
intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses.

EXAMPLE 1

Demonstration that MARFl can Silence Genes in
Somatic Cells (CD4+ Cells)

[0093] MARFl should be able to target ﬁrst a variety of
retrotransposons, and then a retrovirus, as a retrovirus is
essentially a retrotranspon with envelope protein. Introduc-
ing MARFl into somatic cells should show a decrease in
levels of retrotransposon mRNA and when tested with a
retrovirus, show a decrease in virus titer.

[0081] 119. Any foregoing Vector further comprising a

[0082] In other embodiments, the invention provides a
packaging cell line which expresses a vector as described in
Vector 1 et seq. For example, where the vector is a replica-
tion-deﬁcient viral vector, the packaging cell line will
express in trans the genes required to permit replication of
the vector in the cell line. For example, in some embodi-
ments, to introduce high levels of expressed MARF1 in
somatic cells, the vector may be an adenoviral (AV) vector,
e.g., a serotype 5 adenovirus, wherein the adenovirus is
engineered to be nonreplicative and nonpathogenic, e.g., by
deletion of all or part of E] (which is necessary for repli-
cation) and E3 (to provide room for insert of the gene of
interest), In this case, the vector can be produced in a
packaging cell line that is engineered to express the El
necessary for the virus to replicate. AV vectors are useﬁil
because they infect and express in many cell types including
nondividing cells and typically will not integrate into the
human genome. In other embodiments, AAV vectors may be
used, provided the size of the MARF1 expression cassette is
small enough to ﬁt in the AAV vector, e.g., less than about
4.7 Kb. In this embodiment, the recombinant AAV will
preferably have the replication and capsid genes are pro-
vided in trans (in pRep/Cap plasmid), so that only the two
ITRs of AAV genome are left and packaged into virion,
while the adenovirus genes required are provided either
provided by adenovirus or another plasmid, so that risk for
the recombinant AAV to replicate in the cells is very low, For
example, in one embodiment, the AAV vector is made by
co-transfection of AAV production cells with three plasmids:
(1) an AAV2 ITR-containing plasmid carrying the MARF1
expression cassette; (2) a plasmid that carries the AAV2
Rep-Cap; and (3) a plasmid that provides the helper genes

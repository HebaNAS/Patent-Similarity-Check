[0164] Data analysis with Conduction Inhomogeneity.
MATLAB (Mathworks, Natick, Mass.) was used for all
ofﬂine signal analysis in this study. Conduction inhomoge-
neity analysis was performed using the high density
UNEMAP recordings obtained during sinus rhythm and
pacing. The bipolar electrograms were highpass ﬁltered at
30 Hz, rectiﬁed, and then lowpass ﬁltered at 20 Hz. The
times of the ﬁltering peaks were considered the activation
time for that activation. Conduction inhomogeneity was
calculated as described by Lammers W J, Schalij M J,
Kirchhof C J, Allessie M A. Quantiﬁcation of spatial inho-
mogeneity in conduction and initiation of reentrant atrial
arrhythmias. Am J Physiol 1990; 259:HlZS4-63. Total acti-

[0165] Gene Injection/Transfer.

[0166] After the completion of the initial EPS, 10 mg of
plasmid DNA [control plasmid (pUBc-lacZ) or NOX2
shRNA-encoded plasmid expression vector under the con-
trol of the U6 pol III promoter (FIG. 4)] (Oil mg/each site)
was directly injected transmurally in the PLA with a
27-gauge needle Electric pulses were delivered to the
myocardium through the electrodes spaced 1 cm apart
(Genetrodes, BTX). Immediately alter the injection, 8 elec-
trical pulses (amplitude, 200 V; duration, 10 ms; intervals, 1
sec) were delivered with a square-wave electroporation
generator (ECM 830, BTX, Harvard Apparatus)

[0167] HF Induction.

[0168] In 11 dogs, HF was induced by 3 to 4 weeks ofright
ventricular tachypacing (240 beats per minute) by an
implanted pacemaker. In all dogs, a pacemaker was placed
on the ventricle via an epicardial approach (that is, via a leﬁ
lateral thoracotomy). Left ventricular function was assessed
during pacing by serial echocardiograms (data not shown).
HF was conﬁrmed aﬁer 3 to 4 weeks of pacing.

[0169] Terminal surgery and open chest electrophysiology
mapping. At the terminal study, a left lateral thoracotorny
was perfomied. Low density and high density mapping
protocols were used. With low density mapping, the poste-

rior left atrium (PLA), leﬁ superior pulmonary vein (PV),
and left atrial appendage could be mapped simultaneously.
The FLA and LAA were mapped using two rectangular
plaques containing 21 electrodes each (7x3 electrodes, inter-
electrode distanc¥5 mm) from which 18 bipolar EGMs
were recorded. FIG. 3A shows the schematics of the plaques.
The signals from the low density plaques were recorded and
stored at a 977 Hz sampling rate with the GE Prucka
Cardiolab system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wis).
[0170] High density mapping was performed in all dogs
for more detailed electrophysiological analysis, including
assess of conduction heterogeneity (inhomogeneity). Map-
ping was performed sequentially in the PLA and LAA with
a triangular plaque containing 130 electrodes (inter-elec-
trode distance of 2.5 mm) from which 117 bipolar electro-
grams (EGMs) were recorded. The UNEMAP mapping
system (Univ. of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand) was
used for recording and storing the EGMs at a 1 kHz
sampling rate Even though we did not separately map the
PVs during high-density mapping (owing to the relatively
large surface area of the high density plaques, it was
technically challenging to cover the PVs, which have a
circular and uneven surface), the high-density plaque did
straddle the proximal PVs during PLA mapping.

[0171] A transvenous pacemaker was placed in the right
atrium (RA) Via a jugular venous approach. One week later,
the animal underwent a left lateral thoracotorny. Open chest
electrophysiological mapping was performed as follows:
[0172] Initial Open Chest Electrophysiological Mapping
[0173] Eifective Refractory Periods (ERPs). ERPs were
obtained using two rectangular, 2l-electrode plaques epi-
cardially positioned on the PLA and LAA. ERPs were
obtained from ﬁve evenly distributed sites in the both the
PLA and LAA.

[0174] AF induciblility. AF was induced with burst pac-
ing. AF was deﬁned as episodes lasting more than 3 seconds.
Sustained AF was deﬁned as AF>60 seconds.

[0175] Activation Mapping. High density activation map-
ping was performed using the UNEMAP mapping system
(Univ. of Auckland, Auckland, New Zealand) A triangular
plaque containing 130 electrodes (inter-electrode distance of
2.5 mm) were used to record 117 bipolar EGMs at a 1 kHz
sampling rate. Mapping was performed sequentially in the
LAA and in two adjacent sites in the PLA. At each site, 10
second recordings were made during sinus rhythm and
pacing with cycle lengths of 400, 300, and 200 ms.

[0176] Gene injection/transfer. After the completion of the
initial electrophysiological study, 10 mg of plasmid [control
plasmid (pUBc-lacZ) or NOX2 shRNA-encoded plasmid
expression vector under the control of the U6 pol III
promoter (FIG. 4))] (diluted in 5 ml sterile saline) was
injected sub-epicardially in the PLA with a 27-gauge needle;
5-6 injections (approximately 1 ml each) were used to cover
the entire PLA. After gene injection, electroporation was
performed at each site of gene injection (200 V; duration, 10
ms; intervals, 1 sec).

rapid atrial pacing
[0178] Serial testing for sustained AF, Every 24-48 hours,
pacing was stoppec for 30-60 minutes, in order to assess for
onset of AF and for duration of the induced AF.

[0179] Terminal surgery and open chest electrophysiology
mapping. Alter 3 weeks of rapid atrial pacing (RAP), repeat
open chest electrophysiological mapping was performed, If
the animal revertec to sinus rhythm, atrial effective refrac-
tory periods were assessed, AF electrograms were also
recorded.
[0180] After the electrophysiological study was com-
pleted, the heart was removed and the atria snap frozen. The
atria was subjectec to further analysis to assess for gene
expression, expression of key signaling molecules etc.

gia as previously described by us. After marking the exact
orientation of the high density plaques, tissue samples were
taken from the PLA and LAA regions of the left atrium and
snap frozen in liquid nitrogen, Samples were saved in the
exact orientation in which high density mapping had been
performed, All samples were initially saved at —80° C, The
oriented tissue samples were frozen in Tissue-Tek OCT
(Optimal Cutting Temperature) compound at —80° C,
[0183] For paraﬂinization, the tissue was thawed and a
quick wash given to dean off all the OCT, Using a PCF
LEICA 1050 Tissue Processor, the tissue was embedded in
paraﬁn, The tissue processor uses 10% NBF(Neutral Buff-
ered Formalin) for ﬁxing and the tissue dehydration is
performed with incremental concentrations of Ethanol(E-
TOH). ETOH is exchanged with xylene and ﬁnally xylene is
exchanged with paraﬂin at 58° C, Then tissue is embedded
in a paraﬂin block.

[0184] Masson’s Trichrome staining. Tissue sections were
cut 4 pm apart. Paraﬂin was removed by placing the tissue
section in histology grade xylene for two minutes and the
process was repeated four times changing xylene solution
aﬁer every two minutes. Finally, the xylene was washed
away with ETOH for one minute in absolute ETOH, then
again for one more minute with fresh absolute ETOH,
followed by wash in 95% ETOH for 30 seconds, and
subsequently in 70% ETOH for 45 seconds. ETOH was then
washed with water for one minute, The tissue section was
then ready for staining. The section was treated with Bouin’s
mordant at room temperature overnight, The following day
the tissue section was rinsed in running water to remove
excess yellow, The tissue section was stained in Weigert’s
Solution for 7 minutes, Next, it was dipped once in 1% acid
alcohol and immediately rinsed. The section was then
stained in Beibrich Scarlet-Acid fuchsin for 2 minutes,

followed by a rinse in distilled water. Subsequently, the
tissue section was stained in phosphomolybdic-phospho-
tungstic acid solution for 6 minutes, followed by another
rinse in distilled water. The issue section was then stained in
Aniline Blue solution for 5 minutes, followed by another
rinse in distilled water Immediately, the tissue was dipped
once in 1%Glacial acetic acid and quickly rinsed The tissue
section was then dehydrated in twice in each concentration
of 95% and 100% of ETOH, which was later exchanged with
xylene. A coverslip was ﬁnally placed on the tissue section
for microscope examination, Examples of results of such
assays are illustrated in FIG. llA-C.

[0185] ox-CAMKII immunoﬂuorescence. Tissue samples
were ﬁxed and stained with anti-ox-CAMKII antibody.
Exemplary results of such assays are illustrated in FIGS. 6A,

[0186] Real-time PCR. Frozen tissue samples were frozen
crushed and homogenized, Total RNA was isolated using
Trizol Reagent (Life Technologies, 15596-026), Contami-
nating DNA was removed using DNA-free DNA Removal
Kit (Life Technologies, AM1906), cDNA was synthesized
from 05 pg of total RNA with TaqMan reverse transcription
reagents SuperScript VILO (Life Technologies, #11755050)
and mixed with TaqMan Fast Advanced Master Mix (Life
Technologies, #4444965), Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT—
PCR) was carried out using Applied Biosystems® 7500 Fast
Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies). Relative
mRNA levels were calculated by the (type of software) after
normalization of each experimental sample to GAPDH
levels. An example of results of such assays is illustrated in
FIG. 9A.

[0187] Western Blot Analysis, The atrial tissue was snap
frozen in liquid nitrogen, homogenized, and separated into
membrane and cytosolic fractions according to the proce-
dures of the Mem-Per Plus Membrane Protein Extraction Kit
(l‘hermo-Scientiﬁc, #89842) or T—Per Tissue Protein Extrac-
tion Reagent (Thermo-Scientiﬁc, 78510) for total protein.
We added Halt Protease & Phosphatase Inhibitor Cocktail
(Thermo-Scientiﬁc, #78446) to all buffers, Protein concen-
trations were determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay
Kit (Thermo—Scientiﬁc, #23227). Proteins were fractionated
by SDS-PAGE, transferred to polyvinyl diﬂuoride (PVDF)
membrane, blocked with 5% BSA, and blotted with the
appropriate primary and secondary antibodies, Examples of
results of such assays are illustrated in FIG, 3 and FIG, 9B.

[0188] Measurement of NADPH-dependent superoxide
production by chemiluminescence. 100 mg frozen tissue
samples were crushed and rotor homogenized (Biospec
Products Inc, Tissue-Tearor) with protease inhibitor (Halt
protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktail, Thermo-Scien-
tiﬁc, #1861282), Protein concentrations were determined
using Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit ('I'hermo-Scientiﬁc,
#23227), Lucigenin (5 prnol/L) (Enzo Life Sciences, ALX-
620-061-M050) and NADPH (100 umol/L) (Calbiochem,
#181973) were each added in the presence and absence of
apocynm (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, #sc-203321) (an
inhibitor of NADPH oxidase) and mito-TEMPO (Santa sz
Biotechnology, #sc-221945) (a mitochondrial ROS inhibi-
tor), and the photon outputs were measured using a lumi-
nometer (Berthold Technologies, LUMAT LB 9507), An
example of this assay is described for PLA and LLA tissue
samples from normal and HF dogs in FIGS. 2A, B.

The NADPH oxidase enzyme family are a major source of
cardiovascular ROS (Murdoch C E, Zhang M, Cave A C,
Shah A Mi “NADPH oxidase-dependent redox signalling in
cardiac hypertrophy, remodelling and failure,” Cardiavasc.
Res. 2006; 71:208-15; Cave A C, Braver A C, Narayana-
panicker A et al “NADPH oxidases in cardiovascular health
and disease,"Antiaxia' Redax, Signal 2006; 8:691-728) with
NOX2 being the dominant ROS-generating NADPH iso-
form in HF (Nabeebaccus A, Zhang M, ShahA M. “NADPH
oxidases and cardiac remodeling,” Hean Fail Reta 2011;
16:5-12; Maejima Y, Kuroda J, Matsushima S, Ago T,
Sadoshima J . “Regulation of myocardial growth and death

“NADPH oxidase-derived reactive oxygen species in the
regulation of endothelial phenotype,” Pharmacal. Rep
2008; 60121-8). However, more recent studies indicate that
NOX4 in mitochondria plays an essential role in mediating
OS during pressure overload-induced cardiac hypertrophy
(Nabeebaccus A, Zhang M, Shah A M, “NADPH oxidases
and cardiac remodeling,” Heart Fail Rev, 2011; 1625-12;
Kuroda J, Ago T, Matsushima S, Zhai P, Schneider M D,
Sadoshima J1 “NADPH oxidase 4 (Nox4) is a major source
of oxidative stress in the failing heart,” Prac, Natl, Acad Sci
USA. 2010; 107:15565-70; Zhang M, BrewerAC, Schro-
der K et al. “NADPH oxidase-4 mediates protection against
chronic load-induced stress in mouse hearts by enhancing
angiogenesis,” Prac. Natl. Acad Sci, USA, 2010: 107:
18121-6) NOX4 also appears to contribute signiﬁcantly to
the formation of ﬁbrosis; in addition, it appears to be
activated by pro-ﬁbrotic signaling pathways e.g, TGF-B
(Yeh Y H, Kuo C T, Chang G J, Qi X Y, Nattel S, Chen W
J, “Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase 4
mediates the diﬁerential responsiveness of atrial versus
ventricular ﬁbroblasts to transforming growth factor-beta,”

Perino A, Ghigo A, Hirsch E, Shah A Mi “NADPH oxidases
in heart failure: poachers or gamekeepers‘?” Antioxia' Redox.
Signal. 2013; 18:1024-41),

[0008] Recent evidence indicates that OS also contributes
to structural and electrical remodeling in AF, Mihm et al,
demonstrated signiﬁcant oxidative damage in atrial append-
ages of AF patients undergoing the Maze procedure (Huang
C X, Liu Y, Xia W F, Tang Y H, Huang H, Oxidative stress:
a possible pathogenesis of atrial ﬁbrillation. Med Hypoth-
eses 2009; 72:466-7), Carnes et al showed that dogs with
sustainedAF had an increase in protein nitration, suggesting
enhanced OS (Carries C A, Janssen P M, Ruehr M L et al,
“Atrial glutathione content, calcium current, and contractil-
ity,”J. Biol. Chem, 2007; 282:28063-73; Carries CA, Chung
M K, Nakayama T et al. “Ascorbate attenuates atrial pacing-
induced peroxynitrite formation and electrical remodeling
and decreases the incidence of postoperative atrial ﬁbrilla-
tion,” Circ. Res, 2001; 892E32-8). Kim et al showed that
NADPH oxidase (NOX2) Was a major source of atrial ROS
in patients with AF (Kim Y M, Guzik T J, Zhang Y H et al
“A myocardial Nox2 containing NAD(P)H oxidase contrib-
utes to oxidative stress in human atrial ﬁbrillation,” Circ.
Res. 2005; 97:629-36). More recently, Reilly et al. have

Jan. 31, 2019

shown that atrial sources of ROS vary with the duration and
substrate of AF, with NADPH oxidase being elevated early
in AF (e.g, with post-operative AF) and With mitochondrial
oxidases and uncoupled NOS being noted in long standing
AF (Reilly S N, Jayaram R, Nahar K et a1 “Atrial sources of
reactive oxygen species vary with the duration and substrate
of atrial ﬁbrillation: implications for the antiarrhythmic
effect of statins," Circulation 2011; 124:1107—17). More
recent data demonstrates that NOX4iwhich, as mentioned
above, appears to contribute to the generation of mitochon-
drial ROS, speciﬁcally 111202 (which more explicitly pro-
motes ﬁbrosis (Cucoranu l, Clempus R, Dikalova A et a1.
“NAD(P)H Oxidase 4 Mediates Transforming Growth Fac-
tor-l-lnduced Differentiation of Cardiac Fibroblasts lnto
Myoﬂbroblasts," Circ. Res. 2005; 97:900-7))7is also
elevated in AF (Joun et al. (2013) supra; Zhang J, Youn J Y,
Kim A et al, “NOX4-dependent Hydrogen Peroxide Over-
production in Human Atrial Fibrillation and HL-l Atrial
Cells: Relationship to Hypertension,” Front, Physiol, 2012;
3)

[0009] The detrimental electrical effects of an enhanced,
pathological late IN“ include the following: (i) diastolic
depolarization during phase 4 of the AP that may lead to
spontaneous AP ﬁring and abnormal automaticity, (ii) an
increase of AP duration, which may lead to EADs and
triggered activity, as well as increased spatiotemporal dif-
ferences of repolarlzation time, which promote reentrant
electrical activity; and (iii) the indirect elfects of a late
lNa-induced increase of Na+ entry to alter Ca2+ homeostasis
in myocytes, which may lead to Ca2+ alternans and DADs.
Acquired conditions and drugs that enhance late 1M, are
associated with atrial tachyarrhythmias, ventricular tachyar-
rhythmias including torsades de pointes (TdP), aﬁerpoten-
tials (EADs, DADs), and triggered activity (Shryock J C,
Song Y, Rajamani S, Antzelevitch C, Belardinelli L. “The
arrhythmogenic consequences of increasing late IN], in the
cardiomyocy‘te,” Cardiovasc. Res. 2013; 99:600-11), Recent
investigations implicate a role for abnormal Ca2+ handling
in the genesis of ventricular and atrial arrhythmias (Aistrup
G L, Balke C W, Wasserstrom J A, Arrhythmia triggers in
heart failure: the smoking gun of [Caz‘], dysregulation,”
Heart Rhythm, 2011; 8:1804-8; Antoons G, Sipido K R.
“Targeting calcium handling in arrhythmias,” Europace
2008; 10:1364-9; Laurita K R, Rosenbaum D S. “Mecha-
nisms and potential therapeutic targets for ventricular
arrhythmias associated with impaired cardiac calcium
cycling,” J. Mol. Cell Cardiol 2008; 44:31—43), Abnormal
Ca2+ handling can contribute to arrhythmogenesis directly
by triggering abnormal depolarizations and indirectly by
modulating action potential time course and duration, DADs
are typically result from cellular Ca2+ overload, with SCR
increasing forward NCX and producing an inward current
resulting in DADs (Antoons et al. (2008) supra; Volders P G,
Vos M A, Szabo B et al “Progress in the understanding of
cardiac early afterdepolarizations and torsades de pointes:
time to revise current concepts,” Cardiovasc, Res. 2000;
46:376-92), More recent evidence has accumulated for
Cab-mediated EADs (Volders et a1. (2000) supra), which
could contribute to triggered activity or at least prolong
action potential durationi Indeed, abnormal Caz‘ cycling and
resulting Ca2+ transient alternans predisposes to changes in
the action potential that set up conditions for reentry (Laurita
et al. (2008) supra). Abnormal SR Ca2+ release has also been
suggested to contribute to reentry in the intact atria, includ-

compared to normal animals (FIG. 2A). NADPH oxidase is
a major source of superoxide generation in PLA from HF
animals compared to normal animals (FIG. ZB) depicts
contribution of 02’ production in PLA for NADPH oxidase
(blue bars), Mitochondrial ROS (red bars), NOS (green bars)
and Xanthine oxidase (purple bars). Furthermore, HF ani-
mals display higher levels of NOX2 polypeptide subunit
(gle) as compared to normal animals (FIGS. 3A, B).
[0133] A plasmid encoding either NOX2 shRNA (FIG. 4
and SEQ ID NOs: l and 2) or a control RNA (lac Z) was
introduced into PLA tissues of HF animals and the effects on
AF were evaluated The duration of AF (seconds) is
decreased in plasmid encoding NOX2 shRNA-treated ani-
mals (“NOX2 shRNA”) compared with lacZ-transfected
control animals (“HF (LacZ Control)") (FIG, 5), Moreover,
expression of ox-CAMKII in the PLA of HF dogs trans-
fected with NOX2 shRNA (FIG. 6B) is lower than expres-
sion of ox-CAMKII in the PLA of HF dogs (FIG. 6A), which
is consistent with NOX2 shRNA knocking down NOX2
expression and lowering oxidative stress in atrial tissues.
[0134] Electrophysiological measurements were recorded
for animals following 3 weeks of rapid atrial pacing. Eﬁec-
tive Refractory Periods (ERPs) were increased signiﬁcantly
following pacing conditioning; however, ERPs did not
change signiﬁcantly as a function of NOX2 knockdown
using NOX2 shRNA (F IG. 7). Conduction was less hetero-
geneous in PLA transfected with plasmid encoding NOX2
shRNA compared to FLA transfected with control plasmid
(FIGS. 8A, B) and NOX2 shRNA abolished signiﬁcant
change noted in the conductive inhomogeneity index (FIGS.
8C, D).

[0135] NOX2 mRNA and protein is reduced in PLA
transfected with plasmid encoding NOX2 shRNA compared
to FLA transfected with control plasmid (FIGS. 9A, B).
Similarly, the relative contribution of superoxide production
attributed to NADPH oxidase is lower in FLA transfected
with plasmid encoding NOX2 shRNA compared to FLA
transfected with control plasmid (FIG. 10).

[0136] In addition to using traditional heart monitoring
methodologies to detect the presence and absence of AF as
a function of NOX2 shRNA therapy, AF EGM characteris-
tics can be systematically assessed to evaluate structural
remodeling of atrial tissue in candidate subjects as well as
therapeutic eﬂicacy of the pharmaceutical compositions for
inhibiting oxidative stress for subjects suffering from
chronic AF. Subjects who sulfer from chronic AF have
structural remodeled atrial tissue with ﬁbrosis. In this regard,
ﬁbrosis was reduced in animals whose PLA was transfected
with plasmid encoding NOX2 shRNA compared to control
animals (FIG. 11A-C),

[0137] Application of EGM-guided identiﬁcation and
monitoring of ﬁbrosis-associated structural remodeling of
atrial tissue in AF and HF is summarized by related patent
application publications by the inventors, such as applica-
tion entitled “INHIBITION OF FIBROSIS AND AF BY
TGF-BETA INHIBITION IN THE POSTERIOR LEFT

[0138] In another model, electrical remodeling of atrial
tissues can lead to spontaneous AF. Such a model reﬂects AF
in a subject who otherwise might not have signiﬁcant
structural remodeling of atrial tissue due to ﬁbrosis (for
example, young subjects), Pacemakers can be used to gen-
erate rapid tachypacing in the canine model of electrical
remodeling of atrial tissue. Heart monitors (for example,
ECG or EKG patterns) can be used to detect AF develop-
ment as well as the eﬁicacy of NOX2 shRNA treatment
eﬁicacy in atrial tissues by measuring the decline or absence
of AF following treatment. In this regard, the onset of AF
episodes was blocked in animals whose PLA was transfected
with plasmid encoding NOX2 shRNA, as compared to
normal animals following rapid atrial pacing of the animals
(FIG. 12). Applicability to other NOX2 inhibitors.

[0139] The results of the NOX2 shRNA studies demon-
strate the feasibility of a general strategy to inhibit NADPH
oxidase by targeting NOX2 using NOX2 inhibitors. Such
inhibitor agents include oligonucleotide-based compounds
that target the NOX2 mRNA or protein, such as RNAi
molecules and shRNAs directed against NOX2 mRNA and
oligonucleotide-based aptamers directed against the NOX2
polypeptide. Furthermore, small molecule organic com-
pounds having anti-NADPH oxidase activity by speciﬁcally
binding to or otherwise interfering with NOX2 protein
functionality can also reduce NADPH oxidase-mediated
superoxide production and oxidative stress in AF.

[0140] In some embodiments, NOX2 inhibitors comprise
any suitable bioactive molecules (eg. a molecule capable of
inhibiting the function of NADPH oxidase). In some
embodiments, a NOX2 inhibitor comprises a macromol-
ecule. polymer, a molecular complex, protein, peptide, poly-
peptide, nucleic acid, carbohydrate, small molecule, etc.
[0141] In some embodiments, a NOX2 inhibitor is a
NOX2 inhibitory peptide. In some embodiments, the present
invention provides peptides of any suitable amino acid
sequence capable of inhibiting one or more alleles of NOX2.
In some embodiments, peptides provided by or encoded by
the compositions of embodiments of the present invention
may comprise any arrangement of any standard amino acids
(eg. alanine, arginine, asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine,
glutamic acid, glutamine, glycine, histidine, isoleucine, leu-
cine, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine, proline, serine,
threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine, and valine) or non-standard
amino acids (e.g. D-amino acids, chemically or biologically
produced derivatives of common amino acids, selenocyste-
ine, pyrrolysine, lanthionine, 2-aminoisobutyric acid, dehy-
droalanine, etc.), In some embodiments, NOX2 inhibitory
peptides are inhibitors to NOX2.

[0142] In some embodiments, NOX2 inhibitory peptides
are provided to a subject as isolated or puriﬁed peptides, In
some embodiments, NOX2 inhibitory peptides are provided
to a subject as nucleic acid molecules that encode such
peptides. In some embodiments, peptides are optimized to
enhance cell penetration (e.g. sequence optimization,
sequence tag, tagged with a small molecule, etc.).

[0143] In some embodiments, a NOX2 inhibitor is pro-
vided from an isolated nucleic acid comprising a minigene,
wherein said minigene encodes a modiﬁed NOX2 peptide,
wherein the peptide blocks the site of interaction between
NOX2 and N OX2 binding partners in a cell, such as a human
cell. In addition, the minigene can further comprise one or
more of a promoter, a ribosomal binding site, a translation
initiation codon, and a translation termination codon. In

[0127] Kits

[0128] The subject invention also includes kits for inhib-
iting expression of a target gene in a cell, the kit including
a chemically modiﬁed shRNA as described herein. A “kit”
refers to any system for delivering materials or reagents for
carrying out a method of the invention, In the context of
reaction assays, such delivery systems include systems that
allow for the storage, transport, or delivery of reaction
reagents (egl, chemically modiﬁed shRNA, culture
medium, etc, in the appropriate containers) and/or support-
ing materials (eg, huﬁers, written instructions for perform-
ing the assay, etc.) from one location to another For
example, kits include one or more enclosures (e,g., boxes)
containing the relevant reaction reagents and/or supporting
materials. Such contents may be delivered to the intended
recipient together or separately, For example, a ﬁrst con-
tainer may contain a chemically modiﬁed shRNA for use in
an assay, while a second container contains culture media
RNA delivery agents (e.g., transfection reagents).

[0129] As noted above, the subject kits can further include
instructions for using the components of the kit to practice
the subject methods. The instructions for practicing the
subject methods are generally recorded on a suitable record-
ing medium, For example, the instructions may be printed
on a substrate, such as paper or plastic, etc. As such, the
instructions may be present in the kits as a package insert,
in the labeling of the container of the kit or components

thereof (i.e,, associated with the packaging or subpackaging)
etc. In other embodiments, the instructions are present as an
electronic storage data ﬁle present on a suitable computer
readable storage medium, erg. CD-ROM, diskette, etc. In yet
other embodiments, the actual instructions are not present in
the kit, but means for obtaining the instructions from a
remote source, eg via the intemet, are provided, An
example of this embodiment is a kit that includes a web
address where the instructions can be viewed and/or from
which the instructions can be downloaded. As with the
instructions, this means for obtaining the instructions is
recorded on a suitable substrate

[0130] In addition to the subject database, programming

and instructions, the kits may also include one or more
control reagents, e.g., non-chemically modiﬁed shRNA.

[0131] Methods

[0132] The pharmaceutical compositions have therapeutic
efﬁcacy in treating oxidative stress in a subject having atrial
or ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular failure or heart fail-
ure. A pharmaceutical composition comprising a NOXZ
shRNA has demonstrable activity in an art-accepted canine
model for human AF, Experiments were performed with
normal and HF animals to validate the utility of the canine
model to study NOX2 knockdown assays and their eﬁect on
NOX2 expression and superoxide production, The HF ani-

FIELD OF INVENTION

[0003] The present disclosure relates to compositions and
methods for preventing certain cardiac damage. In particu-
lar, compositions and methods of inhibiting oxidative stress
in a subject suifering from atrial ﬁbrillation is provided,

BACKGROUND

[0004] Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the most common heart
rhythm disorder (Benjamin E J, Levy D, Vaziri S M,
D’Agostino R B, BelangerA J, Wolf PA. “Independent risk
factors for atrial ﬁbrillation in a population-based cohort,
The Framingham Heart Study,” JAMA 1994; 271:840—4),
and is a major risk factor for stroke and HF (Balasubrama-
niam R, Kistler P M. AF and “Heart failure: the chicken or
the egg?” Heart 2009; 95:535-9; Lakshminarayan K, Ander-
son D C, Herzog C A, Qureshi A I, “Clinical epidemiology
of atrial ﬁbrillation and related cerebrovascular events in the
United States,” Neurologist 2008; 14:143-50; Lip G Y,
Kakar P, Watson T. “Atrial ﬁbrillationithe growing epi-
demic” [comment], Heart 2007; 93:542-3). Since a majority
of AF triggers arise in the pulmonary veins (PVs) and the
adjoining adjoining posterior leﬁ atrium (PLA), ablation
procedures that electrically isolate the PVs have emerged in
recent years as a viable therapy for focal AF. Nonetheless,
moderately high ablation success rates have only been
achieved in selected patients (Nademanee K, McKenzie J,
Kosar E et a]. “A new approach for catheter ablation of atrial
ﬁbrillation: mapping of the electrophysiologic substrate”
[see cement], J. Am, Coll. Cardiol, 2004; 43:2044-53;
Nademanee K, Schwab M C, Kosar E M et al. “Clinical
outcomes of catheter substrate ablation for high-risk patients
with atrial ﬁbrillation,” 1 Am. Coll. Cardiol, 2008; 51:843-
9; Taylor G W, Kay G N, Zheng Bishop S, Ideker R E,
“Pathological effects of extensive radiofrequency energy
applications in the pulmonary veins in dogs,” Circulation
2000; 101 : 1736-42). Indeed, in patients with structural heart
disease e.g. heart failure (HF), success rates do not exceed
50-60% (Esther H L, Hessling G, Ndrepepa G et a1. “Elec-
trogram-guided substrate ablation with or without pulmo-
nary vein isolation in patients with persistent atrial ﬁbrilla-
tion,” Europace 2008; 10:1281-7; Weerasooriya R, Khairy
P, Litalien J et a1, “Catheter ablation for atrial ﬁbrillation: are
results maintained at 5 years of follow-up?” J, Am. Coll.

Jan. 31, 2019

Cardiol 2011; 57:160-6), One reason for this low efﬁcacy is
that current ablation strategies primarily employ an anatomi-
cal, ‘one—size ﬁts all’ strategy (with some minor variations)
that does not address the speciﬁc mechanisms underlying AF
(Ben Morrison T, Jared Bunch T, Gersh B J, “Pathophysi-
ology of concomitant atrial ﬁbrillation and heart failure:
implications for management,” Natl Clin Pract, Cardio-
vasc, Med 2009; 6:46-56) Recent research has therefore
attempted to better deﬁne the mechanisms underlying AF, in
order to improve upon the success of ablation and to develop
new biological therapies for AF.

[0005] In the setting of structural heart diseaseispeciﬁ-
cally HFia variety of mechanisms e,g. stretch, oxidative
stress (OS), autonomic imbalance and structural changes
such as ﬁbrosis are thought to contribute to a vulnerable AF
substrate (Nattel S. “From guidelines to bench: implications
of unresolved clinical issues for basic investigations of atrial
ﬁbrillation mechanisms,” Can J Cardiol, 2011; 27:19-26;
Nattel S, Burstein B, Dobrev D, “Atrial remodeling and
atrial ﬁbrillation: mechanisms and implications,” Circ,
Arrhythm. Electrophysiol. 2008; 1:62-73), OS is known to
be elevated in the atria in AF (Youn J Y, Zhang J, Zhang Y
et at. “Oxidative stress in atrial ﬁbrillation: an emerging role
ofNADPH oxidase,” J, Mol Cell, Cardiol, 2013; 62172-9)
and reactive oxygen species (ROS) have effects on the atrial
action potential and Ca2+ cycling, However, the precise
effects of ROS on atrial electrophysiology in the intact
atriaiand how these electrophysiological changes contrib-
ute to formation of AF substrateiare not known,

[0006] Oxygen derivatives with instabilities and increased
reactivity, e.g, OZ, HZOz, and OH, are generically termed
ROS (Maejima Y, Kuroda J, Matsushima S, Ago T,
Sadoshima J. “Regulation of myocardial growth and death
by NADPH oxidase,” J. Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2011; 50:408-
16). While ROS at low doses mediates physiological func-
tions such as growth, differentiation, metabolism (idr),
excess ROS damages DNA, protein and lipids, and causes
cell death (id.). A wealth of research points to increased OS
as a key driver of cardiac remodeling caused by chronic
pressure overload, loss of functional myocardium or AF
(Kohlhaas M, Maack C. “Interplay of defective excitation-
contraction coupling, energy starvation, and oxidative stress
in heart failure,” Trend: Cardiovasc. Med 2011; 21:69-73;
Maulik S K, Kumar S, “Oxidative stress and cardiac hyper-
trophy: a review,” beicol, Mech. Methods 2012; 22:359-
66). In addition, chronic ROS elevation activates signaling
pathways such as TGF-I, MAP kinase subfamilies (Hori M,
Nishida K, “Oxidative stress and left ventricular remodel-
ling aﬁer myocardial infarction,” Cardiovas, Res, 2009;
81:457-64; Tsai K H, Wang W J, Lin C W et al, “NADPH
oxidase-derived superoxide anion-induced apoptosis is
mediated via the JNK-dependent activation of NF-kappaB in
cardiomyocytes exposed to high glucose,” J. Cell. Physiol,
2012; 227:1347-57) that result in structural changes e.g.
ﬁbrosisr Moreover, ROS generation (e.g, by Ang II mediated
NOX activation) has been shown to lead to modiﬁcations of
CaMKII (Erickson J R, He B J, Grumbach I M, Anderson M
E. “CaMKII in the cardiovascular system: sensing redox
states,” Physiol, Rev. 2011; 91:889-915), an important ser-
ine-threonine kinase involved in a variety of E—C coupling
related processes in cardiac myocytes.

[0007] ROS are generated by the mitochondrial electron

transport chain, the xanthine oxidase/dehydrogenase system,
‘uncoupled’ NOS, cytochrome P450 and NADPH oxidases.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[0038] The present disclosure provides details of the dis-
covery of pharmaceutical compositions and methods for
inhibiting oxidative stress in a subject suffering from atrial
ﬁbrillation. The method involves targeting reducing reactive
oxygen species (ROS) generated through inhibiting the
action of NADPH oxidase. The principle is demonstrated
using an NOX2 inhibitor based upon RNA interference
(RNAi) with small hairpin RNAs directed against the NOX2
mRNA (N OX2 shRNA), Pharmaceutical compositions
based upon NOX2 shRNA is shown in the method to inhibit
expression of the NOX2 gene, thereby leading to decreased
production of NADPH oxidase in cardiac cells containing
the injected NOX2 shRNAs. Referring to FIG. 1, lower
NADPH oxidase production can lead to lower levels of ROS
produced, lower extents of oxidative stress, decreased
extents of atrial ﬁbrosis and lower atrial ﬁbrillation (AF),
However, one skilled in the art will appreciate that the
principle can be readily extended to other NOX2 inhibitors
with undue experimentation and have a reasonable expec-
tation of achieving similar results as described herein,
Details of the pharmaceutical compositions and methods are
presented in greater detail in this disclosure.

Terminology and Deﬁnitions

[0039] The terminology used herein is for the purpose of
describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended
to be limiting, With respect to the use of substantially, any
plural and/or singular terms herein, those having skill in the
art can translate from the plural as is appropriate to the
context and/or application. The various singular/plural per-
mutations may be expressly set forth herein for the sake of
clarity,

[0040] Terms used herein are intended as “open” terms
(e.gi, the term “including” should be interpreted as “includ-
ing but not limited to,” the term “having” should be inter-
preted as “having at least,” the term “includes” should be
interpreted as “includes but is not limited to,” etc).

[0041] The phrase “such as” should be interpreted as “for
example, including.”

[0042] Furthermore, in those instances where a convention
analogous to “at least one of A, B and C, etc.” is used, in
general such a construction is intended in the sense of one
having ordinary skill in the art would understand the con-
vention (e,g., “a system having at least one of A, B and C”
would include but not be limited to systems that have A
alone, B alone, C alone, A and B together, A and C together,
B and C together, and/or A, B, and C together] It will be
further understood by those within the art that virtually any
disjunctive word and/or phrase presenting two or more

Jan. 31, 2019

alternative terms, whether in the description or ﬁgures,
should be understood to contemplate the possibilities of
including one of the terms, either of the terms, or both terms.
For example, the phrase “A or B” will be understood to
include the possibilities of “A” or ‘B or “A and B.”

[0043] All language such as “up to, at least, greater
than," “less than,” and the like, include the number recited
and refer to ranges which can subsequently be broken down
into subranges as discussed above.

[0044] A range includes each individual member. Thus,
for example, a group having 1-3 members refers to groups
having 1, 2, or 3 members. Similarly, a group having 6
members refers to groups having 1, 2, 3, 4, or 6 members,
and so forth.

[0045] The phrase “small hairpin RNA” and the term
“shRN ”, as used herein, refer to a unimolecular RNA-
containing polynucleotide that is capable of performing
RNAi and that includes a sense sequence, a loop, and an
antisense sequence. The sense and antisense sequences are
sometimes referred to herein as the ﬁrst region and second
region. As described herein, the sense and antisense
sequences can be in different orientations with respect to one
another in an shRNA of the invention (an L or R shRNA).
Thus, if the ﬁrst region of an shRNA is the sense sequence
then the second region is the antisense region, and Vice
versa, Preferably, the sense and antisense sequences are
substantially complementary to each other (about 80%
complementary), The antisense sequence can be about 16 to
about 22 nucleotides in length, e.g., about 16 to 19 nucleo-
tides, and more preferably 18 to 19 nucleotides in length.
The sense sequence can be about 11 to about 22 nucleotides
in length, and more preferably 17 to 19 nucleotides in length.
An shRNA (and other RNAi agents) are “speciﬁc” for a
target gene when the antisense sequence (of about 16 to 22
nucleotides is substantially complementary to the target
gene (or target RNA, e.g., target mRNA). By substantially
complementary is meant that the antisense sequence is at
least 80% complementary to the target gene (or gene prod-
uct), Thus, in some embodiments, the antisense sequence
that is complementary to the target gene can contain mis-
matches to the target. The sequence can be varied to target
one or more genetic variants or phenotypes of a target, e.g.,
a viral target, by altering the targeting sequence to be
complementary to the sequence of the genetic variant or
phenotype. An shRNA may have a loop as long as, for
example, 0 to about 24 nucleotides in length, preferably 0 to
about 10 nucleotides in length, 0 to 6 nucleotides in length,
e.g., 2 nucleotides in length. The sequence of the loop can
include nucleotide residues unrelated to the target. In one
particularly preferred embodiment, the loop is 5‘-UU-3'. In
some embodiments it may include non-nucleotide moieties.
In yet other embodiments, the loop does not include any
non-nucleotides moieties, Optionally, the shRNA can have
an overhang region of2 bases on 3' end of the molecule. The
shRNA can also comprise RNAs with stem-loop structures
that contain mismatches and/or bulges. The sense sequence
that is homologous to the target can differ at about 0 to about
5 sites by having mismatches, insertions, or deletions of
from about 1 to about 5 nucleotides, as is the case, for
example, with naturally occurring microRNAs, RNAs that
comprise any of the above structures can include structures
where the loops comprise nucleotides, non-nucleotides, or
combinations of nucleotides and non-nucleotides,

nosquueosine, uridine-S-oxyacetic acid, 2-thiocytidine,
threonine derivatives. and the like. See, for example, US
Pat No 7,410,944.

[0102] In addition, modiﬁed shRNA compounds can also
have substituted or modiﬁed sugar moieties, e.g., 2‘-O-
methoxyethyl sugar moieties, See, for example, US Pat,
No. 7,410,944.

[0103] Preferably, the 3‘ overhangs of the shRNAs of the
present invention are modiﬁed to provide resistance to
cellular nucleases. In one embodiment the 3' overhangs
comprise 2'-de0xyribonucleotides.

[0104] Additional shRNA compounds targeted at different
sites of the mRNA corresponding to NOX2. Additionally, to
assist in the design of shRNAs for the eﬂicient RNA
interference (RNAi)-mediated silencing of any target gene,
several shRNA supply companies maintain web-based
design tools that utilize these general guidelines for “pick-
ing” shRNAs when presented with the mRNA or coding
DNA sequence of the target gene. Examples of such tools
can be found at the web sites of Dharmacon, Inc. (Lafayette,
Colo.), Ambion, Inc. (Austin, Tex.).As an example, picking
shRNAs involves choosing a site/sequence unique to the
target gene (i.ei, sequences that share no signiﬁcant homol-
ogy with genes other than the one being targeted), so that
other genes are not inadvertently targeted by the same
shRNA designed for this particular target sequence.

[0105] Another criterion to be considered is whether or not
the target sequence includes a known polymorphic site If so,
shRNAs designed to target one particular allele may not
effectively target another allele, since single base mis-
matches between the target sequence and its complementary
strand in a given shRNA can greatly reduce the effectiveness
of RNAi-induced by that shRNA. Given that target sequence
and such design tools and design criteria, an ordinarily
skilled artisan apprised of the present disclosure should be
able to design and synthesized additional sihRNA com-
pounds useful in reducing the mRNA level of NOX2.
[0106] shRNA: Administration

[0107] The present invention provides a composition of a
polymer or excipient and one or more vectors encoding one
or more shRNA molecules. The vector can be formulated
into a pharmaceutical composition with suitable carriers and
administered into a mammal using any suitable route of
administration,

[0108] Because of this precision, side effects typically
associated with traditional drugs can be reduced or elimi-
nated, In addition, shRNA are relatively stable, and like
antisense, they can also be modiﬁed to achieve improved
pharmaceutical characteristics, such as increased stability,
deliverability, and ease of manufacture. Moreover, because
shRNA molecules take advantage of a natural cellular path-
way, i,e., RNA interference, they are highly eﬂicient in
destroying targeted mRNA molecules, As a result, it is
relatively easy to achieve a therapeutically effective con-
centration of an shRNA compound in a subject See, for
example, US. Pat. No, 7,410,944,

[0109] shRNA compounds may be administered to mam-
mals by various methods through different routes They can
also be delivered directly to a particular organ or tissue by
any suitable localized administration methods such as direct
injection into a target tissue. Preferably, shRNA compounds

Jan. 31, 2019

can be electroporated into cells following their injection
directly into the target tissue. Alternatively, they may be
delivered encapsulated in liposomes, by iontophoresis, or by
incorporation into other vehicles such as hydrogels, cyclo-
dextrins, biodegradable nanocapsules, and bioadhesive
microspheres,

[0110] In vivo inhibition of speciﬁc gene expression by
RNAi injected intravenously has been achieved in various
organisms including mammals, See, for example, Song E. et
a1. “RNA interference targeting Fas protects mice from
fulminant hepatitis,” Nature Medicine, 92347-3510003).
One route of administration of shRNA molecules of the
invention includes direct injection of the vector at a desired
tissue site, such as for example, into diseased or non-
diseased cardiac tissue, into ﬁbrotic heart tissue, such as
ﬁbrotic PLA tissuei Generally, however, NOX2 shRNAs or
expression vectors encoding NOX2 shRNAs can be directly
injected into any atrial tissue to effectively knock-down
NOX2 protein expression, to inhibit NADPH oxidase
enzyme activity, to effectively reduce ROS levels and oxi-
dative stress in atrial tissues at the sites of injection, to
reduce or altogether eliminate the presence of AF in a
subject, or to reduce progression of ﬁbrosis leading to
increased AF presentation in a subject

[0111] NAPDH oxidase (NOX2) is signiﬁcantly elevated
in the ventricle of heart failure patients, and is thought be a
contributor to the heart failure state. According y, NOX2
shRNAs or expression vectors encoding NOX2 shRNAs can
be directly injected into ventricle tissue to effectively knock-
down NOXZ protein expression, to inhibit NADP 11 oxidase
enzyme activity, to effectively reduce ROS levels and oxi-
dative stress in ventricle tissues at the sites of injection, to
reduce or altogether eliminate progression of ventricle dam-
age leading to increased HF presentation in a su aject.
[0112] In one aspect of the invention, one or more vectors
comprising one or more of shRNA of the invention can be
readministered an unlimited number of times ater a ﬁrst
administration at any time interval or intervals aﬁer the ﬁrst
administration.

[0113] shRNA: Pharmaceutical Compositions
[0114] The shRNA encoding nucleic acids of tie present
invention can be formulated in pharmaceutical composi-
tions, which are prepared according to conventional phar-
maceutical compounding techniques. See, e.g., Remington’s
Pharmaceutical Sciences, 18th Ed. (1990, Mack )ublishing
Co., Easton, Pa), The pharmaceutical compositions of the
invention comprise a therapeutically effective amount of the
vector encoding shRNA. These compositions can comprise,
in addition to the vector, a pharrnaceutically acceptable
excipient, carrier, buffer, stabilizer or other materials well
known in the art. Such materials should be non-toxic and
should not interfere with the efﬁcacy of the active ingredient.
The carrier can take a wide variety of forms depending on
the form of preparation desired for administration, e,g.,
intravenous, oral, intramuscular, subcutaneous, intrathecal,
epineural or parenteral.

[0115] When the vectors of the invention are prepared for
administration, they may be combined with a pharmaceuti-
cally acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient to form a
pharmaceutical formulation, or unit dosage form. The total
active ingredients in such formulations include from 0.1 to
999% by weight of the formulation

[0116] In another aspect of the invention, the vectors of the
invention can be suitably formulated and introduced into the
US 2019/0032058 A1

environment of the cell by any means that allows for a
suﬂicient portion of the sample to enter the cell to induce
gene silencing, if it is to occur. Many formulations or
vectors are known in the art and can be used so long as tie
vectors gain entry to the target cells so that it can act.
[0117] For example, the vectors can be formulated in
buffer solutions such as phosphate buffered saline solutions
comprising liposomes, micellar structures, and capsids. Tie
pharmaceutical formulations of the vectors of the invention
can also take the form of an aqueous or anhydrous solution
or dispersion, or alternatively the form of an emulsion or
suspension. The pharmaceutical formulations of the vectors
of the present invention may include, as optional ingre i-
ents, solubilizing or emulsifying agents, and salts of the type
that are well-known in the art, Speciﬁc non-limiting
examples of the carriers and/or diluents that are useful in tie
pharmaceutical formulations of the present invention
include water and physiologically acceptable saline so u-
tions. Other pharmaceutically acceptable carriers for prepar-
ing a composition for administration to an individual
include, for example, solvents or vehicles such as glycols,
glycerol, or injectable organic esters. A pharmaceutica ly
acceptable carrier can contain physiologically acceptable
compounds that act, for example, to stabilize or to increase
the absorption of the shRNA encoding vector. Other physi-
ologically acceptable carriers include, for example, carbo-
hydrates, such as glucose, sucrose or dextrans, antioxidants,
such as ascorbic acid or glumthione, chelating agents, low
molecular weight proteins or other stabilizers or excipients,
saline, dextrose solutions, fructose solutions, ethanol, or oils
of animal, vegetative or synthetic origin. The carrier can also
contain other ingredients, for example, preservatives.
[0118] It will be recognized that the choice of a phanna-
ceutically acceptable carrier, including a physiologically
acceptable compound, depends, for example, on the route of
administration of the composition. The composition con-
taining the vectors can also contain a second reagent such as
a diagnostic reagent, nutritional substance, toxin, or addi-
tional therapeutic agent. Many agents useful in the treatment
of cardiac disease are known in the art and are envisioned for
use in conjunction with the vectors of this invention.
[0119] Formulations of vectors with cationic lipids can be
used to facilitate transfection of the vectors into cells. For
example, cationic lipids, such as lipofectin, cationic glycerol
derivatives, and polycationic molecules, such as polylysine,
can be used. Suitable lipids include, for example, Oligo-
fectamine and Lipofectamine (Life Technologies), which
can be used according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

[0120] Suitable amounts of vector must be introduced and
these amounts can be empirically determined using standard
methods. Typically, effective concentrations of individual
vector species in the environment of a cell will be about 50
nanomolar or less 10 nanomolar or less, or compositions in
which concentrations of about 1 nanomolar or less can be
used. In other aspects, the methods utilize a concentration of
about 200 picomolar or less and even a concentration of
about 50 picomolar or less can be used in many circum-
stances. One of skill in the art can determine the effective
concentration for any particular mammalian subject using
standard methods.

[0121] The shRNA is preferably administered in a thera-
peutically eﬁeetive amount, The actual amount adminis-
tered, and the rate and time-course of administration, will
depend on the nature and severity of the condition, disease

 

Jan. 3], 2019

or disorder being treated. Prescription of treatment, for
example, decisions on dosage, timing, etc., is within the
responsibility of general practitioners or specialists, and
typically takes account of the disorder, condition or disease
to be treated, the condition of the individual mammalian
subject, the site of delivery, the method of administration
and other factors known to practitioners. Examples of tech-
niques and protocols can be found in Remington’s Pharma-
ceutical Sciences 18th Ed, (1990, Mack Publishing Co.,
Easton, Pa)

[0122] Alternatively, targeting therapies can be used to
deliver the shRNA encoding vectors more speciﬁcally to
certain types of cell, by the use of targeting systems such as
antibodies or cell speciﬁc 1i gands. Targeting can be desirable
for a variety of reasons, e.g,, if the agent is unacceptably
toxic, or if it would otherwise require too high a dosage, or
if it would not otherwise be able to enter the target cells.
[0123] shRNA: Gene Therapy

[0124] shRNA can also be delivered into mammalian
cells, particularly human cells, by a gene therapy approach,
using a DNA vector from which shRNA compounds in, eg,
small hairpin form (shRNA), can be transcribed directly.
Recent studies have demonstrated that while double-
stranded shRNAs are very effective at mediating RNAi,
short, single-stranded, hairpin-shaped RNAs can also medi-
ate RNAi, presumably because they fold into intramolecular
duplexes that are processed into double-stranded shRNAs by
cellular enzymes, This discovery has signiﬁcant and far-
reaching implications, since the production of such shRNAs
can be readily achieved in vivo by transfecting cells or
tissues with DNA vectors bearing short inverted repeats
separated by a small number of (e.g., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
nucleotides that direct the transcription of such small hairpin
RNAs, Additionally, if mechanisms are included to direct
the integration of the vector or a vector segment into the
host-cell genome, or to ensure the stability of the transcrip-
tion vector, the RNAi caused by the encoded shRNAs, can
be made stable and heritable. Not only have such techniques
been used to “knock down” the expression of speciﬁc genes
in mammalian cells, but they have now been successfully
employed to knock down the expression of exogenously
expressed transgenes, as well as endogenous genes in the
brain and liver of living mice.

[0125] Gene therapy is canied out according to generally
accepted methods as are known in the art. See, for example,
US, Pat, Nos. 5,837,492 and 5,800,998 and references cited
therein. Vectors in the context of gene therapy are meant to
include those polynucleotide sequences containing
sequences sufﬁcient to express a polynucleotide encoded
therein. If the polynucleotide encodes an shRNA. expression
will produce the antisense polynucleotide sequence. Thus, in
this context, expression does not require that a protein
product be synthesized. In addition to the shRNA encoded in
the vector, the vector also contains a promoter functional in
eukaryotic cells. The shRNA sequence is under control of
this promoter Suitable eukaryotic promoters include those
described elsewhere herein and as are known in the art. The
expression vector may also include sequences, such as
selectable markers, reporter genes and other regulatory
sequences conventionally used,

[0126] Accordingly, the amount of shRNA generated in
situ is regulated by controlling such factors as the nature of
the promoter used to direct transcription of the nucleic acid
sequence, (i.e., whether the promoter is constitutive or
regulatable, strong or weak) and the number of copies of the
US 2019/0032058 A1

[0046] Additionally, the phrase “small hairpin RN ” and
the term “shRNA” include nucleic acids that also contain
moieties other than ribonucleotide moieties, including, but
not limited to, modiﬁed nucleotides, modiﬁed intemucle-
otide linkages, non-nucleotides, deoxynucleotides and ana-
logs of the nucleotides mentioned thereof.

[0047] Additionally, the term “L shRNA” refers to an
shRNA comprising a sense sequence that is connected
through a loop to the 3' end of the antisense.

[0048] Additionally, the term “R shRNA” refers to an
shRNA molecule comprising an antisense sequence that is
connected through a loop to the 3' end of the sense sequence.
[0049] The phrase “antisense sequence”, as used herein,
refers to a polynucleotide or region of a polynucleotide that
is substantially complementary (e.g., 80% or more) or 100%
complementary to a target nucleic acid of interest. An
antisense sequence can be composed of a polynucleotide
region that is RNA, DNA or chimeric RNA/DNA. Any
nucleotide within an antisense sequence can be modiﬁed by
including substituents coupled thereto, such as in a 2'
modiﬁcation. The antisense sequence can also be modiﬁed
with a diverse group of small molecules and/or conjugates.
For example, an antisense sequence may be complementary,
in whole or in part, to a molecule of messenger RNA, an
RNA sequence that is not mRNA (eg, tRNA, rRNA,
hnRNA, negative and positive stranded viral RNA and its
complementary RNA) or a sequence of DNA that is either
coding or non-coding.

[0050] The phrase “sense sequence”, as used herein, refers
to a polynucleotide or region that has the same nucleotide
sequence, in whole or in part, as a target nucleic acid such
as a messenger RNA or a sequence of DNA. When a
sequence is provided, by convention, unless otherwise indi-
cated, it is the sense sequence (or region), and the presence
of the complementary antisense sequence (or region) is
implicit.

[0051] The term “complementary”, as used herein, refers
to the ability of polynucleotides to form base pairs with one
another, Base pairs are typically formed by hydrogen bonds
between nucleotide units in antiparallel polynucleotide
strands or regions. Complementary polynucleotide strands
or regions can base pair in the Watson-Crick mamier (eg,
A to T, A to U, C to G), or in any other manner that allows
for the formation of stable duplexes.

[0052] “Perfect complementarity” or “100% complemen-
tarity", as used herein, refers to the situation in which each
nucleotide unit of one polynucleotide strand or region can
hydrogen bond with each nucleotide unit of a second poly-
nucleotide strand or region. Less than perfect complemen-
tarity refers to the situation in which some, but not all,
nucleotide units of two strands or two regions can hydrogen
bond with each other. For example, for two 19-mers, if 17
base pairs on each strand or each region can hydrogen bond
with each other, the polynucleotide strands exhibit 89.5%
complementarity. Substantial complementarity refers to
polynucleotide strands or regions exhibiting about 80% or
greater complementarity.

[0053] The term “deoxynucleotide”, as used herein, refers
to a nucleotide or polynucleotide lacking an OH group at the
2' or 3' position of a sugar moiety with appropriate bonding
and/or 2', 3' terminal dideoxy, instead having a hydrogen
bonded to the 2' and/or 3‘ carbon.

[0054] The terms “deoxyribonucleotide” and “DNA”, as
used herein, refer to a nucleotide or polynucleotide com-

Jan. 31, 2019

prising at least one ribosyl moiety that has an H at its 2'
position of a ribosyl moiety instead of an OH.

[0055] In some embodiments, an shRNA described herein
optionally includes at least one conjugate moiety.

[0056] The term “alkyl”, as used herein, refers to a hydro-
carbyl moiety that can be saturated or unsaturated, and
substituted or unsubstituted. It may comprise moieties that
are linear, branched, cyclic and/or heterocyclic, and contain
functional groups such as ethers, ketones, aldehydes, car-
boxylates, etc. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, alkyl groups are
not cyclic, heterocyclic, or comprise functional groups.
[0057] Exemplary al (yl groups include, but are not limited
to, substituted and unsubstituted groups of methyl, ethyl,
propyl, butyl, pentyl, hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl,
undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexade-
cyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, nonadecyl, eicoyl and alkyl
groups of higher numaer of carbons, as well as 2-methyl-
propyl, 2-methyl-4-ethylbutyl, 2,4-diethylpropyl, 3-propyl-
butyl, 2,8-dibutyldecy , 6,6-dimethyloctyl, 6-propyl-6-buty-
loctyl, 2-methylbutyl, 2-methylpentyl, 3-methylpentyl, and
2-ethylhexy1. The term alkyl also encompasses alkenyl
groups, such as viny , allyl, aralkyl and alkynyl groups.
Unless otherwise speciﬁed, alkyl groups are not substituted,
[0058] Substitutions within an alkyl group, when speciﬁed
as present, can include any atom or group that can be
tolerated in the alkyl moiety, including but not limited to
halogens, sulﬁJrs, thio s, thioethers, thioesters, amines (pri-
mary, secondary, or tertiary), amides, ethers, esters, alcohols
and oxygen. The alky groups can by way of example also
comprise modiﬁcations such as azo groups, keto groups,
aldehyde groups, carboxyl groups, nitro, nitroso or nitrile
groups, heterocycles such as imidazole, hydrazine or
hydroxylamino groups, isocyanate or cyanate groups, and
sulfur containing grou s such as sulfoxide, sulfone, sulﬁde,
and disulﬁde. Unless otherwise speciﬁed, alkyl groups do
not comprise halogens, sulfurs, thiols, thioeﬂiers, thioesters,
amines, amides, ethers, esters, alcohols, oxygen, or the
modiﬁcations listed above.

[0059] Further, alkyl groups may also contain hetero sub-
stitutions, which are substitutions of carbon atoms, by for
example, nitrogen, oxygen or sulfur. Heterocyclic substitu-
tions refer to alkyl rings having one or more heteroatoms.
Examples of heterocyclic moieties include but are not lim-
ited to morpholino, imidazole, and pyrrolidino. Unless oth-
erwise speciﬁed, alkyl groups do not contain hetero substi-
tutions or alkyl rings with one or more heteroatoms (i.e.,
heterocyclic substitutions).

[0060] The preferred alkyl group for a 2' modiﬁcation is a
methyl group with an O-linkage to the 2' carbon of a ribosyl
moiety, i.e., a 2'O-alkyl that comprises a 2'—O-methy1 group.
[0061] The phrase “2'-O—alkyl modiﬁed nucleotide”, as
used herein, refers to a nucleotide unit having a sugar
moiety, for example a deoxyribosyl moiety that is modiﬁed
at the 2' position such that an oxygen atom is attached both
to the carbon atom located at the 2‘ position of the sugar and
to an alkyl group, In various embodiments, the alkyl moiety
consists essentially of carbons and hydrogens, Aparticularly
preferred embodiment is one wherein the alkyl moiety is
methyl.

[0062] As used herein, the term “2' carbon modiﬁcation”
refers to a nucleotide unit having a sugar moiety, for
example a moiety that is modiﬁed at the 2‘ position of the
sugar subunit. A “2'—O-a1kyl modiﬁed nucleotide” is modi-
ﬁed at this position such that an oxygen atom is attached
US 2019/0032058 A1

for any of a variety of purposes, including 3‘ cap structures
(e.g., an inverted deoxythymidine), detectable labels conju-
gated to one or more positions in the shRNA (e.g., ﬂuores-
cent labels, mass labels, radioactive labels, etc), or other
conjugates that can enhance delivery, detection. function,
speciﬁcity, or stability (egi, amino acids, peptides, proteins,
sugars, carbohydrates, lipids, polymers, nucleotides, poly-
nucleotides, etc). Combinations of additional chemical
modiﬁcations may be employed as desired by the user.
[0091] Suitable NOX2 shRNAs include those nucleic
acids ranging from about 20 nucleotides to about 80 nucleo-
tides in length, wherein a portion of the nucleic acids have
a double-stranded structural domain ranging from about 15
nucleotides to about 25 nucleotides in length. In some
aspects, the shRNA can include modiﬁed bases or phos-
phodiester backbones to impart stability ofthe shRNA inside
tissues and cells. An exemplary NOX2 shRNA includes
SEQ ID N011 presented in Table 1.

[0092] shRNA: Synthesis

[0093] As is generally known in the art, contmonly used
oligonucleotides are oligomers or polymers of ribonucleic
acid or deoxyribonucleic acid having a combination of
naturally-occurring purine and pyrimidine bases, sugars and
covalent linkages between nucleosides including a phos-
phate group in a phosphodiester linkage However, it is
noted that the term “oligonucleotides” also encompasses
various non-naturally occuning mimetics and derivatives,
i.e., modiﬁed forms, of naturally occurring oligonucleotides,
as described herein,

[0094] shRNA molecules of the invention can be prepared
by any method known in the art for the synthesis of DNA
and RNA molecules. These include techniques for chemi-
cally synthesizing oligodeoxy-ribonucleotides and oligo-
ribonucleotides well known in the art such as for example
solid phase phosphoramidite chemical synthesis. Alterna-
tively, RNA molecules can be generated by in vitro and in
vivo transcription of DNA sequences encoding the antisense
RNA molecule. Such DNA sequences may be incorporated
into a wide variety of vectors that incorporate suitable RNA
polymerase promoters such as the T7 or SP6 polymerase
promoters. Alternatively, antisense cDNA constructs that
synthesize antisense RNA constitutively or inducibly,
depending on the promoter used, can be introduced stably
into cell lines.

[0095] shRNA molecules can be chemically synthesized
using appropriately protected ribonucleoside phosphoramid-
ites and a conventional DNA/RNA synthesizer. Custom
shRNA synthesis services are available from commercial
vendors such as Ambion (Austin, Tex., USA) and Dharma-
con Research (Lafayette, Colo., USA). See, for example,
US. Pat. No. 7,410.944.

[0096] Various well-known modiﬁcations to the DNA
molecules can be introduced as a means of increasing
intracellular stability and half-life, Possible modiﬁcations
include, but are not limited to, the addition of ﬂanking
sequences of ribo- or deoxy-nucleotides to the 5' and/or 3‘

Jan. 31, 2019

ends of the molecule or the use of phosphorothioate or
Z‘O-methyl rather than phosphodiesterase linkages within
the oligodeoxyribonucleotide backbone. An antisense
nucleic acid of the invention can be constructed using
chemical synthesis or enzymatic ligation reactions using
procedures known in the art. An antisense oligonucleotide
can be chemically synthesized using naturally-occurring
nucleotides or variously modiﬁed nucleotides designed to
increase the biological stability of the molecules or to
increase the physical stability of the duplex formed between
the antisense and sense nucleic acids (e.g., phosphorothioate
derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides can be
used).

[0097] The shRNA molecules of the invention can be
various modiﬁed equivalents of the structures of any NOX2
shRNA. A “modiﬁed equivalent” means a modiﬁed form of
a particular shRNA molecule having the same target-speci-
ﬁcity (i.e., recognizing the same mRNA molecules that
complement the unmodiﬁed particular shRNA molecule),
Thus, a modiﬁed equivalent of an unmodiﬁed shRNA mol-
ecule can have modiﬁed ribonucleotides, that is, ribonucle-
otides that contain a modiﬁcation in the chemical structure
of an unmodiﬁed nucleotide base, sugar and/or phosphate
(or phosphodiester linkage). See, for example, US. Pat. No.
7,410,944.

[0098] Preferably, modiﬁed shRNA molecules contain
modiﬁed backbones or non-natural internucleoside linkages,
e.g,, modiﬁed phosphorous-containing backbones and non-
phosphorous backbones such as morpholino backbones;
siloxane, sulﬁde, sulfoxide, sulfone, sulfonate, sulfonamide,
and sulfamate backbones; formacetyl and thioformacetyl
backbones; alkene-containing backbones; methyleneimino
and methylenehydrazino backbones; amide backbones, and
the like. See, for example, US. Pat. No. 7,410,944.
[0099] Examples of modiﬁed phosphorous-containing
backbones include, but are not limited to phosphorothioates,
phosphorodithioates, chiral phosphorothioates, phosphotri-
esters, aminoalkylphosphotriesters, alkyl phosphonates,
thionoalkylphosphonates, phosphinates, phosphoramidates,
thionophosphoramidates, thionoalkylphosphotriesters, and
boranophosphates and various salt forms thereof. See, for
example, US, Pat, No. 7,410,944.

[0100] Examples of the non-phosphorous containing
backbones described above are known in the art, e.g., US,
Pat, No. 5,677,439, each of which is herein incorporated by
reference. See, for example, US. Pat. No, 7,410,944,

[0101] Modiﬁed forms of shRNA compounds can also
contain modiﬁed nucleosides (nucleoside analogs), i.e.,
modiﬁed purine or pyrimidine bases, e.g., 5-substituted
pyrimidines, 6-azapyrimidines, pyridin-4-one, pyridin-2-
one, phenyl, pseudouracil, 2,4,6-trimethoxy benzene,
3-methyl uracil, dihydrouridine, naphthyl, aminophenyl,
5-alkylcytidines (erg, 5-methylcytidine), 5-alkyluridines
(erg, ribothymidine), 5-halouridine (e.g., S-bromouridine)
or 6-azapyrimidines or 6-alkylpyrimidines (e.g, 6-methylu-
ridine), 2-thiouridine, 4-thiouridine, 5-(carboxyhydroxy
methyl)uridine, 5‘-carboxymethylaminomethyl-Z-thiouri-
dine, 5-carboxymethylaminomethyluridine,
5-methoxyaminomethyl-2-thiourid.ine, S-methylaminom-

tein Kinase lI Triggers Atrial Fibrillation,” Circulation 2013;
128: 1748-57). CaMKII has also been shown to modulate the
gating of NaVl.5, at least in part by phosphorylation of
NaVl.5 at multiple sites (Ashpole N M, Herren A W,
Ginsburg K S et al. “Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein
kinase II (CaMKII) regulates cardiac sodium channel
NaVl.5 gating by multiple phosphorylation sites,” J Biol
Chem 2012; 287:19856-69). A recent study demonstrates a
fundamental requirement for targeting of CaMKlI to a
controlling phosphorylation site, 8571, on Nay] .5 (Hund T
J, Koval O M, Li J et al. “A beta(IV)—spectrin/CaI\/1KII
signaling complex is essential for membrane excitability in
mice,” J. Clin. Invest 2010; 120:3508-19).

[0011] CaMKII phosphorylation of NaVl.5 is thought to
decrease transient IN“, but increase INaJam, again thereby
contributing to the genesis of triggered activity (Hashamb-
hoyY L, Winslow R L, Greenstein J L, “CaMKII-dependent
activation of late INa contributes to cellular arrhythmia in a
model of the cardiac myocyte,” Carngroc, IEEE Eng Med
Biol Soc. 2011; 2011:4665-8) Modeling studies also sug-
gest that ox-CaMKII may create substrate for reentry by
regulating conduction characteristics of the myocardium
(Hashambhoy et al. (2011) supra; Christensen M D, Dun W,
Boyden P A, Anderson M E, Mohler P J, Hund T J.
“Oxidized calmodulin kinase 11 regulates conduction fol-
lowing myocardial infarction: a computational analysis,”
PLoS Comput. Biol 2009; 51e1000583), with this substrate
thought to be at least partially mediated by modulation of

IN“.
[0012] A summary of the various mechanisms for reactive
oxygen species production, oxidative stress generation, and

development of ﬁbrosis and atrial ﬁbrillation is illustrated in
FIG, 1.

SUMMARY

[0013] In a ﬁrst respect, a method of inhibiting oxidative
stress in a subject having atrial or ventricular arrhythmias,
ventricular failure or heart failure is provided. The method
includes the step of administering an effective amount of a
NOX2 inhibitor agent to the subject, wherein said admin-
istering is under conditions such that a level of oxidative
stress in myocardial tissue is reduced or eliminated.

[0014] In a second respect, a method of treating a subject
having atrial or ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular failure
or heart failure is provided. The method includes the step of
administering an eﬁective amount of a NOX2 inhibitor
agent to the subject, wherein said administering is under
conditions such that a level of atrial or ventricular arrhyth-
mias is reduced or eliminated.

[0015] In a third respect, a pharmaceutical composition for
inhibiting oxidative stress in a subject having atrial or
ventricular arrhythmias, ventricular failure or heart failure is
provided. The phamiaceutical composition includes an iso-
lated nucleic acid encoding a small hairpin RNA against
NOX2 mRNA (NOX2 thNA).

[0016] These and other features, objects and advantages of
the present invention will become better understood from
the description that follows, In the description, reference is
made to the accompanying drawings, which form a part
hereof and in which there is shown by way of illustration,
not limitation, embodiments of the invention.

ing the PVs (Chou C C, Nihei M, Zhou S et a1. “Intracellular
calcium dynamics and anisotropic reentry in isolated canine
pulmonary veins and left atrium,” Circulation 2005; 111:
2889-97). In HF, a number of atrial ion-channel and E-C
coupling proteins (Li D, Melnyk P, Feng J et al, “Effects of
Experimental Heart Failure on Atrial Cellular and Ionic
Electrophysiology,” Circulation 2000; 101:2631-8. 61, Yeh

malities Underlying Atrial Arrhythmogenesis and Contrac-
tile Dysfunction in Dogs With Congestive Heart Failure,”
Circ, Arrhythm. Electrophysiol. 2008; 1193-102) can be
modulated by ROS (Hool L C, “Reactive Oxygen Species in
Cardiac Signalling: From Mitochondria to Plasma Mem-
brane Ion Channels,” Clin, Exp, Pharm. Phys. 2006; 33: 146-
51; Zima A V, Blatter L A. “Redox regulation of cardiac
calcium channels and transporters,” Cardiovasc. Res. 2006;

“Nitric Oxide/Reactive Oxygen Species Generation and
Nitroso/Redox Imbalance in Heart Failure: From Molecular
Mechanisms to Therapeutic Implications,” Antioxidants &
Redox Signaling 2011; 142289-331) at least in part via ROS
activation of kinases and inactivation of phosphatases,
resulting in aberrant phosphorylation (e.g. of RyR2 and
phospholamban). Also, ROS directly decrease SERCA func-
tion, but increase NCX function (Kuster G M, Lancel S,
Zhang J et al, “Redox-mediated reciprocal regulation of
SERCA and Na*-Ca2* exchanger contributes to sarcoplas-
mic reticulum Ca“ depletion in cardiac myocytes,” Free
Rad Biol. Med, 2010; 48:1182-7) which parallels the
changes in SERCA and NCX in HF. Additionally, ROS
increases late/persistent IN, (1M, late) (Luo A, Ma J, Zhang
P, Zhou H, Wang W, “Sodium Channel Gating Modes
During Redox Reaction,” Cell. Phys. Bioch, 2007; 1929-20),
which again parallels that in HF (Valdivia C R, Chu W W,
Pu .I et al. “Increased late sodium current in myocytes from
a canine heart failure model and from failing human heart,”
J, Mol. Cell. Cardiol. 2005; 38:475-83) and IN“, late can
signiﬁcantly contribute to the induction of EADs and DADS
(Li D, Melnyk P, Feng J et al. “Effects of Experimental Heart
Failure on Atrial Cellular and Ionic Electrophysiology,”
Circulation 2000; 101:2631-8; Song Y, Shryock J C, Belar-
dinelli L. “An increase of late sodium current induces

heart failure,” J. Physio], Sci. 2010; 60:245-57) both in
ventricles and atria, Additional promotion of triggered activ-
ity could come from the increased Ca2+ sensitivity of
hyperphosphorylated RyR2s in HF (Terentyev D, Gyorke I,
Belevych A E et al. “Redox Modiﬁcation of Ryanodine

Receptors Contributes to Sarcoplasmic Reticulum Ca2+
Leak in Chronic Heart Failure,” Circ. Res. 2008; 103:1466-
72), which together with OS modiﬁcations of RyR2 (nitrosy-
lation, oxidation) (Valdivia C R, Chu W W, Pu .I et al
“Increased late sodium current in myocytes from a canine
heart failure model and from failing human heart,” J, Mol,

ity in atrial myocytes,” Am. J. Physio]. Heart Circ, Physio],

(Gonzalez D R, Beigi F, Treuer A V, Hare J M, “Deﬁcient

reticulum calcium lwk and arrhythmogenesis in cardiomyo-
cytes,” Proc, Natl, Acad, Sci. USA. 2007; 104:20612-7;
Marx S 0, Marks A R. “Dysfunctional ryanodine receptors
in the heart: new insights into complex cardiovascular
diseases,” J. Mol. Cell, Cardiol, 2013; 58:225-31). The
oxidation/nitrosylation state of atrial RyR2s in HF has not
been fully scrutinized; however, there appear to be signiﬁ-
cant dilferences in atrial versus ventricular E-C coupling, as
has previously been suggested by others (Bootman M D,
Smyrnias I, Thul R, Coombes S, Roderick H L, “Atrial
cardiomyocyte calcium signaling,” Biochim. Biophys, Acta
2011; 1813:922-34). The majority ofthe studies mentioned
above have been performed in isolated myocytes; the spe-
ciﬁc contribution oxidized IN“, RyR2 to the electrophysi-
ological characteristics of the intact atriumiand how this
contributes to arrhythmogenesisiis not known,

[0010] Excessively activated CaMKII is implicated in the
genesis of HF and arrhythmias, Recent evidence suggests
that both CaMKII and 11202 increase RyR2 (Marx S 0,

in the regulatory domain of CaMKII transforms CaMKII
into a constitutively active form (ox-CaMKII), leading to
aberrant phosphorylation of multiple E-C coupling proteins

(sometimes referred to as ﬁrst and second regions, as noted
above), which together form a hairpin loop stnicture Pref-
erably, the antisense and sense sequences are substantial y
complementary to one other (about 80% complementary or
more), where in certain embodiments the antisense and
sense sequences are 100% complementary to each other n
certain embodiments, the antisense and sense sequences are
too short to be processed by Dicer, and hence act through an
alternative pathway to that of longer double»stranded RNAs
(e.g,, shRNAs having antisense and sense sequences of
about 16 to about 22 nucleotides in length, e.g,, between 8
and 19 nucleotides in length (e,g,, an sshRNA). Additional y,
the antisense and sense sequences within a unimolecu ar
RNA of the invention can be the same length, or differ in
length by less than about 9 bases The loop can be any
length, with the preferred length being from 0 to 4 nucleo-
tides in length or an equivalent length of non-nucleoticic
linker, and more preferably 2 nucleotides or an equivalent
length of non-nucleotidic linker (e.g., a non-nucleotide loop
having a length equivalent to 2 nucleotides), In one emboc '-
ment, the loop is: 5'-UU-3‘ (rUrU) or 5'-tt-3‘, where “t”
represents deoxythymidine (deT), Within any shRNA hair-
pin, a plurality of the nucleotides are ribonucleotides, In tie
case of a loop of zero nucleotides, the antisense sequence is
linked directly to the sense sequence, with part of one or
both strands forming the loop. In a preferred embodiment of
a zero-nt loop shRNA, the antisense sequence is about 18 or
19 nt and the sense sequence is shorter than the antisense
sequence, so that one end of the antisense sequence forms
the loop.

 

[0082] A hairpin of representative shRNA’s can be orga-
nized in either a left-handed (L) hairpin (i.e,, 5'-antisense-
loop-sense-3‘) or a right-handed (R) hairpin (i,e., 5'-sense-
loop-antisense-3'), Furthermore, an shRNA may also contain
overhangs at either the 5' or 3' end of either the sense
sequence or the antisense sequence, depending upon the
organization of the hairpin. Preferably, if there are any
overhangs, they are on the 3' end of the hairpin and comprise
between 1 to 6 bases. The presence of an overhang is
preferred for R-type hairpins, in which case a 2-nt overhang
is preferred, and a UU or t1 overhang is most preferred,

[0083] Modiﬁcations can be added to enhance shRNA
stability, functionality, and/or speciﬁcity and to minimize
irnmunostirnulatory properties. For example, the overhangs
can be unmodiﬁed, or can contain one or more speciﬁcity or
stabilizing modiﬁcations, such as a halogen or O-alkyl
modiﬁcation of the 2‘ position, or internucleotide modiﬁca-
tions such as phosphorothioate modiﬁcation. The overhangs
can be ribonucleic acid, deoxyribonucleic acid, or a combi-
nation of ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic acid.

[0084] In another non-limiting example of modiﬁcations
that can be applied to left handed hairpins, 2'-O-methyl
modiﬁcations (or other 2' modiﬁcations, including but not
limited to other 2'-O-alkyl modiﬁcations) can be added to
nucleotides at position 15, 17, or 19 from the 5‘ antisense
terminus of the hairpin, or any two of those positions, or all
three, as well as to the loop nucleotides and to every other
nucleotide of the sense sequence except for nucleotides 9, 10
and 11 from the 5‘-most nucleotide of the sense sequence
(also called the 9.sup,th, 10.sup,th, and ll,sup,th nucleo-
tides), which should have no modiﬁcations that block “slic-
ing” activity. Any single modiﬁcation or group of modiﬁ-

Jan. 31, 2019

cations described in the preceding sentence can be used
alone or in combination with any other modiﬁcation or
group of modiﬁcations cited.

[0085] Ui-Tei, K. et al, (Nucl, Acids Res, (2008) 36 (22):
7100-7109) observed that the speciﬁcity of siRNAs can be
increased by modifying the seed region of one or both
strands, Such modiﬁcations are applicable to shRNA’s of
the present disclosure. In another non-limiting example of
modiﬁcations that can be applied to hairpins, nt 1-6 of the
antisense sequence and nt 14-19 of the sense sequence can
be 2'—O-methylated to reduce otf-target etfects. In a preferred
embodiment, only nt 1-6 are modiﬁed from 2‘-OH to 2'-H or
2'-O-alky,

[0086] As the sense sequence of an shRNA can potentially
enter RISC and compete with the antisense (targeting)
strand, modiﬁcations that prevent sense sequence phospho-
rylation are valuable in minimizing off-target signatures.
Thus, desirable chemical modiﬁcations that prevent phos-
phorylation of the 5' carbon of the 5‘-most nucleotide of
right-handed shRNA of the invention can include, but are
not limited to, modiﬁcations that: (1) add a blocking group
(e.g., a 5‘-O-alkyl) to the 5' carbon; or (2) remove the
5‘-hydroxyl group (e.g., 5‘-deoxy nucleotides) (see, e,g., WO
2005/078094).

[0087] In addition to modiﬁcations that enhance speciﬁc-
ity, modiﬁcations that enhance stability can also be added. In
one embodiment, modiﬁcations comprising 2'-O-alkyl
groups (or other 2' modiﬁcations) can be added to one or
more, and preferably all, pyrimidines (e.g,, C and/or U
nucleotides) of the sense sequence. Modiﬁcations such as 2'
F or 2'-O-alkyl of some or all of the Cs and Us of the sense
sequence/region, respectively, or the loop structure, can
enhance the stability of the shRNA molecules without
appreciably altering target speciﬁc silencing. It should be
noted that while these modiﬁcations enhance stability, it may
be desirable to avoid the addition of these modiﬁcation
patterns to key positions in the hairpin in order to avoid
disruption of RNAi (e.g., that interfere with “slicing" activ-
ity),

[0088] Additional stabilization modiﬁcations to the phos-
phate backbone may be included in the shRNAs in some
embodiments of the present invention. For example, at least
one phosphorothioate, phosphordithioate, and/or methyl-
phosphonate may be substituted for the phosphate group at
some or all 3' positions of nucleotides in the shRNA
backbone, or any particular subset of nucleotides (e.g., any
or all pyrimidines in the sense sequence of the oligonucle-
otide backbone), as well as in any overhangs, and/or loop
structures present. These modiﬁcations may be used inde-
pendently or in combination with the other modiﬁcations
disclosed herein.

porated herein by reference in their entirety: Q. Ge, H. Eves,

to be “operably linked to” a DNA sequence that codes for an
RNA (“an RNA coding sequence” or “shRNA encoding
sequence”) or a polypeptide if the two sequences are situated
such that the regulatory DNA sequence affects expression of
the coding DNA sequence (i,e., that the coding sequence or
functional RNA is under the transcriptional control of the
promoter), Coding sequences can be operably-linked to
regulatory sequences in sense or antisense orientation. An
RNA coding sequence refers to a nucleic acid that can serve
as a template for synthesis of an RNA molecule such as an
shRNA. Preferably, the RNA coding region is a DNA
sequence,

[0073] As used herein, the term “promoter" refers to a
nucleotide sequence, usually upstream (5') to its coding
sequence, which directs and/or controls the expression of the
coding sequence by providing the recognition for RNA
polymerase and other factors required for proper transcrip-
tion. “Promoter” includes a minimal promoter that is a short
DNA sequence comprised of a TATA-box and other
sequences that serve to specify the site of transcription
initiation, to which regulatory elements are added for control
of expression. “Promoter” also refers to a nucleotide
sequence that includes a minimal promoter plus regulatory
elements that is capable of controlling the expression of a
coding sequence or functional RNA, This type of promoter
sequence consists of proximal and more distal upstream
elements, the latter elements often referred to as enhancers,
Accordingly, an “enhancer” is a DNA sequence that stimu-
lates promoter activity and may be an innate element of the
promoter or a heterologous element inserted to enhance the
level or tissue speciﬁcity of a promoter. It is capable of
operating in both orientations (sense or antisense), and is
capable of functioning even when moved either upstream or
downstream from the promoterl Both enhancers and other
upstream promoter elements bind sequence-speciﬁc DNA-
binding proteins that mediate their effects. Promoters may be
derived in their entirety from a native gene, or be composed
of different elements derived from different promoters found
in nature, or even be comprised of synthetic DNA segments.
A promoter may also contain DNA sequences that are
involved in the inding of protein factors that control the
effectiveness of transcription initiation in response to physi-
ological or developmental conditions, Any promoter known
in the art which regulates the expression of the shRNA or
RNA coding seL uence is envisioned in the practice of the
invention,
[0074] As used herein, the term “reporter element” or
“marker” is meant a polynucleotide that encodes a polypep-
tide capable 0 being detected in a screening assay.
Examples of polypeptides encoded by reporter elements
include, but are not limited to, lacZ, GFP, luciferase, and
chloramphenico acetyltransferasel See, for example, US,
Pat, No 7,416,849. Many reporter elements and marker
genes are known in the art and envisioned for use in the
inventions disclosed herein.

[0075] As usec herein, the term “RNA transcript” refers to
the product resulting from RNA polymerase catalyzed tran-
scription of a DNA sequence, “Messenger RNA transcript
(mRNA)" refers to the RNA that is without introns and that
can be translated into protein by the cell.

[0076] As usec herein, the term “shRN ” (small hairpin
RNA) refers to an RNA duplex wherein a portion of the
RNA is part of a hairpin structure (shRNA). In addition to

duplex. The loop can vary in length. In some embodiments
the loop is 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 or 13 nucleotides in length.
The hairpin structure can also contain 3' or 5' overhang
portions. In some aspects, the overhang is a 3‘ or a 5'
overhang 0, l, 2, 3, 4 or 5 nucleotides in length. In one
aspect of this invention, a nucleotide sequence in the vector
serves as a template for the expression of a small hairpin
RNA, comprising a sense region, a loop region and an
antisense region. Following expression the sense and anti-
sense regions forrn a duplex. It is this duplex, forming the
shRNA, which hybridizes to, for example, the NOX2
mRNA and reduces expression of NADPH oxidase, lower-
ing ROS and oxidative stress levels, ﬁbrosis and AF,
[0077] As used herein, the term “knock-down” or “knock-
down technology” refers to a technique of gene silencing in
which the expression of a target gene or gene of interest is
reduced as compared to the gene expression prior to the
introduction of the siRNA, which can lead to the inhibition
of production of the target gene product. “Double knock-
down” is the knockdown of two genes. The term “reduced”
is used herein to indicate that the target gene expression is
lowered by 0.1-100%, For example, the expression may be
reduced 05, l, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60,
65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95, or even 99%. The expression may
be reduced by any amount (%) within those intervals, such
as for example, 2-4, 11-14, 16-19, 21-24, 26-29, 31-34,
36-39, 41-44, 46-49, 51-54, 56-59, 61-64, 66-69, 71-74,
76-79, 81-84, 86-89, 91-94, 96, 97, 98 or 99. Knock-down
of gene expression can be directed by the use of shRNAs.
[0078] As used herein, the term “treating” refers to ame-
liorating at least one symptom of, curing and/or preventing
the development of a disease or disorder such as for
example, but not limited to, cardiac ﬁbrosis and AF,
[0079] As used herein, the term “vector" refers to any viral
or non-Viral vector, as well as any plasmid, cosmid, phage or
binary vector in double or single stranded linear or circular
form that may or may not be self transmissible or mobili-
zable, and that can transform prokaryotic or eukaryotic host
cells either by integration into the cellular genome or which
can exist extrachromosomally (e.g., autonomous replicating
plasmid with an origin of replication). Any vector known in
the art is envisioned for use in the practice of this invention.
[0080] The modal verb “may" refers to the preferred use
or selection of one or more options or choices among the
several described embodiments or features contained within
the same. Where no options or choices are disclosed regard-
ing a particular embodiment or feature contained in the
same, the modal verb “may” refers to an aﬁirmative act
regarding how to make or use and aspect of a described
embodiment or feature contained in the same, or a deﬁnitive
decision to use a speciﬁc skill regarding a described embodi-
ment or feature contained in the same, In this latter context,
the modal Verb “may” has the same meaning and connota-
tion as the auxiliary verb “can.”

ing the amount of NOX2 protein expressed. In some
embodiments, RNAi is utilized to inhibit NOX2 gene func-
tion. RNAi represents an evolutionary conserved cellular
defense for controlling the expression of foreign genes in
most eukaryotes, including humans, RNAi is typically trig-
gered by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) and causes
sequence-speciﬁc mRNA degradation of single-stranded tar-
get RNAs homologous in response to dsRNA. The media-

tors of mRNA degradation are small interfering RNA
duplexes (siRNAs), which are normally produced from long
dsRNA by enzymatic cleavage in the cell. siRNAs are
generally approximately twenty-one nucleotides in length
(e.g. 21-23 nucleotides in length), and have a base-paired
structure characterized by two nucleotide 3'-overhangs. F ol-
lowing the introduction of a small RNA, or RNAi, into the
cell, it is believed the sequence is delivered to an enzyme
complex called RISC (RNA-induced silencing complex).
RISC recognizes the target and cleaves it with an endonu-
clease, It is noted that if larger RNA sequences are delivered
to a cell, RNase III enzyme (Dicer) converts longer dsRNA
into 21-23 nt ds siRNA fragments.

[0148] The transfection of siRNAs into animal cells
results in the potent, long-lasting post-transcriptional silenc-
ing of speciﬁc genes (Caplen et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci
U.S.A. 2001; 98: 9742-7; Elbashir et al., Nature, 2001;
411:494-8; Elbashir et al., Genes Dev, 2001; 15: 188-200;
and Elbashir et al., EMBO J. 2001; 20: 6877-88, all ofwhich
are herein incorporated by reference), Methods and compo-
sitions for performing RNAi with siRNAs are described, for
example. in US, Pat No. 6,506,559, herein incorporated by
reference,

[0149] siRNAs are extraordinarily eﬂ'ective at lowering
the amounts of targeted RNA, and by extension proteins,
frequently to undetectable levels. The silencing effect can
last several months, and is extraordinarily speciﬁc, because
one nucleotide mismatch between the target RNA and the
central region of the siRNA is frequently sufﬁcient to
prevent silencing (Brummelkamp et al, Science 2002; 296:
550-3; and Holen et al, Nucleic Acids Res 2002; 30: 1757-
66, both of which are herein incorporated by reference).
[0150] In some embodiments, NOX2 expression is modu-
lated using antisense compounds that speciﬁcally hybridize
with one or more nucleic acids encoding NOX2, The spe-
ciﬁc hybridization of an oligomeric compound with its target
nucleic acid interferes with the normal function of the
nucleic acid. This modulation of function ot‘a target nucleic
acid by compounds that speciﬁcally hybridize to it is gen-
erally referred to as “antisense”

[0151] In some embodiments. the present invention con-
templates the use of any genetic manipulation for use in
modulating the expression of NOX2 genes. Examples of
genetic manipulation include, but are not limited to, gene
knockout (e,g., removing the NOX2 gene from the chromo-
some using, for example, recombination), expression of
antisense constructs with or without inducible promoters,
and the like. Delivery of nucleic acid construct to cells in
vitro or in vivo may be conducted using any suitable
method, A suitable method is one that introduces the nucleic
acid construct into the cell such that the desired event occurs
(e.g., expression of an antisense construct). Genetic therapy
may also be used to deliver siRNA or other interfering
molecules that are expressed in vivo (e.g., upon stimulation
by an inducible promoter.

[0152] In some embodiments, the present invention pro-
vides antibodies that target NOX2 protein. Any suitable
antibody (e.g., monoclonal, polyclonal, or synthetic) may be
utilized in the therapeutic methods disclosed herein. In
preferred embodiments, the antibodies are humanized anti-
bodies Methods for humanizing antibodies are well known
in the art (See e.g,, UISI Pat. Nos 6,180,370, 5,585,089,
6,054,297, and 5,565,332; each of which is herein incorpo-
rated by reference).

[0153] In some embodiments, the present invention pro-
vides methods of enhancing entry of a NOX2 inhibitor into
cells or tissue, In some embodiments, the present invention
provides administering a NOX2 inhibitor in conjunction
with electroporation, electropermeabilization, or sonopora-
tion, In some embodiments, the present invention provides
administering a NOX2 inhibitor in conjunction with elec-
troporation, In some embodiments, the present invention
provides co-injection/electroporation of the tissue of a sub-
ject, In some embodiments, the present invention provides
administering a NOX2 inhibitor prior to, simultaneously
with, and/or following electroporation. In some embodi-
ments, electroporation provides a method of delivering
pharmaceuticals or nucleic acids (e.g, DNA) into cells, In
some embodiments, tissue electrically stimulated at the
same time or shortly aﬁer pharmaceutical or DNA is applied
(e.g, NOX2 inhibitor), In some embodiments, electropora-
tion increases cell permeability. The permeability or the
pores are large enough to allow the pharmaceuticals and/or
DNA to gain access to the cells, In some embodiments, the
pores in the cell membrane close and the cell once again
becomes impermeable or less permeable, Devices for co-
injection/electroporation are known in the art (U ,S, Pat. No,
7,328,064, herein incorporated by reference in its entirety),

[0154] Furthermore, though the canine model utilized
PLA as model atrial tissue, the approach is applicable to all
atrial tissues, In some embodiments, the present invention
provides compositions and methods to treat or prevent
conditions and/or diseases of the heart (eg. rhythm distur-
bances (eg. atrial ﬁbrillation». In some embodiments, the
present invention provides treatment or prevention of a heart
disease or condition selected from the list of aortic dissec-
tion, cardiac arrhythmia (eg, atrial cardiac arrhythmia (e.g,
premature atrial contractions, wandering atrial pacemaker,
multifocal atrial tachycardia, atrial ﬂutter, atrial ﬁbrillation,
etc.), junctional arrhythmias (e.g. supraventricular tachycar-
dia, AV nodal reentrant tachycardia, paroxysmal supra-
Ventricular tachycardia, junctional rhythm, junctional tachy-
cardia, premature junctional complex, etc,), atrio-ventricular
arrhythmias, ventricular arrhythmias (eg, premature veri-
tricular contractions, accelerated idioventricular rhythm,
monomorphic ventricular tachycardia, polymorphic veri-
tricular tachycardia, ventricular ﬁbrillation, etc.), etc,), con-
genital heart disease, myocardial infarction, dilated cardio-
myopathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, aortic
regurgitation, aortic stenosis, mitral regurgitation, mitral
stenosis, Ellis-van Creveld syndrome, familial hypertrophic
cardiomyopathy, Holt-Orams Syndrome, Marfan Syndrome,
Ward-Romano Syndrome, and/or similar diseases and con-
ditions,

[0155] In some embodiments, the present invention pro-
vides compositions and methods to treat atrial ﬁbrillation,
Atrial ﬁbrillation is the commonest rhythm disturbance of
the heart, The posterior left atrium and pulmonary veins
have been shown to play an important role in the genesis of
atrial ﬁbrillation. More recent studies demonstrate a role for
the autonomic nervous system, especially the parasympa-
thetic nervous system, in the genesis of atrial ﬁbrillation
from the posterior left atrium. Current therapies to manage
atrial ﬁbrillation remain ineﬁective, While novel links,
including autonomic activity described here, provide for
beneﬁcial treatment options. Work conducted during the
development of embodiments of the present invention shows
that selective disruption of autonomic pathways in the

Jan. 31, 2019

posterior left atrium can signiﬁcantly modify the ability to
the heart to sustain atrial ﬁbrillation, In particular, embodi-
ments of the present invention treat atrial ﬁbrillation by
administration of NOX2 inhibitors. An understanding of the
mechanism of action is not necessary to practice the present
invention and the present invention is not limited to any
particular mechanism of action, The present invention also
provides compositions and methods for researching atrial
ﬁbrillation, including screening for compounds useful in
treating, prevent, or reducing signs or symptoms associate
with atrial ﬁbrillation.

[0157] Dog Protocols,

[0158] Purpose-bred hound dogs (weight range: 25-35 kg;
age rage: 1-3 years) used in this study were maintained in
accordance to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory
Animals published by the US, National Institutes of Health
(NIH Publication No, 85-23, revised 1996) as approved by
the Animal Care and Use Committee of Northwestern Uni-
versity. Before undergoing the procedures listed below, all
animals were sedated with diazepam 0.22 mg/kg IM and
were induced with propofol (3-7 mg/kg IV), After animals
were unresponsive, they were intubated and positive-pres-
sure ventilated, and anesthesia was maintained with isoﬂu-
rane 05-15%. The surgical ﬁeld was scrubbed with chlo-
rhexidine and isopropyl alcohol, sprayed with betadine
solution, and draped with sterile towels and sheets. The chest
was then opened via a left lateral thoracotomy,

[0159] Eleven hounds were randomized into 2 groups: 1)
control (n:7) expressing LacZ and 2) gene therapy with a
plasmid expressing NOX2 shRNA (n4). During an initial
procedure, a leﬁ lateral thoracotomy was performed and the
pericardium was incised; animals underwent invasive elec-
trophysiology study (EPS), gene injection, echocardiogram
and epicardial implantation of a leﬁ ventricular pacemaker.
Aﬁer animals were allowed to recover for 3-5 days, ven-
tricular tachypacing was initiated at 240 bpm. Clinical status
assessment and pacing was veriﬁed daily. Three weeks after
the initial procedure, animals underwent terminal echocar-
diogram, FPS and cardiac extraction for histology and
molecular studies.

[0160] Initial Open Chest Electrophysiological Mapping
[0161] Eﬁective Refractory Periods (ERPs), ERPs were
obtained using two rectangular plaques epicaridally posi-
tioned on the PLA and LAA, Each plaque had 21 electrodes
each (7x3 electrodes, inter-electrode distance:5 mm). A
Bloom stimulator interfaced with a GE Prucka Cardiolab
system (GE Healthcare, Waukesha, Wis.) were used to
perform programmed stimulation. ERPs were measured by
delivering an 8 pulse drive train at 400 ms coupled to a
premature stimulus, The coupling interval of the premature
stimulus was decreased in 10 ms increments, and the ERP
was deﬁned as the longest coupling interval that fails to
conduct. ERPs were obtained from ﬁve distributed sites in

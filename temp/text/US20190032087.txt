[0195] FIG. 33 is a schematic representation of a repre-
sentative device and method of the invention. Referring to
FIG. 33, device 3300 includes Region A, where a ﬁrst stream
comprising an polynucleic acid in a ﬁrst solvent and a
second stream comprising lipid particle-forming materials in
a second solvent are ﬂown concentrically into a channel, are
introduced into Region B where rapid mixing occurs in a
micromixer and then ultimately to Region C where we have
the ﬁnal product. The two ﬂuids in Region A may be
separated by a physical barrier or by sheath ﬂuid as dem-
onstrated in the cross sectional view,

[0196] Method for Delivering Therapeutic Agents Using
Lipid Particles

[0197] The lipid particles of the present invention may be
used to deliver a therapeutic agent to a cell, in Vitro or in
vivo. In particular embodiments, the therapeutic agent is a
nucleic acid, which is delivered to a cell using nucleic
acid-lipid particles of the present invention. The methods
and compositions may be readily adapted for the delivery of
any suitable therapeutic agent for the treatment of any
disease or disorder that would beneﬁt from such treatment
[0198] In certain embodiments, the present invention pro-
vides methods for introducing a nucleic acid into a cell.
Preferred nucleic acids for introduction into cells are siRNA,
miRNA, immune-stimulating oligonucleotides, plasmids,
antisense and ribozymes. These methods may be carried out
by contacting the particles or compositions of the present
invention with the cells for a period of time suﬁicient for
intracellular delivery to occur.

[0199] Typical applications include using well known
procedures to provide intracellular delivery of siRNA to
knock down or silence speciﬁc cellular targets. Alternatively
applications include delivery of DNA or mRNA sequences
that code for therapeutically useful polypeptides. In this
manner, therapy is provided for genetic diseases by supply-
ing deﬁcient or ab sent gene products. Methods of the present
invention may be practiced in Vitro, ex vivo, or in vivo. For
example, the compositions of the present invention can also
be used for deliver of nucleic acids to cells in vivo, using
methods which are known to those of skill in the art.
[0200] The delivery of siRNA by a lipid particle of the
invention and its eiTectiveness in silencing gene expression
is described below.

[0201] For in vivo administration, the pharmaceutical
compositions are preferably administered parenterally (e.g.,
intraarticularly, intravenously, intraperitoneally, subcutane-
ously, or intramuscularly). In particular embodiments, the
pharmaceutical compositions are administered intrave-
nously or intraperitoneally by a bolus injection Other routes
of administration include topical (skin, eyes, mucus mem-
branes), oral, pulmonary, intranasal, sublingual, rectal, and
vaginal.

[0202] In one embodiment, the present invention provides
a method of modulating the expression of a target poly-
nucleotide or polypeptide. These methods generally com-
prise contacting a cell with a lipid particle of the present
invention that is associated with a nucleic acid capable of
modulating the expression of a target polynucleotide or
polypeptide. As used herein, the term “modulating” refers to
altering the expression of a target polynucleotide or poly-
peptide. Modulating can mean increasing or enhancing, or it
can mean decreasing or reducing.

[0203] In related embodiments, the present invention pro-
vides a method of treating a disease or disorder character-

Jan. 3], 2019

ized by overexpression of a polypeptide in a subject, com-
prising providing to the subject a pharmaceutical
composition of the present invention, wherein the therapeu-
tic agent is selected from an siRNA, a microRNA, an
antisense oligonucleotide, and a plasmid capable of express-
ing an siRNA, a microRNA, or an antisense oligonucleotide,
and wherein the siRNA, microRNA, or antisense RNA
comprises a polynucleotide that speciﬁcally binds to a
polynucleotide that encodes the polypeptide, or a comple-
ment thereof.

[0204] In a further aspect, the invention provides a phar-
maceutical composition comprising a lipid particle of the
invention and a phannaceutically acceptable carrier or
diluent. Representative pharmaceutically acceptable carriers
or diluents include solutions for intravenous injection (e.g.,
saline or dextrose). The composition can take the form of a
cream, ointment, gel, suspension, or emulsion.

[0205] The following is a description of a representative
LNP system, device and method for making the LNP system,
and method for using a LNP for delivering therapeutic
agents,

[0206] Rapid microﬂuidic mixing allows production of
monodisperse lipid nanoparticles. Fomiulation of lipid
nanoparticles was performed by rapidly mixing a lipid-
ethanol solution with an aqueous buffer inside a microﬂuidic
mixer (FIG. 15B) designed to induce chaotic advection and
provide a controlled mixing environment at intermediate
Reynolds number (24<Re<240). The microﬂuidic channel
contains herringbones that generate a chaotic ﬂow by chang-
ing the orientation of heningbone structures between half
cycles, causing a periodic change in the centers of local
rotational and extensional ﬂow.

[0207] To determine mixing performance inside the
device, the pH sensitivity of ﬂuorescein was used where two
10 [1M ﬂuorescein streams were mixed, one ﬂuorescent at
pH 8.88 and the other non-ﬂuorescent at pH 5.15. The
channel length required for mixing to occur (extent of
mixing >95%) was found to be between 0.8 cm and 1.0 cm.
This resulted in mixing times of approximately 45 ms, 10
ms, and 5 ms and 3 ms for ﬂow rates of 0.1 ml/min, 0.4
ml/min, 07 ml/min and 10 ml/min, respectively. The small
difference in mixing length is expected in a chaotic ﬂow,
which grows only logarithmically with Péclet number
(Pe:Ul/D where U is the ﬂuid velocity, 1 is the cross
sectional channel length, and D is the diEusivity of the
molecule).

[0208] The following representative formulations include
an ionizable cationic lipid, DLin-KC2-DMA, having an
apparent pKa of 6.7 rendering the lipid suitable for encap-
sulation of siRNA at low pH and providing a near neutral
cationic surface charge density at physiological pH. Using
this LNP-siRNA scheme as a model system, the effect of
ﬂow rate on LNP formation was determined As the mixing
time dramatically decreases with increased ﬂow rate, the
speed at which lipids are introduced into the aqueous phase
was expected to inﬂuence their ﬁnal size and dispersity.
Using identical ﬂow rates, from 0.1 ml/min to 1 ml/min per
channel, FIG, 1613 shows the mean particle diameter of
LNP-siRNA systems produced by the microﬂuidic mixer,
The buifer contained siRNA to yield a siRNA/total lipid
ratio of 0.06 (wt/wt) and the LNP mixture was diluted
directly into buffer to reduce ethanol content to approxi-
mately 22 vol %. Particle size decreased signiﬁcantly when
increasing total ﬂow rate from 0.2 ml/min to 2 ml/min.
US 2019/0032087 A1
15

Particle size was largest under a ﬂow rate of 012 ml/min and
the LNP reached a limit size of approximately 40 nm as
determined from the number-weighted particle diameter
Alternatively, the mixing time was also adjusted by chang-
ing the ratio of the ethanol and aqueous streams, Increasing
the ﬂow rate of the aqueous stream in effect provides a
quicker dilution of the lipids with the aqueous streami With
the lipid-ethanol stream kept constant at 0.5 ml/min, an
increase in the aqueous ﬂow rate resulted in a decrease in
particle size (FIG. 16C). The substantial drop in particle
size, from about 70 nm to 35 nm, with a three-fold increase
in the aqueous ﬂow rate highlights the importance in rapidly
reducing the ethanol content

[0209] Because these LNP are expected to form sponta-
neously as the lipids encounter a more aqueous environ-
ment, it was also important to explore the effect of lipid
concentration. As lipid concentration is increased, the
amount of lipids available to incorporate into a LNP would
be expected to increase or otherwise form additional par-
ticles. This was monitored as the lipid concentration was
increased from 10 mM to 50 mM in the ethanol stream. An
increase in mean particle diameter from about 40 nm to 70
nm was observed following this increase in lipid concen-
tration (FIG, 17),

[0210] Rapid microﬂuidic mixing provides a broad for-
mulation range of LNP-siRNA systems. While recent
improvements of the cationic lipid have advanced LN'P
potency several fold, it has also become apparent that further
improvements can be provided via optimization of the LNP
composition. In particular, it can inﬂuence their bilayer-
destabilizing capacity and endosomolytic potential or may
inﬂuence their circulation behavior at physiological pH. For
example, formulations with less PEG-lipid and increased
cationic lipid have shown dramatic improvements in in vivo
eﬂicacy of LNP systems targeting liver hepatocytes, This
was observed in a recent report for a mouse Factor VII
model, which provided a further ﬁve-fold reduction in EDSO
in the optimized LNR Although the PEG-lipid is necessary
for particulate stability, it can also diminish the membrane-
destabilizing property of these LNP systems. With the
preformed vesicle (PFV) method, difﬁculties have been
encountered when attempting to produce LNP systems with
less than 5 mol % PEG-lipid; this is presumably due to less
PEG content on the exterior of the vesicles which increases
fusion between LNPs. Further, the incubation step necessary
for reorganization of preformed lipid particles and encap-
sulation of siRNA requires ethanol solutions in the range of
30% (v/v) This increased lipid ﬂuidity can promote insta-
bility and lead to additional aggregation and fusion of the
preformed lipid particles.

[0211] Using PEG-c-DMA, the ability of the microﬂuidic
(MF) method (fast mixing times and short residence prior to
dilution of the LNP below 25% ethanol (v/v)) to produce
LNP-siRNA systems with varying PEG-lipid content was
explored. An initial composition of DLin-KC2-DMA,
DSPC, cholesterol, and PEG-c-DMA (40:11.5:38.5:10 mol/
mol) was used with a siRNA/total lipid ratio of 0.06 (wt/wt).
Additional cholesterol was used to compensate for the
decreased amount of PEG-c-DMA. Titration of PEG-c-
DMA to 2 mol % led to only a minor increase in particle size
using the microﬂuidic approach. Further decrease to 1 mol
% PEG led to an increase in diameter from about 20 nm to
about 40 nm (FIG. 18A). In contrast, the mean particle
diameter using the PFV method showed a constant increase

Jan. 31, 2019

in particle diameter, from 20 nm to 70 nm, as PEG-lipid
content was decreased to 1 mol %. In addition to producing
LNP with low amounts of PEG-lipid, it is of interest to be
able to vary the amount of cationic lipid, As DLin—KCZ-
DMA was increased from 40 mol % to 70 mol %, a general
increase in particle size was observed, from about 40 nm to
70 nm, for those produced by the microﬂuidic approach
(FIG, 18B),

[0212] Self assembly in a microﬂuidic device can produce
LNP with near complete encapsulation, In producing LNP-
siRNA systems, a robust process necessarily will provide
high percent encapsulation of the OGN product. siRNA
encapsulation was evaluated by varying the siRNA/total
lipid ratio from 0.01 to 0.2 (wt/wt) using the LNP-siRNA
formulation with 1 mol % PEG, LNP formulations achieved
percent encapsulation approaching 100 percent over this
range (F IG. 19). Upon reaching a siRNA/total lipid ratio of
0.21 (wt/wt), corresponding to a charge balance between the
cationic lipid and anionic siRNA (N/P:l), encapsulation
was observed to diminish (data not shown). This later trend
was expected due to insufﬁcient cationic charge required to
complex the siRNA and encapsulate in the LNR

[0213] Morphology. LNP produced by the microﬂuidic
and preformed vesicle methods were visualized with cryo-
TEM, Particle sizes of the LNP were similar to that mea-
sured by dynamic light scat1ering. LNP-siRNA systems
containing DLin-KCZ-DMA/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-c-
DOMG at 40/11.5/47.5/ 1 mol % with siRNA-to-lipid ratio
of 0.06 wtjwt are shown in FIG, 20A. In addition, empty
LNP samples of the same composition are shown in FIG,
203 The particles produced are predominately spherical
and homogeneous in size. LNP formulated with the pre-
formed approach and of identical composition was also
imaged. These shared similar features with the microﬂuidic
LNP, though other features such as coffee-bean structures
were also observed, These LNP were also larger in size, as
expected from the dynamic light scattering results.

[0214] LN'P siRNA systems produced by microﬂuidics can
be highly potent gene silencing agents in vivo. The ability of
LNP siRNA systems to induce gene silencing in vivo
following iv. injection was investigated using the mouse
Factor VII model, Formulations containing Dlin-KCZ-
DMA/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-c-DOMG with a siRNA-to-
lipid ratio of 0.06 (w/w) were created using the microﬂuidic
approachi Administration of the LNP-siRNA was by tail
vein injection. The cationic lipid, DLin-KCZ-DMA, was
varied from 30 mol % to 60 mol % while keeping the
DSPC-to-Cholesterol ratio at 0.2 wt/wt. Increasing the cat-
ionic lipid content in the LNP resulted in a progressive
improvement in FVII silencing, The best performing LNP
contained 60 mol % DLin-KC2-DMA, resulting in an effec-
tive dose for 50% FVII silencing at about 0103 mg’kg (FIG.
21) It is interesting to note that further increase to 70 mol
% led to no observable improvement in efﬁcacy over the 60
mol % Dlin-KCZ-DMA LNP.

[0215] The results demonstrate that a microﬂuidic device
containing a staggered herringbone mixer can be used to
generate LN'P with a variety of lipid compositions, can be
used to eﬂiciently encapsulate OGN such as siRNA and that
the LNP siRNA systems produced exhibit excellent gene
silencing capabilities both in vitro and in vivo.

[0216] The microﬂuidics device and system of the inven-
tion allow for the formation of LNP and LNP containing
OGN of 100 nm size or smaller and provide OGN encap-

pure DOPC produced by the microﬂuidics procedure are
very small “limit size” vesicles in the range of 30-50 nm
diameter The vesicles have an interior with lower electron
density consistent with a bilayer shell surrounding an inner
aqueous core. Interestingly, LNP consisting of DOPE/
DOPC/PEG-lipid produced by the microﬂuidics procedure
of the invention (FIG, 34B) exhibit somewhat larger sizes
where the majority of the particles have an electron dense
inner core. This could be consistent with the formation of
solid core particles where lipids with the lowest solubility in
water (e.g,, DOPE) condense out to form nucleation points
that are subsequently coated by more polar lipids such as
DOPC and PEG-lipid, Such a process may be occurring for
the cationic lipids and cationic lipid-polynucleic acid sys-
tems in the lipid mixtures employed for polynucleic acid
entrapment

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE
INVENTION

[0085] The present invention provides lipid particles con-
taining a therapeutic agent, methods and devices for making
the lipid particles containing a therapeutic agent, and meth-
ods for delivering a therapeutic agent using the lipid par-
ticles.

[0086] Lipid Particles

[0087] In one aspect, the invention provides lipid particles
containing a therapeutic agent. The lipid particles include
one or more cationic lipids, one or more second lipids, and
one or more nucleic acids.

[0088] Cationic lipid, The lipid particles include an cat-
ionic lipid. As used herein, the term “cationic lipid” refers to
a lipid that is cationic or becomes cationic (protonated) as
the pH is lowered below the pK of the ionizable group of the
lipid, but is progressively more neutral at higher pH values.
At pH values below the pK, the lipid is then able to associate
with negatively charged nucleic acids (e,g., oligonucle-
otides), As used herein, the term “cationic lipid” includes
zwitterionic lipids that assume a positive charge on pH
decrease.

[0089] The term “cationic lipid” refers to any of a number
of lipid species which carry a net positive charge at a
selective pH, such as physiological pH. Such lipids include,
but are not limited to, N,N-dioleyl-N,N-dimethylammonium
chloride (DODAC); N-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N,N,N-
trimethylammonium chloride (DOTMA); N,N-distearyl-N,
N-dimethylammonium bromide (DDAB); N-(2,3-dioleoy-
loxy)propyl)-N,N,N-trimethylam.monium chloride
(DOTAP); 3-(N4(N',N‘-dimethylaminoethane)-carbamoyl)
cholesterol (DC-Chol) and N-(l,2-dimyristyloxyprop-3-yl)-
N,N-dimethyl-N-hydroxyethyl ammonium bromide (DM-
RIE). Additionally, a number of commercial preparations of
cationic lipids are available which can be used in the present
invention, These include, for example, LIPOFECTIN®
(commercially available cationic liposomes comprising
DOTMA and l,2-dioleoyl-sn-3-phosphoethanolamine
(DOPE), from GIBCO/BRL, Grand Island, NY); LIPO-
FECTAMINE® (commercially available cationic liposomes
comprising N-(l-(2,3-dioleyloxy)propyl)-N-(2—(spermin-
ecarboxamido)ethyl)-N,N-dimethylammonium triﬂuoroac-
etatc (DOSPA) and (DOPE), from GIBCO/BRL); and
TRAN SFECTAM® (commercially available cationic lipids
comprising dioctadecylamidoglycyl carboxysperrnine
(DOGS) in ethanol from Promega Corp., Madison, Wis.)
The following lipids are cationic and have a positive charge

Jan. 3], 2019

at below physiological pH: DODAP, DODMA, DMDMA,
l ,2-dilinoleyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopropane
(DLinDMA), l,2-dilinolenyloxy-N,N-dimethylaminopro-
pane (DLenDMA).

[0090] The lipid particle-forming materials include an
ionizable lipid. As used herein, the term “ionizable lipid"
refers to a lipid that becomes cationic (protonated) as the pH
is lowered below the pK of the ionizable group of the lipid,
but is progressively more neutral at higher pH values. At pH
values below the pK, the lipid is then able to associate with
negatively charged polynucleic acids (e.g., oligonucle-
otides), In one embodiment, the ionizable lipid is an amino
lipid,

[0091] In one embodiment, the cationic lipid is an amino
lipid, Suitable amino lipids useful in the invention include
those described in WO 2009/096558, incorporated herein by
reference in its entirety. Representative amino lipids include

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

[0003] Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) are the most clinically
advanced drug delivery systems, with seven LNP-based
drugs having received regulatory approval. These approved
drugs contain small molecules such as anticancer drugs and
exhibit improved efﬁcacy and/or reduced toxicity compared
to the “free” drug. LNP carrier technology has also been
applied to delivery of “genetic” drugs such as plasmids for
expression of therapeutic proteins or small interfering RNA
(siRNA) oligonucleotides (OGN) for silencing genes con-
tributing to disease progression. Devising methods for eﬂi-
cient in vivo delivery of siRNA OGN and other genetic
drugs is the major problem impeding the revolutionary
potential of these agents as therapeutics.

[0004] Recent advances in LNP technology and the design
of the cationic lipids required for encapsulation and delivery
of genetic drugs highlight the potential of LNP systems to
solve the in vivo delivery problem. LNP-siRNA systems
have been shown to induce silencing of therapeutically
relevant target genes in animal models, including non-
human primates following intravenous (i.v.) injection and
are currently under evaluation in several clinical trials.
[0005] A variety of methods have been developed to
formulate LNP systems containing genetic drugs. These
methods include mixing preformed LNP with OGN in the
presence of ethanol or mixing lipid dissolved in ethanol with
an aqueous media containing OGN and result in LNP with
diameters of 100 nm or less and OGN encapsulation efﬁ-
ciencies of 65-95%. Both of these methods rely on the
presence of cationic lipid to achieve encapsulation of OGN
and poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) lipids to inhibit aggrega-
tion and the formation of large structures. The properties of
the LNP systems produced, including size and OGN encap-
sulation eﬁiciency, are sensitive to a variety of formulation
parameters such as ionic strength, lipid and ethanol concen-
tration, pH, OGN concentration and mixing rates. In general,
parameters such as the relative lipid and OGN concentra-
tions at the time of mixing, as well as the mixing rates are

Jan. 31, 2019

difﬁcult to control using current formulation procedures,
resulting in variability in the characteristics of LNP pro-
duced, both within and between preparations.

[0006] Microﬂuidic devices provide an ability to control-
lably and rapidly mix ﬂuids at the nanoliter scale with
precise control over temperature, residence times, and solute
concentrations. Controlled and rapid microﬂuidic mixing
has been previously applied in the synthesis of inorganic
nanoparticles and microparticles, and can outperform mac-
roscale systems in large scale production of nanoparticles.
Microﬂuidic two-phase droplet techniques have been
applied to produce monodisperse polymeric microparticles
for drug delivery or to produce large vesicles for the
encapsulation of cells, proteins, or other biomolecules. The
use of hydrodynamic ﬂow focusing, a common microﬁuidic
technique to provide rapid mixing of reagents, to create
monodisperse liposornes of controlled size has been dem-
onstrated. This technique has also proven useful in the
production of polymeric nanoparticles where smaller, more
monodisperse particles were obtained, with higher encap-
sulation of small molecules as compared to bulk production
methods.

[0007] Despite advances in the development of methods
for LNP systems containing genetic drugs, a need exist for
devices and methods for preparing lipid nanoparticles con-
taining therapeutic materials, as well as improved lipid
nanoparticles containing therapeutic materials. The present
invention seeks to fulﬁll this need and provides further
related advantages.

a single outlet (device 1200 includes mixing channels
1210a, 1210b, 12100, and 1210d).

[0062] FIG. 13 is a schematic illustration of a representa-
tive ﬂuidic device of the invention having a multilaminate
mixer (device 1300 includes mixing channel 1310).

[0063] FIG. 14 is a close-up View of the multilaminate
mixer illustrated in FIG. 14.

[0064] FIG. 15A is a schematic illustration of a represen-
tative microﬂuidic (MF) method of the invention for making
lipid nanoparticles (LNP): Lipid-ethanol and siRNA-aque-
ous solutions are pumped into inlets of a microﬂuidic mixing
device; herringbone features in the device induce chaotic
advection of the lamina: stream and cause the lipid species
to rapidly mix with the aqueous stream and form lipid
nanoparticles. The mixing channel is 200 um wide and 79
um high. The herringbone structures are 31 um high and 50
pm thick.

[0065] FIG. 15B is a schematic illustration of a preformed
vesicle (PFV) method for making lipid nanoparticles (LNP):
(a) a lipid-ethanol solution is added to an aqueous solution,
pH 40, resulting in the formation of vesicle type particles;
(b) extrusion through 80 nm polycarbonate membrane
(Nuclepore) at room temperature using a Lipex Extruder
provides a more uniform particle distribution; and (c) addi-
tion of siRNA solution while vortexing and incubation at 35°
C. for 30 minutes promotes encapsulation of siRNA
[0066] FIGS. 16A-16C illustrate the inﬂuence of ﬂow rate
in microﬂuidic device on mixing and LNP particle size. Two
10 [1M ﬂuorescein (ﬂuorescent at pH 8.8, non-ﬂuorescent at
pH 5.15) solutions mix to produce completely ﬂuorescent
solution. FIG. 16A compares the extent of mixing (%) as
determined by mean ﬂuorescent intensity along channel
width as a function of with mixing time (msec) calculated
from average ﬂuid velocity and travel length (0.2, 0.8, 1.4,
and 2 mL/min). FIGS. 16B and 16C compare mean particle
diameter for LNP composed of DLin-KCZ-DMA/DSPC/
Cholesterol/PEG-c-DMA at mole ratios of 402115247511,
siRNA-total lipid ratio 0.06 wt/wt, with 10 mM lipid-ethanol
phase mixed with 25 mM acetate buffer, pH 4, containing
siRNA. FIG. 16B compares mean particle diameter (nm) for
LNP as a function of ﬂow rate (mL/min). FIG. 16C com-
pares mean particle diameter (nm) for LNP as a function of
ethanol/aqueous ﬂow rate ratio. Error bars represent stan-
dard deviation of the mean particle diameter as measured by
dynamic light scattering.

[0067] FIG. 17 illustrates the inﬂuence of lipid concentra-
tion on LNP particle size by comparing mean particle
diameter (nm) as a function of lipid concentration in ethanol
(mM). Increasing the lipid concentration results in an
increase in mean particle diameter. The total lipid content in
the ethanol phase being mixing in the microﬂuidic chip was
varied from 10 mM to 50 mM. LNP composed of Dlin-
KCZ-DMA/DSPC/Cholesterol/PEG-c-DMA at mole ratios
of 40:11.5:47.5:1, siRNA-total lipid ratio 0.06 wat. Total
ﬂow rate inside microﬂuidic mixer was maintained at 2
ml/min. Error bars represent standard deviation of the mean
particle diameter as measured by dynamic light scattering.
[0068] FIGS. 18A and 18B illustrate the inﬂuence of
PEG-lipid and cationic lipid on LNP systems. FIG. 18A
compares mean particle diameter (nm) as a function of
PEG-c—DMA content (mol % in LNP) for LNP prepared by
the PFV and MF methods. The PEG-lipid was varied from
1 mol % to 10 mol % in the LNP composition. Modiﬁcation
of PEG-lipid content was compensated by adjustment of

analogue that is conforrnationally locked such that the ribose
ring is constrained by a methylene linkage between the
2'-oxygen and the 3'- or 4‘-carbon. The conformation restric-
tion imposed by the linkage often increases binding aﬁinity
for complementary sequences and increases the thermal
stability of such duplexes.

ribose sugar is attached to the N9-position of the nucleobase.
When the nucleobase is pyrimidine, e.g., C, T or U, the
pentose sugar is attached to the Nl-position of the nucle-
obase (Kornberg and Baker, (1992) DNA Replication, 2nd
Ed., Freeman, San Francisco, Calif),

[0128] One or more ofthe pentose carbons ofa nucleoside
may be substituted with a phosphate ester. In some embodi-

of the pentose. In some embodiments, the nucleosides are
those in which the nucleotide base is a purine, a 7-deazapu-
rine, a pyrimidine, a universal nucleotide base, a speciﬁc
nucleotide base, or an analog thereof.

nucleotide, nucleobase and/or sugar analogs.
Polynucleotides typically range in size from a few mono-
meric units, e.g., 3-40 when they are more commonly
frequently referred to in the art as oligonucleotides, to
several thousands of monomeric nucleotide units. Unless
denoted otherwise, whenever a polynucleotide sequence is
represented, it will be understood that the nucleotides are in

[0138] Lipid Particle Characteristics

[0139] Morphology. The lipid particle of the invention
differs from other similarly constituted materials by its
morphology and characterized as having a substantially
solid core. A lipid particle having a substantially solid core
is a particle that does not have extended aqueous regions on
the interior and that has an interior that is primarily lipid, In
one embodiment, an extended region is a continuous aque-
ous region with a volume greater than half the particle
volume. In a second embodiment, an extended aqueous
region is more than 25% of the particle volume. The extent
of internal aqueous regions may be determined by electron
microscopy and appear as regions of low electron density.
Further, because the interior of the solid core nanoparticle is
primarily lipid, the aqueous content of the particle (the
“trapped volume”) per lipid constituting the particle is less
than that expected for a unilamellar bi layer lipid vesicle with
the same radiusi In one embodiment, the trapped volume is
less than 50% of that expected for a unilamellar bi1ayer
vesicle with the same radius. In a second embodiment, the
trapped volume is less than 25% of that expected for a
unilamellar bi1ayer vesicle of the same size, In a third
embodiment, the trapped volume is less than 20% of the
total volume of the particle. In one embodiment, the trapped
volume per lipid is less than 2 microliter per micromole
lipid. In another embodiment the trapped volume is less than
1 microliter per micromole lipid. In addition, while the
trapped volume per lipid increases substantially for a bilayer
lipid vesicle as the radius of the vesicle is increased, the
trapped volume per lipid does not increase substantially as
the radius of solid core nanoparticles is increased In one
embodiment, the trapped volume per lipid increases by less
than 50% as the mean size is increased from a diameter of
20 nm to a diameter of 100 nm. In a second embodiment, the
trapped volume per lipid increases by less than 25% as the
mean size is increased from a diameter of 20 nm to a
diameter of 100 nm. The trapped volume can be measured
employing a variety of techniques described in the literature.
Because solid core systems contain lipid inside the particle,
the total number of particles of a given radius generated per
mole of lipid is less than expected for bi1ayer vesicle
systems, The number of particles generated per mol of lipid
can be measured by ﬂuorescence techniques amongst others.

[0140] The lipid particles of the invention can also be
characterized by electron microscopy The particles of the
invention having a substantially solid core have an electron
dense core as seen by electron microscopy. Electron dense
is deﬁned such that area-averaged electron density of the
interior 50% of the projected area of a solid core particle (as
seen in a 2-D cryo EM image) is not less than x% (x:20%,
40%, 60%) of the maximum electron density at the periph-
ery of the particle. Electron density is calculated as the
absolute value of the dilference in image intensity of the
region of interest from the background intensity in a region
containing no nanoparticle.

[0141] The results presented in this work demonstrate that
a microﬂuidic device containing a staggered herringbone
mixer can be used to generate LNP with a variety of lipid

[0119] Nucleic Acids. The lipid particles of the present
invention are useful for the systemic or local delivery of
nucleic acids. As described herein, the nucleic acid is
incorporated into the lipid particle during its formation.

[0120] As used herein, the term “nucleic acid” is meant to
include any oligonucleotide or polynucleotide. Fragments
containing up to 50 nucleotides are generally termed oligo-
nucleotides, and longer fragments are called polynucle-
otides. In particular embodiments, oligonucleotides of the
present invention are 20-50 nucleotides in length. In the
context of this invention, the terms “polynucleotide” and
“oligonucleotide” refer to a polymer or oligomer of nucleo-
tide or nucleoside monomers consisting of naturally occur-
ring bases, sugars and intersugar (backbone) linkages. The
terms “polynucleotide” and “oligonucleotide” also includes
polymers or oligomers comprising non-naturally occurring
monomers, or portions thereof, which function similarly.
Such modiﬁed or substituted oligonucleotides are often
preferred over native forms because of properties such as,
for example, enhanced cellular uptake and increased stabil-
ity in the presence of nucleases. Oligonucleotides are clas-
siﬁed as deoxyribooligonucleotides or ribooligonucleotides.
A deoxyrlbooligonucleotide consists of a 5-carbon sugar
called deoxyribose joined covalently to phosphate at the 5'
and 3‘ carbons of this sugar to form an alternating,
unbranched polymer. A ribooligonucleotide consists of a
similar repeating structure where the 5-carbon sugar is
ribose, The nucleic acid that is present in a lipid particle
according to this invention includes any form of nucleic acid
that is known. The nucleic acids used herein can be single-
stranded DNA or RNA, or double-stranded DNA or RNA, or
DNA-RNA hybrids. Examples of double-stranded DNA
include structural genes, genes including control and termi-
nation regions, and self-replicating systems such as viral or
plasmid DNA. Examples of double-stranded RNA include
siRNA and other RNA interference reagents. Single-
stranded nucleic acids include antisense oligonucleotides,
ribozymes, microRNA, and triplex-fonning oligonucle-
otides.

[0253] Preparation of lipid nanoparticles. LNP were pre-
pared by mixing desired volumes of lipid stock solutions in
ethanol with an aqueous phase employing the micro-mixer
described above. For the encapsulation of siRNA, the
desired amount of siRNA was mixed with 25 mM sodium
acetate buffer at pH 4. Equal volumes of the lipid/ethanol
phase and the siRNA/aqueous phase were combined in a
micro-mixer containing a herring-bone structure to promote
mixing. The ethanol content was quickly diluted to 25%
with sodium acetate buﬁer upon leaving the micro-mixer.
The ﬂow rate through the micro-mixing was regulated using
a dual-syringe pump (Kd Scientiﬁc). The lipid mixture then
underwent a 4 hour dialysis in 50 mM MES/sodium citrate
buﬂer (pH 6.7) followed by an overnight dialysis in phos-
phate buffered saline (pH 74).

[0254] Cryo-EM. Samples were prepared by applying 3
”L of PBS containing LNP at 20-40 mg/ml total lipid to a
standard electron microscopy grid with a perforated carbon
ﬁlm. Excess liquid was removed by blotting with a Vitrobot
system (FEI, Hillsboro, Oreg.) and then plunge-freezing the
LNP suspension in liquid ethane to rapidly freeze the
vesicles in a thin ﬁlm of amorphous, vitreous ice. Images
were taken under cryogenic conditions at a magniﬁcation of
29K with an AMT HR CCD side mount camera. Samples
were loaded with a Gatan 70 degree cryo-transfer holder in
an FEI G20 Lab6 200 kV TEM under low dose conditions
with an underfocus of 5-8 um to enhance image contrast.

[0255] RNase protection assay Factor VII siRNA was
encapsulated with 40% DLinKC2-DMA, 11% DSPC, 44%
cholesterol and 5% PEG-c-DMA using the microﬂuidics
mixing method. 1 ug of siRNA was incubated with 0.05 ug
RNaseA (Ambion, Austin, Tex.) in 50 uL of 20 mM HEPES
(pH 70) at 37° C for 1 hour. At the end of the incubation,
a 10 uL aliquot of the reaction mix was added to 30 uL FA
dye (deionized formaniide, TBE, PBS, xylene cyanol, bro-
mophenol blue, yeast tRNA) to halt the RNase reaction. Gel
electrophoresis was performed using 20% native polyacry-
lamide gel and nucleic acids were visualized by staining
with CYBR-Safe (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, Calif).

[0256] 31P-NMR studies. Proton decoupled 31P NMR
spectra were obtained using a Bruker AVII 400 spectrometer
operating at 162 MHz. Free induction decays (FID) corre-
sponding to about 104 scans were obtained with a 15 ps,
55-degree pulse with a l s interpulse delay and a spectral
width of 64 kHz. An exponential multiplication correspond-
ing to 50 Hz of line broadening was applied to the FID prior
to Fourier transformation. The sample temperature was
regulated using a Bruker BVT 3200 temperature unit. Mea-
surements were performed at 25° C.

[0257] FRET membrane fusion studies. Fusion between
LNP siRNA nanoparticles and anionic DOPS vesicles was
assayed by a lipid mixing assay employing ﬂuorescence
resonance energy transferi Labeled DOPS vesicles contain-
ing NBD-PE and Rh-PE (1 mol % each) were prepared by
direct re-hydration of lipid ﬁlm with the appropriate buffer
followed by 10 extrusions through a 100 nm pore size
polycarbonate membrane using the Lipex Extruder. LNP

cuvette containing 2 mL of 10 mM acetate, 10 mM MES, 10
mM HEPES, 130 mM NaCl equilibrated to pH 5.5. Fluo-
rescence of NBD-PE was monitored using 465 nrn excita-
tion, and 535 nm emission using an LS-55 Perkin Elmer
ﬂuorometer using a 1x1 cm cuvette under continuous low
speed stirring. Lipid mixing was monitored for approxi-
mately 10 min, after which 20 [IL of 10% Triton X-100 was
added to disrupt all lipid vesicles, representing inﬁnite probe
dilution. Lipid mixing as a percentage of inﬁnite probe
dilution was determined using the equation: % lipid mixing:
(F —F0)/(FMX—Fa)><100, where F is the ﬂuorescence intensity
at 535 nm during assay, F0 is the initial ﬂuorescence inten-
sity, and me is the maximum ﬂuorescence intensity at
inﬁnite probe dilution aﬂer the addition of Triton X-100.

[0258] Sequential Assembly of Lipid Nanoparticles
[0259] In this example, a representative method of the
invention, sequential assembly, for making lipid nanopar-
ticles is described.

[0260] The oligonucleotide (siRNA) solution was pre-
pared at 1.31 mg/ml in 25 mM acetate bulfer at pH 4.0. The
lipid mixture was prepared to contain 90 mol % cationic
lipid (DLin—KC2-DMA) and 10 mol % PEG-c-DMA (10
mM total lipid dissolved in ethanol). The two solutions were
mixed using the microﬂuidic mixer at a total ﬂow rate 2
ml/min and diluted 2-fold with 25 mM acetate buﬁer, pH
4.0, to bring ethanol down to about 23 vol %, forming the
initial or core nanoparticlei Sequential assembly was per-
formed by taking this initial lipid particle suspension and
mixing it with another lipid solution containing an anionic
lipid dioleoylphosphatidylserine (DOPS) dissolved in
methanol and further diluting to approximately 25 vol %
solvent (methanol and ethanol). The second lipid, DOPS,
was added at about 4x molar excess to the cationic lipid. The
sequential assembly process was repeated by alternating
between the cationic lipid and anionic lipid.

[0261] Particle size was determined by dynamic light
scattering using a Malvem Zetasizer Nano-ZS (Malvern
Instruments Ltd, Malvem, Worcestershire, UK). Number-
weighted distribution data was used. Zeta potential which
provides a measure of the surface charge of the LNP systems
was measured with the Malvem Zetasizer using disposable
capillary cells (DTS1060, Malvem Instruments Ltd.). The
LNP systems were diluted to approximately 0.3 mg/ml total
lipid in 25 mM acetate bulfer, pH 4.0.

[0263] In this example, a representative lipid particle the

[0264] The siRNA solution was prepared at 0.38 mg/ml in
25 mM acetate buffer, pH 4.0. The lipid solution was
prepared to contain DLin-KC2-DMA at a concentration of
10 mM in ethanol. The siRNA-to-lipid ratio was 0.06
(wt/wt) Each solution was input into the microﬂuidic mixer
at equal ﬂow rates and a total ﬂow rate of 2 ml/min. The
sample was further diluted with 25 mM acetate buﬂer, pH
4.0, to bring ethanol content to 25 vol %.

sulation 100%. With regard to formation of LNP, the rate and
ratio of mixing are clearly the important parameters. Rapid
mixing of the ethanol-lipid solution with aqueous buﬂer
results in an increased polarity of the medium that reduces
the solubility of dissolved lipids, causing them to precipitate
out of solution and form nanoparticles. Rapid mixing causes
the solution to quickly achieve a state of high supersatura-
tion of lipid unimers throughout the entire mixing volume,
resulting in the rapid and homogeneous nucleation of nano-
particles. Increased nucleation and growth of nanoparticles
depletes the surrounding liquid of free lipid, thereby limiting
subsequent growth by the aggregation of free lipid. This
proposed mechanism is consistent with the observation that
lower concentrations of the lipid in ethanol (reduced free
lipid) result in smaller LNP (see FIG. 17), that higher ﬂow
rates, causing a faster and more homogeneous approach to
supersaturation, lead to formation of smaller LNP, and that
increasing the relative ratio ofthe aqueous to organic solvent
components also results in smaller particles (FIG. 17).

[0217] LNP OGN systems of the invention formulated by
the microﬂuidics method exhibit OGN encapsulation eﬂi-
ciencies approaching 100%. Previous cryo-TEM studies
using the PFV technique for antisense OGN have revealed
the presence of small multilamellar vesicles leading to the
possibility that encapsulation involves OGN adsorption to a
preformed vesicle which serves as a nucleation point for
association with additional preformed vesicles that wrap
around the original vesicle. In contrast, cryo-TEM studies of
the LNP OGN produced by the microﬂuidics method show
that the majority of the LNP systems are “solid core”
structures and suggest that a different mechanism of OGN
encapsulation is operative. In particular, these structures are
consistent with the association of siRNA with cationic lipid
monomers prior to or simultaneously with nanoparticle
assembly, The ability of the microﬂuidics method to facili-
tate encapsulation efﬁciencies for antisense and siRNA OGN
approaching 100% independent of nucleic acid composition
is a major advantage over previously reported methods.

[0218] The microﬂuidics method provides advantages
over three alternative LNP synthesis techniques including
the classical extrusion procedure for producing LNP, tie
preformed vesicle method, and the spontaneous vesicle
formation methods for OGN encapsulation. The microﬂu-
idics method provides LNP in the 100 nm size range or
smaller and, when cationic lipid is present, allows LNP to e
formed with low levels of stabilizing PEG-lipid. Disadvan-
tages of the microﬂuidics method relate to the need to
remove ethanol after preparation, the fact that certain lipids
are relatively insoluble in ethanol, and potential scalability
issues. The microﬂuidics method otfers advantages in enca -
sulation eﬂiciencies, the use of high cationic lipid contents
and low PEG-lipid levels that are diﬂicult to employ using
the PFV process, removal of the need to generate preformed
vesicles, and the ability to produce small scale batches using
as little as 150m of oligonucleotide with little loss due to tie
small dead volume (1 pl) of the apparatus.

[0219] Advantages of the microﬂuidics method as com-
pared to the SVF “T tube” procedure for generating LNP
systems loaded with OGN are similar to those indicated or
the PFV process, with the exception that preformed vesic es
are not required. The aperture of the T tube is approximately
1.5 mm in diameter, requiring high ﬂow rates (>1 ml/s) to
achieve the velocities required for rapid mixing to occur.
The micromixer allows LNP OGN formulation to occur

 

Jan. 31, 2019

under well deﬁned, reproducible conditions at much lower
ﬂow rates and reduced losses due to dead volumes, allowing
more straightforward preparation of small scale batches for
LNP optimization and in vitro testing.

[0220] LNP OGN systems can be scaled up. Although a
device that has a maximum ﬂow rate of 1 ml/min may be
insufficient, a single microﬂuidics chip may contain 10 or
more micromixers in to achieve total ﬂow rates of about 10
mL/min. Given the relatively inexpensive nature of this
technology it is practical that a number of such chips to be
used in parallel, potentially allowing ﬂow rates of 100
ml/min or higher from a single bench-top instrument. Fur-
thermore, upstream ﬂuid handling could easily be incorpo-
rated into such a device to allow for precise programmable
formulations from multiple components. a feature that
would be highly advantageous in the screening and optimi-
zation of synthesis formulations and parameters.

[0221] Solid Core LNP

[0222] Certain models of LNP siRNA formulations sug-
gest a bilayer vesicle structure of the LNP with siRNA on the
inside in an aqueous interior. However a number of obser-
vations suggest that such models are incorrect, at least for
LNP siRNA systems generated by the microﬂuidic mixing
approach. For example, cryo-electron microscopy of LNP
siRNA systems produced by microﬂuidic mixing indicates
the presence of electron-dense cores rather than the aqueous
cores consistent with vesicular structure. As noted above,
formulation of LNP siRNA systems can routinely result in
siRNA encapsulation eﬂiciencies approaching 100%, an
observation that is not consistent with bilayer structures
where maximum encapsulation efﬁciencies of 50% might be
expected.

[0223] The structure of LNP siRNA systems was evalu-
ated employing a variety of physical and enzymatic assays,
The results obtained indicate that these LNP siRNA systems
have a solid core interior of consisting of siRNA monomers
complexed with cationic lipid as well as lipid organized in
inverted micellar or related structures.

[0224] LNP systems exhibit electron dense solid core
structure as indicated by cryo BM in the presence and
absence of encapsulated siRNA. LNP systems produced by
microﬂuidic mixing exhibit electron dense cores as visual-
ized by cryo EM, consistent with a solid cores, in contrast to
the aqueous core structures suggested for LNP siRNA
systems created by alternative methods. This was conﬁrmed
as shown in FIG. 22A for an LNP siRNA formulation
consisting of DLin-KC2-DMA/DSPC/Chol/PEG-lipid (40/
11,5/475/1; mol/mol) containing siRNA at a 0.06 siRNA/
lipid (wt/wt) content, which corresponds to a negative
charge (on the siRNA) to positive charge (on the fully
protonated cationic lipid) N/P ratio of 4. As a result approxi-
mately 75% of the cationic lipid is not complexed to siRNA
in the LNP. The solid core electron dense structure contrasts
with the less dense interior of a vesicle system composed of
POPC (FIG, 22B) and is visually similar to the electron
dense interior of a POPC/triolein (POPC/TO) LNP (FIG,
22C), POPC/TO LNP produced by microﬂuidic mixing
consist of a hydrophobic core of T0 surrounded by a
monolayer of POPC.

[0225] An interesting feature of FIG. 22A is that 75% of
the ionizable cationic lipid is not complexed to siRNA, but
the LNP siRNA particle as a whole exhibits a solid core
interior. This suggests that the cationic lipid may contribute
to the solid core interior even when it is not complexed to

device, the second the advantages of the microﬂuidics
approach as compared to previously available procedures
and third the potential improvements that can be made to this
process.

[0142] With regard to the mechanism(s) whereby the
microﬂuidics process allows the formation of LNI’ and LNP
containing OGN, two points of interest concern the mecha-
nism whereby LN'P of 100 um size or smaller are formed and
the mechanism whereby OGN can be encapsulated to levels
approaching 100%, With regard to formation of LNP the rate
of mixing is clearly the important parameter. Rapid mixing
of the ethanol-lipid solution with aqueous buﬁer results in an
increased polarity of the medium to some critical value
where the dissolved lipids come out of solution and form
bilayers. Rapid mixing results in high supersaturation of
lipid unimers throughout the mixing volume, and conse-
quently a rapid and homogeneous nucleation of nanopar-
ticles. Higher ﬂow rates increase the rate of supersaturation
and thus result in higher nucleation rates. Increased nucle-
ation and growth of nanoparticles depletes the surrounding
liquid of free lipid, limiting subsequent growth by the
aggregation of free lipid, This proposed mechanism is
consistent with the observation that lower concentrations of
the lipid in ethanol (reduced free lipid) result in smaller LNP
and that higher ﬂow rates, causing a faster and more
homogeneous approach to supersaturation, lead to formation
of smaller LN'P.

[0143] The observation that LN'P OGN systems formu-
lated by the microﬂuidics technique exhibit OGN encapsu-
lation eﬁ‘iciencies approaching 100% is diﬂicult to under-
stand in the absence of further morphological and other
studies. Cryo-TEM studies on the LNP OGN produced by
microﬂuidics show that the interior of the LNP is electron
dense, suggestive of a solid core of lipid and OGN. This
would suggest an encapsulation process whereby cationic
lipid and OGN associates and serves as a nucleus for
subsequent coating by DSPC and PEG-lipid, In any event,
the ability of the microﬂuidics formulation process to allow
encapsulation efﬁciencies for antisense and siRNA OGN
approaching 100% independent of nucleic acid composition
is a major advantage of the procedure.

[0144] Particle size, The lipid particle of the invention has
a diameter (mean particle diameter) from about 15 to about
300 nm, In some embodiments, the lipid particle has a
diameter of about 300 nm or less, 250 nm or less, 200 nm
or less, 150 nm or less, 100 nm or less, or 50 nm or less, In
one embodiment, the lipid particle has a diameter from about
15 to about 100 nm. These particles generally exhibit
increased circulatory lifetime in vivo compared to large
particles. In one embodiment, the lipid particle has a diam-
eter from about 15 to about 50 nm, These particles are
capable of advantageously escaping the vascular system, In
one embodiment, the lipid particle has a diameter from about
15 to about 20 nm, These particles near the limit size for
particles that contain a nucleic acid; such particles may
include a single polynucleotide (e.g., siRNA).

[0145] The lipid particles of the invention have a diameter
from about 30 to about 200 nm. In one embodiment, the lipid
particles have a diameter of about 80 nm.

[0146] The lipid particles of the invention are substantially
homogeneous in their size distribution. In certain embodi-
ments, the lipid particles of the invention have a mean
particle diameter standard deviation of from about 65 to
about 25%. In one embodiment, the lipid particles of the

Jan. 31, 2019

invention have a mean particle diameter standard deviation
of about 60, 50, 40, 35, or 30%.

[0147] Encapsulation efﬁciency. The lipid particles of the
invention can be further distinguished by the encapsulation
efﬁciency. As described below, the lipid particles of the
invention are prepared by a process by which nearly 100%
of the nucleic acid used in the formation process is encap-
sulated in the particles. In one embodiment, the lipid par-
ticles are prepared by a process by which from about 90 to
about 95% of the nucleic acid used in the formation process
is encapsulated in the particles,

[0148] Microﬂuidic Methods for Making Lipid Particles

[0149] In one aspect, the invention provides a method for
making lipid particles containing a therapeutic agent, In one
embodiment, the method includes

[0150] (a) introducing a ﬁrst stream comprising a thera-
peutic agent (erg, polynucleic acid) in a ﬁrst solvent into a
microchannel; wherein the microchannel has a ﬁrst region
adapted for ﬂowing one or more streams introduced into the
microchannel and a second region for mixing the contents of
the one or more streams;

[0151] (b) introducing a second stream comprising lipid
particle-forming materials in a second solvent in the micro-
channel to provide ﬁrst and second streams ﬂowing under
laminar ﬂow conditions, wherein the lipid particle-fonning
materials comprise an ionizable lipid, and wherein the ﬁrst
and second solvents are not the same;

[0152] (c) ﬂowing the one or more ﬁrst streams and the
one or more second strains from the ﬁrst region of the
microchannel into the second region of the microchannel;
and

[0153] (d) mixing of the contents of the one or more ﬁrst
streams and the one or more second streams ﬂowing under
laminar ﬂow conditions in the second region of the micro-
channel to provide a third stream comprising lipid particles
with encapsulated therapeutic agents,

[0154] The contents of the ﬁrst and second streams can be
mixed by chaotic advection. In one embodiment, mixing the
contents of the one or more ﬁrst strains and the one or more
second strains comprises varying the concentration or
relative mixing rates of the one or more ﬁrst streams and the
one or more second streams. In the above embodiment,
unlike known methods, the method does not include a
dilution after mixing.

[0155] To further stabilize the third stream containing the
lipid particles with encapsulated therapeutic agents, the
method can, but need not further include, comprising dilut-
ing the third strain with an aqueous buﬂer. In one embodi-
ment, diluting the third stream includes ﬂowing the third
stream and an aqueous buffer into a second mixing structure.
In another embodiment, the aqueous buffer comprising lipid
particles with encapsulated therapeutic agents is dialyzed to
reduce the amount of the second solvent,

[0156] The ﬁrst stream includes a therapeutic agent in a
ﬁrst solvent. Suitable ﬁist solvents include solvents in which
the therapeutic agents are soluble and that are miscible with
the second solvent. Suitable ﬁrst solvents include aqueous
buﬁers, Representative ﬁrst solvents include citrate and
acetate buﬁers,

[0157] The second stream includes lipid particle-forming
materials in a second solvent. Suitable second solvents
include solvents in which the ionizable lipids are soluble and
that are miscible with the ﬁrst solvent. Suitable second
solvents include 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydroﬁtran, acetone,
US 2019/0032087 A1
11

acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, dimethylformamide, acids,
and alcohols. Representative second solvents include aque-
ous ethanol 90%.

[0158] The methods of the invention are distinguished
from other microﬂuidic mixing methods in several ways.
Whereas certain known methods require an equal or sub-
stantially equal proportion of aqueous and organic solvents
(i.e:, 1:1), the method of the invention generally utilizes a
solvent ratio of aqueous to organic that exceeds 1:]. In
certain embodiments, the solvent ratio of aqueous to organic
is about 2:1. In certain embodiments, the solvent ratio of
aqueous to organic is about 3:1. In certain embodiments, the
solvent ratio of aqueous to organic is about 4:1. In certain
other embodiments, the solvent ratio of aqueous to organic
is about 5:1, about 10:1, about 50:], about 100:1, or greater.

[0159] The lipid particles of the invention are advanta-
geously formed in a microﬂuidic process that utilizes rela-
tively rapid mixing and high ﬂow rates. The rapid mixing
provide lipid particles having the advantageous properties
noted above including size, homogeneity, encapsulation
efﬁciency. Mixing rates used in the practice of the method of
the invention range from about 100 usec to about 10 msec.
Representative mixing rates include from about 1 to about 5
msec, Whereas hydrodynamic ﬂow focusing methods oper-
ate at relatively low ﬂow rates (e.g,, 5 to 100 uL/minute)
with relatively low lipid volumes, the method of the inven-
tion operates at relatively high ﬂow rates and relatively high
lipid volumes. In certain embodiments, for methods that
incorporate a single mixing region (i .e., mixer), the ﬂow rate
is about 1 mL/min. For methods of the invention that utilize
mixer arrays (e.g., 10 mixers), ﬂow rates of 40 mL/minute
are employed (for 100 mixers, ﬂow rate 400 mL/min). Thus,
the methods of the invention can be readily scaled to provide
quantities of lipid particles necessary for demanding pro-
duction requirements. Coupled with the advantageous par-
ticle size and homogeneity and encapsulation eﬁiciencies
realized, the method of the invention overcomes disadvan-
tages of known microﬂuidic methods for producing the lipid
particles. One advantage of the methods of the invention for
making the lipid particles is that the methods are scalable,
which means that the methods do not change on scaling and
that there is excellent correspondence on scaling.

[0160] Microﬂuidic Devices for Making Lipid Particles

[0161] In another aspect, the invention provide devices for
producing a lipid particle encapsulating a nucleic acid, In
one embodiment the device includes:

[0162] (a) a ﬁrst inlet for receiving a ﬁrst solution com-
prising a nucleic acid in a ﬁrst solvent;

[0163] (b) a ﬁrst inlet microchannel in ﬂuid communica-
tion with the ﬁrst inlet to provide a ﬁrst stream comprising
the nucleic acid in the ﬁrst solvent;

[0164] (c) a second inlet for receiving a second solution
comprising lipid particle-forming materials in a second
solvent;

[0165] (d) a second inlet microchannel in ﬂuid communi-
cation with the second inlet to provide a second stream
comprising the lipid particle-forming materials in the second
solvent;

[0166] (e) a third microchannel for receiving the ﬁrst and
second streams, wherein the third microchannel has a ﬁrst
region adapted for ﬂowing the ﬁrst and second streams
introduced into the microchannel under laminar ﬂow con-
ditions and a second region adapted for mixing the contents

Jan. 3], 2019

of the ﬁrst and second streams to provide a third stream
comprising lipid particles with encapsulated nucleic acid.
[0167] In one embodiment, the device further includes
means for diluting the third stream to provide a diluted
stream comprising stabilized lipid particles with encapsu-
lated therapeutic agent.

[0168] The device of the invention is a microﬂuidic device
including one or more microchannels (i,e., a channel having
its greatest dimension less than 1 millimeter). In one
embodiment, the microchannel has a hydrodynamic diam-
eter from about 20 to about 300 um. As noted above, the
microchannel has two regions: a ﬁrst region for receiving
and ﬂowing at least two streams (e.g., one or more ﬁrst
streams and one or more second streams) under laminar ﬂow
conditions, The contents of the ﬁrst and second streams are
mixed in the microchannel’s second region. In one embodi-
ment, the second region of the microchannel has a principal
ﬂow direction and one or more surfaces having at least one
groove or protrusion deﬁned therein, the groove or protru-
sion having an orientation that forms an angle with the
principal direction (eg, a staggered herringbone mixer), as
described in US. Application Publication No. 2004/
0262223, expressly incorporated herein by reference in its
entirety. In one embodiment, the second region of the
microchannel comprises bas-relief structures. To achieve
maximal mixing rates, it is advantageous to avoid undue
ﬂuidic resistance prior to the mixing region. Thus, one
embodiment of the invention is a device in which non-
microﬂuidic channels, having dimensions greater than 1000
microns, are used to deliver the ﬂuids to a single mixing
channel.

[0169] In other aspects of the invention, the ﬁrst and
second streams are mixed with other micromixers. Suitable
micromixers include droplet mixers, T-mixers, zigzag mix-
ers, multilaminate mixers, or other active mixers.

[0170] Mixing of the ﬁrst and second streams can also be
accomplished with means for varying the concentration and
relative ﬂow rates of the ﬁrst and second streams:

[0171] In another embodiment, the device for producing a
lipid particle encapsulating a nucleic acid includes micro-
channel for receiving the ﬁrst and second streams, wherein
the microchannel has a ﬁrst region adapted for ﬂowing the
ﬁrst and second streams introduced into the microchannel
under laminar ﬂow conditions and a second region adapted
for mixing the contents of the ﬁrst and second streams to
provide a third stream comprising lipid particles with encap-
sulated therapeutic agent: In this embodiment, the ﬁrst and
second stream are introduced into the microchannel by
means other than ﬁrst and second microchannels as noted
above.

[0172] To achieve maximal mixing rates it is advanta-
geous to avoid undue ﬂuidic resistance prior to the mixing
region, Thus one embodiment of the invention is a device in
which non-microﬂuidic channels, having dimensions greater
than 1000 microns, are used to deliver ﬂuids to a single
mixing channel: This device for producing a lipid particle
encapsulating a nucleic acid includes:

[0173] (a) a single inlet microchannel for receiving both a
ﬁrst solution comprising a nucleic acid in a ﬁrst solvent and
a second solution comprising lipid particle-forming materi-
als in a second solvent;

[0174] (b) a second region adapted for mixing the contents
of the ﬁrst and second streams to provide a third stream
comprising lipid particles with encapsulated nucleic acid.

siRNA. LNP systems with the same lipid composition but no
siRNA were formulated employing the microﬂuidics pro-
cess and characterized by cryo EM. As shown in FIG. 223,
the electron dense core was observed in the absence of
siRNA, indicating that ionizable cationic lipids such as
DLin-KCZ-DMA, possibly in combination with DSPC and
cholesterol, can adopt non-lamellar electron dense structures
in the LNP interior.

[0226] LNP structures exhibit limit sizes indicating that
ionizable cationic lipid forms inverted micellar structures in
the LNP interior. The contribution of the cationic lipid to the
electron dense LNP core raises the question of what the
molecular structure of such LNP systems may be It is
logical to propose that the cationic lipid, in association with
a counter-ion, adopts an inverted structure such as an
inverted micelle, consistent with the propensity of these
lipids for inverted structures such as the hexagonal H11 phase
in mixtures with anionic lipids. In turn, this would suggest
tiat LNP systems composed of pure cationic lipid should
exhibit limit sizes with diameters in the range of 10 nm,
which is essentially the thickness of two bilayers surround-
ing an inverted micelle interior with diameter 2-3 nm, The
ciameter of the aqueous channels found for phosphatidyle-
tianolamine in the H” phase is 2.6 nm. The microﬂuidics
formulation process provides fast mixing kinetics that drive
tie generation of limit size systems for LNP systems. The
limit size that could be achieved for a DLin-KCZ-DMA/
PEG-lipid system (90/10, mol/mol) was evaluated, As
shown in FIG. 23, measurements by dynamic light scattering
on these LNP formed by the microﬂuidic method conﬁrm
tiat the particle size is approximately 10 nm in diameter, a
ﬁnding that is not consistent with a signiﬁcant aqueous core
or trapped volume.

[0227] A related question concerns the structure of the
cationic lipid-siRNA complex. Again, it is logical to suppose
tiat it consists of a distorted inverted micelle of cationic
lipid surrounding the siRNA oligonucleotidei In turn, this
would suggest a limit size in the range of 15-20 nm,
assuming that the siRNA contained in this inverted micelle
is surrounded by an interior monolayer of cationic lipid and
tien an outer monolayer of remaining lipid and that the
c imensions of the siRNA are 26 mn in diameter and 4.8 nm
in length. In order to determine whether this is consistent
with experiment, the limit size of LNP siRNA systems
consisting of DLin—KCZ-DMA and PEG-lipid (90/10; mol/
mol) at high levels of siRNA corresponding to an N/P ratio
of one was determined, As shown in FIG. 23, the inclusion
of siRNA resulted in a limit size systems of approximately
21 nm diameter, consistent with hypothesis.

[0228] Encapsulated siRNA is immobilized in the LNP. If
the siRNA is complexed to cationic lipid and localized in a
solid core inside the LNP it would be expected to be less
mobile than if freely tumbling in the aqueous interior of a
bilayer vesicle system. The mobility of the siRNA can be
probed using 3 1P NMR techniques In particular, it would be
expected that limited motional averaging would be possible
for complexed siRNA, leading to very broad “solid state”
31P NMR resonances due to the large chemical shift anisot-
ropy of the phosphate phosphorus. Under the conditions
employed, such resonances would not be detectable. If, on
the other hand, the siRNA is able to freely tumble in an
aqueous environment, rapid motional averaging would be
expected to lead to narrow, readily detectable, ”P NMR
spectra. In order to eliminate complications arising from 311’

 

Jan. 31, 2019

NMR signals arising from the phospholipid phosphorus,
DSPC was omitted from formulations of LNP to test this
hypothesis. As shown in FIG. 24A, for LNP siRNA systems
with lipid composition DLin-KC2-DMA/Chol/PEG-lipid
(50/45/5 mol %) and containing siRNA (0,06 siRNA/lipid;
wt/wt), no 311) NMR signal is observable for the encapsu-
lated siRNA, consistent with immobilization within the LNP
core. If the detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate is added (1%)
to solubilize the LNP and release the encapsulated siRNA
then a narrow 31P NMR signal is detected as shown in FIG.
24C.

[0229] Encapsulated siRNA is fully protected from deg-
radation by external RNase A. Atest of the internalization of
siRNA is that if siRNA are sequestered in the LNP core they
should be fully protected from degradation by externally
added RNase. LNP siRNA systems with the lipid composi-
tion DLin-KC2-DMA/DSPC/Chol/PEG-lipid (40/ l 1/44/5
mol 0/0) were incubated with RNase A to determine whether
encapsulated siRNA could be digested. As shown in the gel
presented in FIG. 25, the free siRNA is degraded, while the
siRNA associated within the LNP particles made by the
microﬂuidic method is completely protected (FIG, 25
arrow). As also shown in FIG, 25, addition of the detergent
Triton X-100 to the LNP results in dissolution of the LNP,
release of the siRNA, and degradation in the presence of
RNase.

[0230] Encapsulated siRNA is complexed with internal-
ized cationic lipid. The solid core ofthe LNP siRNA systems
consists of encapsulated siRNA complexed to cationic lipid
and the remaining lipid (cationic lipid, cholesterol and
PEG-lipid) is either present in the core in inverted micellar
or similar structures, or resident on the LNP exterior. For
high siRNA contents, where essentially all of the cationic
lipid is complexed with internalized siRNA, it would be
expected that little cationic lipid would be localized on the
LNP exterior. A ﬂuorescence resonance energy transfer
(FRET) assay was developed to determine external cationic
lipid. The assay required the preparation of negatively
charged vesicular LNP composed of dioleoylphosphatidyl-
serine (DOPS) that contained the FRET pair, NBD-PE/Rh-
PE at high (self-quenching) concentrations. The negatively
charged DOPS LNP were then incubated with LNP siRNA
systems consisting of DLin-KCZ-DMA/DSPCJChol/PEG-
lipid (40/115/475/1 mol %) at pH 5.5. The pKa of DLin-
KCZ-DMA is 6.7 and thus nearly all the DLin—KCZ-DMA on
the outside of the LNP will be charged at pH 5.5, promoting
an interaction and potentially fusion with the negatively
charged DOPS LNPI Fusion is reported as an increase in the
NED-PE ﬂuorescence at 535 nm as the NBD-PE and Rh-PE
probes become diluted following lipid mixing.

[0231] As shown in FIG, 26, when the LNP systems
contained no siRNA substantial fusion is observed consis-
tent with a considerable proportion of the DLin-KC2-DMA
residing on the outer monolayer of the LNP system. When
the LNP systems contained siRNA at a siRNA to lipid ratio
of 0.06 (wt/wt), which corresponds to a positive (cationic
lipid) charge to negative (siRNA) N/P charge ratio of 4,
however, fusion was considerably reduced (FIG. 26),
whereas for LNP siRNA systems prepared with an N/P of 1,
little or no fusion was observed, indicating that little of no
DLin-KC2-DMA was present on the LNP siRNA exterior.
This supports the hypothesis that high siRNA content essen-
tially all of the cationic lipid is complexed with siRNA and
sequestered in the LNP interior.

[0184] Any combination of any number of parallel reagent
inlets, sequential mixing chambers, and branching architec-
tures can be used to optimize the nanoparticle formulation
process. This has the advantage that different formulation
process can be precisely controlled and multiple steps of the
nanoparticle formulation process can be integrated.
Examples include, but are not limited to, the following: (a)
the introduction of two or more inlets consisting of combi-
nations of distinct (FIG. 8) or the same (FIG. 9) reagents to
allow for the independent input control (uses include inde-
pendent control of the flow rates of the input reagents,
varying the ratios between input reagents, and others; (b)
two or more mixers in sequence to allow for the sequential
addition of nanoparticle reagents or formulation processing
steps (FIG. 10) (uses include the addition of input reagents
in sequence for the controlled bottom up assembly of
nanoparticles, the integration of formulation processes like
dilution, pH adjustments, or other events required for nano-
particle synthesis, and others; or (c) any combination of
inputs, mixing chambers, and branching architectures, FIG.
11 and FIG. 12 illustrate two step and three step mixers with
a varying number of parallel reagent inputs and branching
microﬂuidic smrctures (uses include the integration of mul-
tiple steps of the formulation process that includes on chip
mixing of nanoparticle reagents, nanoparticle nucleation and
growth, on-chip dilution, dialysis, pH adjustments or other
events required for nanoparticle synthesis.

[0185] FIG. 13 is a schematic illustration of a representa-
tive ﬂuidic device of the invention having a multilaminate
mixer. Referring to FIG, 13, device 1300 includes mixing
channels 1310. FIG. 14 is a close-up View of the multilami-
nate mixer illustrated in FIG. 14.

[0186] As described above, methods of making lipid
micro/nanoparticles have been conventionally “top down”
approaches where larger structures are formed by dispersion
of lipids in water, followed by disruption of the multilamel-
lar vesicles (micron size range) through polycarbonate ﬁlters
with a pore size such as 100 nm or alternatively, using tip
sonication.

[0187] One aspect lacking in such batch processes is the
ability to precisely control the structure and assembly of
each lipid mixture constituent. This is especially important
if certain constituents are easily degraded if exposed to their
external environment, or if certain ligands must reside on the
exterior of the particle for targeting purposes. For example,
with therapeutics it may be important to ﬁrst produce a
particle that has a net positive or negative surface charge to
associate a certain therapeutic drug. Further processing may
then be needed to complete the assembly, by encapsulating
such a particle with other lipid material or to modify its
surface characteristics. This may for example include addi-
tion of lipids to produce a net neutral particle, or addition of

13

Jan. 3], 2019

targeting molecules that must reside on the exterior of the
particle for functional purposes.

[0188] In one embodiment, the method for making lipid
nanoparticles includes sequential assembly and growth of
lipid nanoparticles through charge association, and further,
can provide encapsulation of therapeutic small interfering
RNA (siRNA). This method can be used to completely alter
the surface charge characteristics from net positive to net
negative and vice versa.

[0189] A lipid nanoparticle encapsulating siRNA (—ive)
was prepared with a charge ratio of about 2 (+ive/—ive). The
lipids included 90 mol % DLin-KC2-DMA (+ive) and 10
mol % PEG-c-DMA. The resulting particle was 23 nm in
diameter (FIG, 28A) and had a positive zeta potential of
about 7 mV (FIG. 28B). The anionic lipid was then incor-
poration in 4-fold excess to the cationic lipid via microﬂu-
idic mixing. This led to an increase in particle size to 33 nm
and a shift to a negative zeta potential of —14 mV. Further
incorporation of additional cationic lipid (in 4-fold excess to
the previous DOPS) and then incorporation of DOPS led to
a continued increase in particle size and alteration between
net positive and net negative zeta potentials.

[0190] The results were obtained by mixing in a single
microﬂuidic mixer, recovered, and then re-injected into the
micromixer to add the next lipid component. However, a
single microﬂuidic device could be designed to produce
such particles in a continuous manner (FIG. 29).

[0191] The following devices minimize the ﬂuidic imped-
ances and the interaction between the lipid and aqueous
ﬂuids prior to entering the micromixer.

terol, and a PEG-lipid at the appropriate molar ratio was
prepared in ethanol and diluted with 25 mM acetate buﬂer
to achieve an ethanol concentration of 90% (v/v). FIG. 158
is a schematic illustration of the microﬂuidic apparatus used
in this example, The device has two inlets, one for each of
the solutions prepared above, and one outlet, The microﬂu-
idic device was produced by soﬂ lithography, the replica
molding of microfabricated masters in elastomer The device
features a 200 um wide and 79 um high mixing channel with
herringbone structures formed by 31 pm high and 50 pm
thick features on the roof of the channel. Fluidic connections
were made with 1/32" 1D,, 3/32" OD. tubing that was attached
to 21 G1 needles for connection with syringes. 1 ml syringes
were generally used for both inlet streams, A dual syringe
pump (KD200, KD Scientiﬁc) was used to control the ﬂow
rate through the device. The ﬂow rate of each stream was
varied from 0.1 ml/min to 1 ml/min, The syringe pump
introduces the two solutions into the microﬂuidic device
(inlet a and inlet b in FIG 15B), where they come into
contact at a Y-junctioni Insigniﬁcant mixing occurs under
laminar ﬂow by diffusion at this point, whereas the two
solutions become mixed as they pass along the heningbone
structures.

[0245] Mixing occurs in these structures by chaotic advec-
tion, causing the characteristic separation of laminate
streams to become increasingly small, thereby promoting
rapid diﬁusion. This mixing occurs on a millisecond time
scale and results in the lipids being transferred to a progres-
sively more aqueous environment, reducing their solubility
and resulting in the spontaneous formation of LNP By
including cationic lipids in the lipid composition, entrap-
ment of oligonucleotide species is obtained through asso-
ciation of the positively charged lipid head group and
negatively charged oligonucleotide. Following mixing in the
microﬂuidic device, the LNP mixture was generally diluted
into a glass vial containing two volumes of stirred buifer.
Ethanol is ﬁnally removed through dialysis to 50 mM citrate
buffer, pH 40 and then dialysis to PBS, pH 74 Empty
vesicles were similarly produced, with the oligonucleotide
absent from the buffer solution.

[0246] LNP Image Analysis. Mixing times were measured
by ﬂuorescent imaging of the mixing of ﬂuorescein solutions
with different pH values. Images were collected using an
Olympus inverted confocal microscope using a 10x objec-
tive and Kalman ﬁlter mode with 2 scans per line, Twenty-
ﬁve equally spaced slices were taken along the height of the
channel and combined to determine total intensity proﬁles,
For each position imaged, ten adjacent rows of pixels along
the ﬂow direction were averaged to obtain an intensity
proﬁle along the width of the channel and used to determine
the extent of mixing. Mixing experiments were performed
with two 10 uM ﬂuorescein solutions supplemented with 0.5
M NaCl to suppress the formation of a liquid junction
potential due to a large difference in sodium and phosphate
ion concentrations, One solution contained 14 mM phos-
phate buffer at pH 8.88, while the other contained 1 mM
phosphate buﬁer at pH 5.15. The increase in ﬂuorescence of
the solution initially at pH 5.15 will overwhelm the small
drop in ﬂuorescence in the basic solution, resulting in an
increase in total ﬂuorescence intensity by a factor of two,
The extent of mixing was determined at approximately 2.1
mm, 6.2 mm, and 10.1 mm along the channel length using
ﬂow rates of the individual streams at 0.1 ml/min, 0.4
ml/min, 0.7 ml/min and 1.0 ml/min

[0247] LNP Characterization. Particle size was deter-
mined by dynamic light scattering using a Nicomp model
370 Submicron Particle Sizer (Particle Sizing Systems,
Santa Barbara, Calif). Number-weighted and intensity-
weighted distribution data was used, Lipid concentrations
were veriﬁed by measuring total cholesterol using the Cho-
lesterol E enzymatic assay from Wako Chemicals USA
(Richmond, Va) Removal of free siRNA was performed
with VivaPureD MiniH columns (Sartorius Stedim Biotech
GmbH, Goettingen, Germany). The eluents were then lysed
in 75% ethanol and siRNA was quantiﬁed by measuring
absorbance at 260 nm, Encapsulation eﬂiciency was deter-
mined from the ratio of oligonucleotide before and after
removal of free oligonucleotide content, normalized to lipid
content

[0248] LNP Cyro-Transmission Electron Microscopy.
Samples were prepared by applying 3 [LL of PBS containing
LNP at 20-40 mg/ml total lipid to a standard electron
microscopy grid with a perforated carbon ﬁlm. Excess liquid
was removed by blotting with a Vitrobot system (FEI,
Hillsboro, Greg) and then plunge-freezing the LNP suspen-
sion in liquid ethane to rapidly freeze the vesicles in a thin
ﬁlm of amorphous ice. Images were taken under cryogenic
conditions at a magniﬁcation of 29K with an AMT HR CCD
side mount camera. Samples were loaded with a Gatan 70
degree cryo—transfer holder in an FBI G20 Lab6 200 kV
TEM under low dose conditions with an underfocus of 5-8
pm to enhance image contrast.

[0249] In vivo Activity of LNP-siRNA for FVII activity.
Six to eight week old, female C57B1/6 mice were obtained
from Charles River Laboratories. LNP-siRNA containing
Factor VII siRNA were ﬁltered through a 0.2 pm ﬁlter and
diluted to the required concentrations in sterile phosphate
buffered saline prior to use, The formulations were admin-
istered intravenously Via the lateral tail vein at a volume of
10 ml/kg, After 24 h, animals were anaesthetized with
KetamineJXylazine and blood was collected by cardiac
puncture. Samples were processed to serum (Microtainer
Serum Separator Tubes; Becton Dickinson, NJ.) and tested
immediately or stored at —700 C. for later analysis of serum
Factor VII levels. All procedures were performed in accor-
dance with local, state, and federal regulations as applicable
and approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Connnittee (IACUC).

[0250] Serum Factor VII levels were determined using the
colorimetric Biophen VII assay kit (Anaira), Control serum
was pooled and serially diluted (200%-3.125%) to produce
a calibration curve for calculation of FVII levels in treated
animals. Appropriately diluted plasma samples from treated
animals (n:3 per dosage) and a saline control group (n:4)
were analyzed using the Biophen VII kit according to
manufacturer’s instructions, Analysis was performed in
96-well, ﬂat bottom, non-binding polystyrene assay plates
(Corning, Coming, NiYi) and absorbance was measured at
405 nm. Factor VII levels in treated animals were deter-
mined from a calibration curve produced with the serially
diluted control serum.

[0251] LNP Systems: Solid Core

[0252] In the example, a structure of a representative
LNP-siRNA system of the invention having a solid core is
described.
US 2019/0032087 A1

[0232] The results provide evidence that the interior of
LNP siRNA systems consist of a solid core composed of
siRNA monomers complexed to cationic lipids, as well as
lipids arranged in inverted micelle or related structures.
These results imply a model for LNP siRNA structure,
provide a rationale for the high siRNA encapsulation efﬁ-
ciencies that can be achieved and suggest methods for
manufacturing LNP siRNA systems with properties appro-
priate to particular applications.

[0233] The model for LNP siRNA structure based on the
results is shown in FIG. 27. The model proposes that
encapsulated siRNA resides in a distorted inverted micelle
surrounded by cationic lipid, and that remaining lipid is
organized in inverted micelles surrounding anionic counte-
rions and also makes up the outermost monolayer.

[0234] The model provides an understanding of how
siRNA encapsulation eﬂiciencies approaching 100% can be
achieved during the microﬂuidic mixing formulation pro-
cess. This is a major problem for siRNA encapsulation in
bilayer systems because, assuming the cationic lipid is
equally distributed on both sides of the bilayer, a maximum
of 50% siRNA internalization would be expected. The
model points to ways in which LNP siRNA size, composi-
tion, and surface charge may be readily modulated, With
regard to size, the limit size structure is clearly one that
contains one siRNA monomer per particle, suggesting a
limit size of approximately 15-20 nm. Such LNP siRNA
particles are readily achieved using microﬂuidic method of
the invention. The limit size LNP siRNA system consisting
ofa monomer of siRNA can be potentially used as a building
block to achieve LNP siRNA systems of varying composi-
tion and surface charge using microﬂuidic mixing technol-
ogy. Rapid mixing of preformed limit size LNP siRNA with
an ethanol solution containing negatively charged lipids, for
example, may be expected to result in an interaction with
excess cationic lipids to produce internal inverted micellar
core structures and a negatively charged surface.

[0235] The lipid particles of the invention described herein
include (i.e., comprise) the components recited. In certain
embodiments, the particles of the invention include the
recited components and other additional components that do
not aﬁect the characteristics of the particles (i.e., the par-
ticles consist essentially of the recited components). Addi-
tional components that alfect the particles’ characteristics
include components such as additional therapeutic agents
that disadvantageously alter or aﬁect therapeutic proﬁle and
eﬁicacy of the particles, additional components that disad-
vantageously alter or aﬁect the ability of the particles to
solubilize the recited therapeutic agent components, and
additional components that disadvantageously alter or affect
the ability of the particles to increase the bioavailability of
the recited therapeutic agent components. In other embodi-
ments, the particles of the invention include only (i.e.,
consist of) the recited components.

[0240] In the example, the preparation of an LNP-siRNA
system using the preformed vesicle method is described
[0241] LNP-siRNA systems were made using the pre-
formed vesicle method as depicted in FIG. 15A and as

somes: Formation of Small Multilamellar Liposomes," Bio,
phys. J.. 80:2310-2326 (2001). Cationic lipid, DSPC,
cholesterol and PEG-lipid were ﬁrst solubilized in ethanol at
the appropriate molar ratio. The lipid mixture was then
added dropwise to an aqueous buﬁer (citrate or acetate
buﬂer, pH 4) while vortexing to a ﬁnal ethanol and lipid
concentration of 30% (v/v). The hydrated lipids were then
extruded ﬁve times through two stacked 80 nm pore-sized

Extruder (Northern Lipids, Vancouver, Canada). The siRNA
(solubilized in an identical aqueous solution containing 30%

siRNA The ethanol was then removed and the external
buﬁer replaced with phosphate-buﬁered saline (PBS) by
dialysis (12-14 k MW cut-oﬁ, Spectrum medical instru-
ments) to 50 mM citrate buffer, pH 4.0 and then dialysis to
PBS, pH 7.4.

[0180] FIG, 6 is a schematic illustration of another repre-
sentative ﬂuidic device (600) of the invention. Referring to
FIG. 6, device 600 includes mixing channels 610a, 6101;,
and 6100. FIG. 7 is a schematic illustration of a represen-
tative array of the representative ﬂuidic device illustrated in
FIG. 6.

[0181] The formation of nanopartic es on microﬂuidic
devices is limited by the reagent volumes that participate in
the mixing event and the limited backpressure that devices
can withstand before leakage occurs, Single elements of the
herringbone or multilaminate mixer achieve a 100-1000 fold
increase in ﬂow rate compared to drop et or ﬂow focusing
approaches. In order to achieve production scale throughput,
multiple mixer elements can be arrayed. In one embodiment
each reagent is distributed to the individual mixer elements
using a low impedance bus channel. If the impedance of the
bus channel is negligible compared to tie impedance of the
mixer element, the individual ﬂow rates at the inlet of each
mixer are identical. As multiple mixer e ements are operated
in parallel, the impedance of the system decreases resulting
in a higher volumetric throughput
[0182] This has the advantage that the mixing character-
istics that are observed using a single mixer element can be
maintained in a mixer array. In one em nodiment, mixing in
each mixer array element is achieved 3y introducing mul-
tiple streams into a microchannel. In tiis case the streams
will mix by diﬁusioni The width of the streamlines may be
varied by controlling the relative ﬂow rates through the
injection channels (e.g., by adjusting the dimensions of these
channels (FIG. 5). In another embodiment, mixing is
achieved by chaotic advection (staggered herringbone
mixer, SHM). As shown in FIG. 7, each mixer element of the
array may consist of a series of mixers. By adding elements
to each array subset additional functionalities can be inte-
grated in-line on the microﬂuidic device Such functional-
ities may include on-chip dilution, dialysis, pH adjustments
or other events that require interlaced streamlines, streams
sharing the same channel or streams that are separated from
each other by a porous material. In one embodiment, 10 mM
POPC is dissolved in 100% ethanol and mixed with phos-
phate buffered saline (PBS), pH 7.4 in the ﬁrst mixer
element of each array subset. The LNPs that are formed after
mixing are stabilized by diluting the mixture by a factor of
2 with PBS.

[0183] Table 1 compares the size distribution of particles
formed on a single mixer and a mixer array consisting often
individual mixers. The total ﬂow rate through a single mixer
may be 4 ml/min with a mixing ratio of 50:50 at each
intersection, The volumetric throughput can be increased
ten-fold by operating ten mixers in parallel resulting in a
total volumetric ﬂow rate of 40 ml/min. While the through-
put of the array is amenable to production scale synthesis,
LNP dimensions are maintained.

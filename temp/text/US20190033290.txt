lacetone, in the breath of patients with IA that were not
induced by any of our in vitro culture conditions.

[0104] While some of the key VOCs identiﬁed in A
fumigatus in Vitro were present equally in patients with and
without IA, a combination of the sesquiterpenes farnesene
and beta-vatirenene and the oxidized farnesene derivative
cis-geranylacetone distinguished patients with IA from
patients without IA correctly in 51/54 (94%) patients (FIG.
13)727 of 29 patients with 1A (sensitivity:93%) and 24 or
25 patients who ultimately had other causes of pneumonia
(sensitivity:96%). These VOCs were absent in ambient air
control samples collected concurrently with each breath
sample.

[0105] Breath was collected from a few patients serially
following initiation of antifungal therapy and these key A.
ﬁ4migatu: VOCs appeared to decline over 1-2 weeks of
treatment.

CLAIM OF PRIORITY

[0001] This application is a divisional of US. patent
application Sen No, 14/426,678, ﬁled Mar, 6, 2015, which is
a US. National Phase Application under 35 U.S.Ci § 371 of
International Patent Application No. PCT/US2013/058560,
ﬁled on Sep. 6, 2013, which claims the beneﬁt of US.
Provisional Application Ser No. 61/698,155, ﬁled on Sep. 7,
2012, The entire contents of the foregoing are incorporated
herein by reference.

FEDERALLY SPONSORED RESEARCH OR
DEVELOPMENT

[0002] This invention was made with Government support
under Grants No, R21A1085454, K23A1097225 and
8UL1TR000170 awarded by the National Institutes of
Health The Government has certain rights in the invention

TECHNICAL FIELD

[0003] Provided herein are methods for diagnosing, treat-
ing, and monitoring the treatment of invasive aspergillosis
(IA), The methods can include detecting the presence of one
or more volatile organic compounds (V OCs) in the breath of
subjects suspected of having IA.

BACKGROUND

[0004] IA is a common, rapidly progressive, highly mor-
bid, and frequently fatal infection in irnmunocompromised
patients, especially in patients with chemotherapy-induced
neutropenia or who are innnunosuppressed as a result of
receiving glucocorticoid treatment for graﬁ-versus-host dis-
ease (GVHD). Timely diagnosis with prompt initiation of
appropriate antifungal therapy improves clinical outcomes,
Unfortunately, clinical and radiographic manifestations are
nonspeciﬁc, and standard culture and antigen diagnostic
approaches lack sensitivity and speciﬁcity for IA, Deﬁnitive
diagnosis still relies on biopsy, which is often unacceptably
morbid and frequently uninformative in these debilitated
patients,

SUMMARY

[0005] As described herein, the present inventors have (1)
identiﬁed a unique, species-speciﬁc proﬁle of volatile
organic compounds (VOCs) produced by Aspergillus
ﬁrmigatus, A. terreus, A, calia'oustus, and other pathogenic
fungi in vitro that can be used to distinguish pathogenic
fungal species from each other, (2) demonstrated that dif-
ferential mobility spectrometry (DMS) can be used for the
rapid discrimination between fungal species using pattem-
based detection of these species-speciﬁc VOC proﬁles, and
(3) accurately identiﬁed patients with invasive aspergillosis
(IA) via direct detection of a pattern of A, fumigatus VOCs
in their breath, including a combination of farnesene, beta-
vatirenene, and cis-geranylacetone.

[0006] Thus in a ﬁrst aspect, the invention provides meth-
ods for diagnosing a subject with invasive aspergillosis (IA),
The methods include obtaining a sample comprising breath
of a subject or headspace from a culture suspected of
comprising Aspergillus isolated from a subject; detecting the
presence in the sample of one, two, three, or more volatile

Jan. 31, 2019

organic compounds (VOCs) produced by the Aspergillus
species in a sample comprising breath from the subject or
headspace from a culture suspected of comprising Aspergil-
[us isolated from the subject, wherein the VOCs are selected
from the group consisting of farnesene, beta-vatirenene,
cis-geranylacetone, camphene, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene,
limonene, alpha-bergarnotene, farnesene, elixene, alpha-
santalene, beta-elemene, acoradien, chamigrene, 1,5,9-t1im-
ethyl cyclododecatriene, 9-decene-2-one and beta-ses-
quiphellandrene; and diagnosing a subject as having IA
based on the presence of (i,e,, when there are) one, two, three
or more of the VOCs in the sample.

[0007] In some embodiments, the methods include detect-
ing the presence in the sample of one, two or three VOCs
selected from the group consisting of faniesene, beta-vat-
irenene and cis-geranylacetone; and diagnosing a subject
who has one, two or all three of farnesene, beta-vatirenene
and cis-geranylacetone in the sample as having IA, In
Jreferred embodiments, a diagnosis of IA is based on the
aresence of all three of the VOCs farnesene, beta-vatirenene
and cis-geranylacetone in the sample,

[0008] In another aspect, the invention provides methods
or treating a subject who has invasive aspergillosis (IA).
The methods include obtaining a sample comprising breath
of a subject or headspace from a culture suspected of
comprising Aspergillus isolated from a subject; detecting the
aresence in the sample of one, two or three VOCs selected
from the group consisting of farnesene, bem-vatirenene and
cis-geranylacetone, and administering an antifungal treat-
ment to a subject who has one, two or all three of farnesene,
eta-vatirenene and cis-geranylacetone in their breath.

[0009] In some embodiments, the treatment includes
administration of one or more doses of one or more anti-
ungal compounds, e,g., an amphotericin B formulation; an
azole compound; and an echinocandin,

[0010] In another aspect, the invention provides methods
or detecting the presence of an Aspergillus fumigatus, A.
lerreus, orA. calidoustu: infection in a subject. The methods
include obtaining a sample comprising breath of a subject,
or headspace from a culture suspected of comprising Asper—
gillus isolated from a subject; determining the presence of
one, two, three, or more, e.g., all, of the VOCs selected from
the group consisting of camphene, alpha-pinene, beta-
pinene, limonene, alpha-bergamotene, farnesene, elixene,
alpha-santalene, beta-elemene, acoradien, chamigrene, 1,5,
9-trimethyl cyclododecatriene, 9-decene-2-one and beta-
sesquiphellandrene in the sample. The presence of one, two,
three, or more, eg, all, of camphene, alpha-pinene, beta-
pinene, limonene, alpha-bergamotene, or farnesene indicates
the presence of an A. fumigatus infection; the presence of
one, two, three, or more, e,g,, all, of elixene, alpha-santal-
ene, beta-elemene, acoradien, chamigrene, and 1,5,9-trim-
ethyl cyclododecatriene indicates the presence of an A,
Ierreur infection; and the presence of one or both of 9-de-
cene-2-one and beta-sesquiphellandrene indicates the pres-
ence of an A. calia'oustus infection in the subject.

 

[0011] In some embodiments, the methods include select-
ing, and optionally administering, a therapy comprising an
azole, eg, voriconazole, for a subject who has an A,
ﬁimigatus orA, terreus infection; or selecting, and optionally
administering, a therapy comprising aniphotericin B
(AMB), e.g., D-AMB or a lipid formulation of AME, for a
subject who has an A. calidoustus infection.

[0012] In another aspect, the invention provides methods
for monitoring efﬁcacy of a treatment for invasive aspergil-
losis (IA) in a subject. The methods include determining a
ﬁrst level of one, two, three, or more volatile organic
compounds (VOCs) produced by the Aspergillus species in
a sample comprising breath from the subject or headspace
from a culture suspected of comprising Aspergillus isolated
from the subject, wherein the VOCs are selected from the
group consisting of famesene, beta-vatirenene, cis-gerany-
lacetone, camphene, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene,
alpha-bergamotene, famesene, elixene, alpha-santalene,
beta-elemene, acoradien, chamigrene, 1,5,9-trimethyl
cyclododecatriene, 9-decene-2-one and beta-sesquiphellan-
drene, in the subject; administering a treatment for IA to the
subject; determining a second level of the VOCs in a sample
obtained aﬁer administration of the treatment to the subject;
and comparing the ﬁrst and second levels of VOCs. A
decrease in the VOCs indicates that the treatment has been
effective in treating the IA in the subject, and an increase or
no change indicates that the treatment has not been effective
in treating the IA in the subject.

[0013] In some embodiments, the treatment includes
administration of one or more doses of one or more anti-
fungal compounds, e.g., an amphotericin B formulation; an
azole compound; and an echinocandin.

[0014] In yet another aspect, the invention provides meth-
ods for identifying a candidate compound for the treatment
of [At The methods include providing a test culture com-
prising one or more Aspergillus species; detecting a baseline
level of fungal VOCs in the headspace of the culture in the
absence of the test compound, wherein the VOCs are
selected from the group consisting of famesene, beta-vat-
irenene, cis-geranylacetone, camphene, alpha-pinene, beta-
pinene, limonene, alpha-bergamotene, famesene, elixene,
alpha-santalene, beta-elemene, acoradien, chamigrene, 1,5,
9-trimethyl cyclododecatriene, 9-decene-2-one and beta-
sesquiphellandrene, in the subject; contacting the test culture
with a test compound; determining a second level of the
VOCs in a the test culture; comparing the second level of
VOCs to the baseline level; and identifying a test compound
that decreases levels of fungal VOCs in the test culture as a
candidate compound for the treatment of IA.

[0015] In another aspect, the invention provides methods
for detecting the presence of an Aspergillus fumigatus, A.
terreus. or A. calidouslus infection in a culture. The methods
include obtaining a sample from the culture, e.g., gas from
the headspace of the culture; determining the presence of
one, two, three, or more, e.g., all, of the VOCs selected from
the group consisting of camphene, alpha-pinene, beta-
pinene, limonene, alpha-bergamotene, farnesene, elixene,
alpha-santalene, beta-elemene, acoradien, chamigrene, 1,5,
9-trimethyl cyclododecatriene, 9-decene-2-one and beta-
sesquiphellandrene in the sample. The presence of one, two,
three, or more, eg, all, of camphene, alpha-pinene, beta-
pinene, limonene, alpha-bergamotene, or famesene indicates
the presence of A. fumigatus in the culture; the presence of
one, two, three, or more, e,g., all, of elixene, alpha-santal-
ene, beta-elemene, acoradien, chamigrene, and 1,5,9-trim-
ethyl cyclododecatriene indicates the presence of A. terreus
in the culture; and the presence of one or both of 9-decene-
2-one and beta-sesquiphellandrene indicates the presence of
A. calidoustus infection in the culture.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION

[0034] Pathogenic molds produce VOCs as part of their
normal metabolism. Agricultural and environmental health
industries have previously investigated the detection of
microbial VOCs to identify spoiled grain and mold-infested
‘sick buildings,’ respectively, and investigators in these
areas have noticed species-speciﬁc differences in the com-
position of VOCs emitted by molds in these settings.

[0035] As described herein, the present inventors have
identiﬁed unique, species-speciﬁc VOC proﬁles of A.
ﬁimigatus, A, terreus, and A. calidoustu: in vitro, including
several volatile terpene and sesquiterpene compounds that
can be used to discriminate these species from each other
and from other molds, and demonstrated that dilferential
mobility spectrometry (DMS) can be used for the rapid
discrimination of fungal species using pattem-based identi-
ﬁcation of these species-speciﬁc VOC proﬁles. The key
terpene and sesquiterpene compounds identiﬁed in in vitro
cultures of A. fumigatus were also present in the breath of
patients with IA, in addition to novel Aspergillus VOCs
induced in vivo, namely, the sesquiterpene beta-vatirenene
and the oxidized famesene derivative cis-geranylacetone. A
combination of farnesene, beta-vatirenene, and cis-gerany-
lacetone accurately distinguished patients with IA from
patients with other causes of pneumonia with 93% sensitiv-
ity and 96% speciﬁcity.

[0036] Detection of these unique VOC proﬁles can be
harnessed for species-level identiﬁcation of Aspergillus and
other mold species in the laboratory, and direct detection of
these fungal volatile proﬁles in the breath of patients with
suspected IA can be used for the rapid, noninvasive, highly
accurate, and species-speciﬁc diagnosis of IA and other
fungal pneumonias. The methods and devices described
herein, e.g., the DMS-based detection methods, can be
adapted to a small, portable bedside breath gas detection
system for real-time patient breath surveillance for this
pattern of fungal metabolites, to allow for earlier IA diag-
nosis than currently possible, more rational test-based pre-
scribing of antifungal medications, monitoring of clinical
response to antifungal therapy, and ultimately, better patient
outcomes.

Jan. 3], 2019

[0037] As described herein, among other uses, these VOC

proﬁles can be used for:

[0038] a. rapid, noninvasive, sensitive, and species-spe-
ciﬁc breath tests for the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis
and the discrimination of aspergillosis from other causes
of pneumonia in the growing population of immunocom-
promised patients at risk for invasive fungal infections;

[0039] b, surrogate marker demonstrating successful anti-
fungal treatment of IA, and

[0040] c. rapid identiﬁcation and antifungal susceptibility
testing of Aspergillus species, e.g., in the microbiology
laboratory, based on their VOC proﬁle (i.e,, the VOCs
present in the sample).

[004]] Invasive Aspergillosis

[0042] The methods described herein can be used to detect

or diagnose invasive aspergillosis (IA) in a subject, to select

treatment and to treat IA, and to monitor treatment of IA,

The methods can be used in the different forms of invasive

aspergillosis, including invasive pulmonary aspergillosis,

sinus or nasal aspergillosis, disseminated aspergillosis, and
single-organ invasive aspergillosis, e.g., of an organ in the
sino/nasal/respiratory tract (see, e.g., Walsh et al., Clinical

Infectious Diseases 2008; 46:327-60; Milroy et al., J Clin

Pathol, 1989 Febnrary; 42(2): 123-127). In preferred

embodiments, the methods described herein can be used for

subjects with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis.

[0043] Samples

[0044] The methods described herein can be performed on
a gas or liquid sample. In some embodiments, the sample is
exhaled breath directly from an individual or from a breath-
ing machine such as a ventilator, Alternatively, the methods
can be performed using headspace from a culture known or
suspected to include Arpergillur species, e.g., commercially-
available or lab-cultured species or species obtained from a
primary sample from a subject, e.g., a clinical sample
obtained by biopsy of the affected area (e.g., nasal biopsy,
transthoracic percutaneous needle aspiration, or video
assisted thoracoscopic biopsy) or bronchoalveolar lavage,
The sample is maintained in a suitable growth medium to
allow growth and metabolism of any Aspergillur species in
the sample. In certain embodiments, the invention involves
taking a clinical sample from a subject and placing it in
media, for example, with microﬂuidics, or in culture, for
example, with conventional culturing methods. The Aspar-
gillur species, if present, are stimulated to metabolize. The
headspace (gaseous phase) generated as a result of this
metabolism can be collected and analyzed using a method
described herein or known in the art, see, e.g.,
US20100291617. In some embodiments, the methods are
performed directly on bronchoalveolar washings, obtained
by bronchoscopy/bronchoalveolar lavage. In some embodi-
ments, the sample is a gas, e.g., patient breath or gas from
the headspace of an in vitro culture sample. Where head-
space gas is used, the gas should be collected after the
headspace has been in contact with the culture for a sufﬁ-
cient amount of time for the compounds to be present,
preferably in an air-tight, sealed environment.

[0045] The VOCs can also be detected in a liquid sample,
since they are expected to be there in equilibrium with the
gaseous phase. Thus, in addition to or as an alternative, the
samples assayed using the methods described herein can
include a liquid, e.g., blood (e.g., plasma or serum), lymph,
urine, tears, saliva, sputum, nasal mucus, phlegm (e.g.,
expectorate), or CSF from a subject (e.g., from a biological
US 2019/0033290 A1

crimp top incorporating a rubber septum. Cultures were
incubated for 24-144 hours at 200 rpm and 37° C. and
headspace gas was dynamically adsorbed, using argon car-
rier gas and an air sampling pump calibrated to 20 mL/min-
ute, onto Markes thermal desorption traps containing tan-
dem beds of Tenax TA (200 mg), Carbograph 1 TD (100
mg). and Carboxen 1003 (100 mg), optimized to retain
VOCs of diverse size and polarity,

[0083] Headspace VOCs were also collected after expo-
sure of a subset of fungal isolates to the antifungal drugs
voriconazole, liposomal amphotericin B, and micafungin,
each at a concentration of 1.0 mg/mL.

[0084] VOCs were desorbed onto a dual GC-MS/DMS
system (FIG. 1)ithe eluent from the gas chromatograph
was split between the MS, to allow identiﬁcation of each
compound, and the DMS, an extremely sensitive and selec-
tive gas detector that can be easily used as a point-of-care
gas detection device, to determine the mobility pattern for
each compound, The NIST MS Search 2.0 Library was used
to identify VOCs in the total ion chromatogram (TIC) of the
GC-MS data. Differences in spectral features of DMS output
were visually distinguished between the positive ion spectra
of A. fumigatus and A. terreu: and principal component
analysis (PCA) was used to evaluate the degree of class
discrimination between these fungal species using algo-
rithms in MATLAB (Version R2012a).

[0085] Collection of VOCs in Patient Breath

[0086] Breath was collected from patients with suspected
IA using a Loccioni Breath Analysis sampler. For each
patient. up to 4 minutes of tidal breath was adsorbed using
an an air sampling pump calibrated to 900 mL/minute onto
two parallel thermal desorption traps containing tandem
beds of Tenax TA (200 mg), Carbograph 1 TD (100 mg), and
Carboxen 1003 (100 mg). Ambient air was sampled con-
currently with each breath sample at a ﬂow rate of 900 mL
per minute to control for any environmental VOCs in patient
breath samples, These samples were analyzed using the
same thermal desorption GC-MS method outlined above for
the in vitro ﬁingal cultures.

[0087] Results

[0088] lntraspecies homogeneity, interspecies heterogene-
ity of VOC proﬁles:

[0089] Each mold species tested in vitro produced a dis-
tinctive VOC proﬁle that was conserved within each species
(FIG. 2A) and distinct between species (FIG. ZB). Terpene
and sesquiterpene compounds were particularly distinct
between diﬁerent fungal species.

[0090] Comparison of the VOC proﬁle of A. fumigatus
with other fungal species showed that camphene, alpha-
pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, alpha-bergamotene, and
famesene were characteristic of A. ﬁmiigatus (FIG. 3).
Comparison of the VOC proﬁle of A. :erreus with other
fungal species showed that elixene, alpha-santalene, beta-
elemene, acoradien, chamigrene, and 1,5,9-trimethyl
cyclododecatriene were key features characteristic of A.
terreus (FIG. 4). Comparison of the VOC proﬁle of A.
calia'oustus with other fungal species showed that 9-decene-
2-one and beta-sesquiphellandrene were key VOC features
characteristic of A. calidoustu: (FIG. 5).

[0091] Kinetics of VOC Production In Vitro:

[0092] The kinetics of VOC release were assessed in vitro
over lag, log, stationary, and death phases of each mold
species, over 24-144 hours of incubation at 37° C. The key
VOC features of A. fumigatus were ﬁrst clearly discernible

Jan. 31, 2019

at 24 hours of incubation and all volatiles reached their peak
concentration at 96 hours of incubation (FIG. 6).

[0093] The key VOC features of A. terreus were ﬁrst
clearly discernible at 48 hours of incubation and reached
peak levels at 96-120 hours of incubation (FIG. 7).

[0094] The key VOC features of A. calia'oustus were ﬁrst
clearly discernible at 24-48 hours of incubation and reached
their peak at 96 hours of incubation (FIG. 8).

[0095] Antifungal Exposure Modulates the Release of
VOCs in A.fumigatus:

[0096] Whether exposure to antifungal drugs might modu-
late VOC release in Aspergillus fumigatus was assessed in
vitro. When micafungin was added to 48-hour hyphal c111-
tures ofAfumigatus, up to a 17-fold increase in some of the
key A. fumigatus VOC features was observed after 24 hours,
compared to matched control samples without micafungin
(F 1G. 9A); attenuation of these VOC features was observed
with a longer duration of incubation and hyphal death. A
similar initial increase then attenuation in key A. ﬁJmigatus
VOCs was observed in response to liposomal amphotericin
B. When voriconazole was added to 48-hour hyphal cultures
of A, ﬂmigatus, near-complete attenuation of the key VOC
features of this species was observed after 24 hours, com-
pared to matched control samples without voriconazole
(FIG. 9B).

[0097] Deﬁnition of GC-Diiferential Mobility Spectrom-
eter Patterns of A. fumigatus and A. terreus:

[0098] As a step towards utilizing portable GC-differential
mobility spectrometry (DMS) technology as a point-of-care
gas detector torAspergillus, the eluent from the GC was split
between a MS and a DMS device. DMS is an extremely
sensitive and selective chemical detector that operates at
atmospheric pressure with a small power source, allowing it
to be used outside the laboratory for the detection of speciﬁc
VOC patterns. DMS positive ion spectral features of head-
space gas fromA, ﬁtmigatus and A. terreus were examined,
The DMS pattern was clearly conserved Within members of
each species and clearly distinct between A.fumigatur and
A. terreu: (FIG. 10A, 10B).

[0099] Using principal component analysis (PCA), the
degree of class separation between A. fumigatus and A.
terreu: was evaluated. There was clustering of samples from
the same species, and clear separation between A.ﬁ4migatus
and A. terreu: clusters (FIG. 11A, 11B).

[0100] Detection of A. ﬁxmigatus VOCs in Patient Breath:
[0101] Tidal breath was collected from 54 immunocom-
promised patients with suspected invasive aspergillosis to
assess whether patients with IA could be distinguished from
patients without IA by detecting fungal VOCs in their
breath,

[0102] Of 54 patients, 23 (43%) were female, 46 (85%)
had a hematologic malignancy, 22 (41%) allogeneic stem
cell transplants, 6 (11%) solid organ transplants, 46 (85%)
exposure to T—cell immunosuppressants, and 24 (44%) pro-
longed neutropenia. These characteristics were comparable
in 29 patients with EORTC/MSG proven (3) or probable
(26) IA and 25 patients with nodular pneumonia caused by
other fungal infections or other infectious processes.
[0103] There was substantial overlap between the key A.
ﬁxmigatus VOCs we identiﬁed in vitro and in the breath of
patients with invasive aspergillosis (FIG. 12), although we
also identiﬁed a new sesquiterpene compound, beta-vat-
irenene, and an oxidized famesene derivative, cis—gerany-
US 2019/0033290 A1

unrelated test compounds. In some embodiments, the test
compounds are peptide or peptidomimetic molecules. In
some embodiments, the test compounds are nucleic acids.

[0072] In some embodiments, the test compounds and
libraries thereof can be obtained by systematically altering
the structure of a ﬁrst test compound, e.g., a ﬁrst test
compound that is structurally similar to a known natural
binding partner of the target polypeptide, or a ﬁrst small
molecule identiﬁed as capable of binding the target poly-
peptide, eg., using methods known in the art or the methods
described herein, and correlating that structure to a resulting
biological activity, e.g., a structure-activity relationship
study. As one of skill in the art will appreciate, there are a
variety of standard methods for creating such a structure-
activity relationship. Thus. in some instances, the work may
be largely empirical, and in others, the three-dimensional
structure of an endogenous polypeptide or portion thereof
can be used as a starting point for the rational design of a
small molecule compound or compounds. For example, in
one embodiment, a general library of small molecules is
screened, erg, using the methods described herein.

[0073] In some embodiments, a test compound is applied
to a test sample comprising one or more Aspergillus species,
and the ability of the test compound to decrease levels of a
VOC as described herein in the headspace of the culture is
determined.

[0074] In some embodiments, the test sample is, or is
derived from (e.g., a sample taken from) an in vivo model
of a disorder as described herein. For example, an animal
model, e.g., a rodent (such as a rat or mouse) that has been
infected with one or more Aspergillus species can be used.
[0075] A test compound that has been screened by a
method described herein and determined to decrease VOCs,
can be considered a candidate compound, A candidate
compound that has been screened, e.g., in an in vivo model
of a disorder, e.g., a rodent infected with one or more
Aspergillu: species, and determined to decrease VOCs in a
sample comprising breath from the infected animal model or
headspace from a culture of a sample from the infected
animal model, can be considered a candidate therapeutic
agent. Candidate therapeutic agents, once screened in a
clinical setting, are therapeutic agents. Candidate com-
pounds, candidate therapeutic agents, and therapeutic agents
can be optionally optimized and/or derivatized, and fonnu-
lated with physiologically acceptable excipients to form
pharmaceutical compositions,

[007 6] Thus, test compounds identiﬁed as “hits” (e.g., test
compounds that decrease fungal VOCs in an animal model)
in a ﬁrst screen can be selected and systematically altered,
e.g., using rational design, to optimize binding afﬁnity,
avidity, speciﬁcity, or other parameter. Such optimization
can also be screened for using the methods described herein.
Thus, in one embodiment, the invention includes screening
a ﬁrst library of compounds using a method known in the art
and/or described herein, identifying one or more hits in that
library, subjecting those hits to systematic structural altera-
tion to create a second library of compounds structurally
related to the hit, and screening the second library using the
methods described herein

[0077] Test compounds identiﬁed as hits can be consid-
ered candidate therapeutic compounds, useful in treating IA.
A variety of techniques useful for determining the structures
of “hits” can be used in the methods described herein, e.g.,
NMR, mass spectrometry, gas chromatography equipped

Jan. 3], 2019

with electron capture detectors, ﬂuorescence and absorption
spectroscopy. Thus, the invention also includes compounds
identiﬁed as “hits” by the methods described herein, and
methods for their administration and use in the treatment,
prevention, or delay of development or progression of a
disorder described herein.

[0078] Test compounds identiﬁed as candidate therapeutic
compounds can be further screened by administration to an
animal model of IA, as described herein. The animal can be
monitored for a change in the disorder, e.g., for an improve-
ment in a parameter of the disorder, eg, a parameter related
to clinical outcome. In some embodiments, the parameter is
VOCs or survival, and an improvement would be a reduction
in VOCs or an increase in survival. In some embodiments,
the subject is a human, e.g., a human with [A and the
parameter is levels of fungal VOCs or survival

Deﬁnition of Aspergillus VOC Proﬁles In Vitro

[0080] Using gas chromatography interfaced to mass
spectrometry and differential mobility spectrometry (GC-
MS/DMS), VOC proﬁles were characterized in the head-
space gas of in vitro cultures of Aspergillus species patho-
genic to humans, most notably Ar jitmigatus, Ar terreus, and
A. calidourtus, under incubation conditions designed to
mimic the milieu of the human lung and promote hyphal
growth (as Aspergillus spreads through hyphal growth and
invasion of human tissue blood vessels and tissues in vivo),
[0081] Mold strains (Table 1) were incubated at 25° C. on
Sabouraud dextrose agar slants. Conidia were harvested and
conidial suspensions were prepared in sterile water Conidia
were quantiﬁed with a hemocytometer

minimal media (Pontecorvo et al., Advan Genet 1953;

tissue or organ that is known or suspected to be infected with
an Aspergillus species), or the liquid phase (e.g., superna-
tant) of an in vitro culture. In some embodiments, the sample
comprises saliva from the subject.

[004 6] Detection Methods

[0047] A number of methods known in the art can be used
to detect the presence of the VOCs described herein in a
sample. Exemplary methods (particularly for use with a gas
sample) include gas chromatography (GC); spectrometry,
for example mass spectrometry (including quadrapole, time
of ﬂight, tandem mass spectrometry, ion cyclotron reso-
nance, and/or sector (magnetic and/or electrostatic», ion
mobility spectrometry, ﬁeld asymmetric ion mobility spec-
trometry, and/or DMS; fuel cell electrodes; light absorption
spectroscopy; nanoparticle technology; ﬂexural plate wave
(FPW) sensors; electrochemical sensors; photoacoustic
equipment; laser-based equipment; electronic noses (bio-
derived, surface coated); and various ionization techniques.
See, e.g., US20100291617 and U820070003996. Preferred
methods include ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) or itfer-
ential mobility spectrometry (DMS).

[0048] In some embodiments, the methods described
herein include the use of differential mobility spectrometry
to detect VOCs in a sample. An exemplary micro-mac iined
differential mobility spectrometer (DMS), developed for
chemical and biological sensing applications, is currently
available from Sionex Corporation. DMS has severa fea-
tures that make it an excellent platform for VOC analysis: it
is quantitative, selective, and exquisitely sensitive, with a
volatile detection limit in the parts-per-tr‘illion range (Davis
et al., In: 12th International Conference on Transducers,
Solid-State Sensors, Actuators and Microsystems; 2003; p.
1233-8 vol. 2; Miller et al., In: Solid-State Sensors and
Actuators Workshop; 2000; Hilton Head, SC; 2000; (rebs
et al., Sensors Journal, IEEE 2005; 5(4):696-703). Unlike
mass spectrometry, which separates particles based on mass/
charge ratios, DMS harnesses differences in ion mobi ity in
low and high electric ﬁelds to achieve a gas-phase separation
of ions at atmospheric pressure. DMS rapidly detects com-
pounds that are diﬂicult to resolve by other ana ytical
techniques such as mass spectrometry in challenging matri-
ces such as human breath (Kanu et al., J Mass Spectrom
2008; 43:1-22; Kanu et al., J ChromatogrA 2008; 1177:12-
27; Luong J et al., J Chromatogr Sci 2006; 44:276-286;
Nazarov et al., Anal Chem 2006; 7697-706; Kolakowski et
al., Analyst 2007; 132:842-64).

[0049] DMS can be tuned to monitor speciﬁc ion masses,
thus tailoring response characteristics to focus on various
compounds of interest. It requires no reagents, generates the
high ﬁelds required by the sensor using a small power
supply, and has already been microfabricated, resulting in a
small, portable machine that can be used at the bedside, with
a turnaround time of several minutes. DMS has been used
successfully in several commercial settings, including a
hand-held, portable detector of trace levels of chemical
warfare agents from General Dynamics (JUNOTM) and
airport explosives detectors from Thermo (see, e.g., US
Pat. No. 7,605,367). DMS technology has also been suc-
cessfully applied to the characterization of unique VOCs
produced by Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other bacteria
(Fong et al., Anal Chem 2011; 83:1537-46; Shnayderman et
al., Anal Chem 2005;77:5930-7).

 

Jan. 3], 2019

[0050] To perform a measurement using a DMS, a gas
sample is introduced into the spectrometer, where it is
ionized, and the ions are transported through an ion ﬁlter
towards the detecting electrodes (Faraday plates) by a carrier
gas. The DMS device can separate chemical components of
a substance based on differing ion mobilities. For other
devices, measurements are performed using methods known
in the art.

[0051] Additional non-limiting examples of systems that
can be used in the present methods include those described
in U820090078865; U820130168548; U820100291617 and
USZOO70003996.

[0052] In some embodiments, the methods include obtain-
ing a sample of ambient air and detecting the presence
and/or levels of VOCs in the air, to provide a reference for
subtraction of ambient VOCs.

[0053] A number of methods are known in the art for
detecting the presence and/or levels of the VOCs in a liquid
sample, including but not limited to chromatography (eg,
HPLC) and spectrophotometry (e.g., MS, LC-MS, MALDI-
TOF, and other of the methods described above for gas-
phase samples).

[0054] Combination Diagnostics

[0055] In some embodiments, the methods include per-
forming an additional diagnostic test for IA. A number of
such tests are known in the art and include galactomanrian
enzyme imrnurioassays; radiology imaging studies (e.g., CT
imaging); bronchoalveolar lavage, transthoracic percutarie-
ous needle aspiration, or video assisted thoracoscopic
biopsy. A positive result on one of these tests can provide
further evidence supporting a diagnosis of IA; see, e.g.,
Walsh et al., Clinical Infectious Diseases 2008; 46:327-60.

[0056] Aspergillus Species Identiﬁcation and Diagnosis
[0057] As described herein, A. fumigatus, A. terreus, A.
calidoustu: each produce VOCs that can be used to identify
them in a sample, e.g., in a sample comprising breath of a
subject, or headspace from a culture suspected of comprising
Aspergillus; the culture can be, e.g., a culture of a biopsy
from a subject, or a culture in a microbiology laboratory,
e.g., a culture known or suspected of containing or being
contaminated with an Aspergillu: species. This identiﬁcation
can be used to diagnose a subject with the speciﬁc species
of Aspergillus, allowing for the administration of species-
speciﬁc treatments, e.g., as described below.

[0058] Thus, the methods described herein can include
obtaining a sample comprising breath of a subject, or
headspace from a culture suspected ofcomprising Aspergil-
11.43, and detecting and identifying the VOCs in the sample.
For example, the methods can include detecting the presence
of one, two, three, or more, e.g., all, of camphene, alpha-
pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, alpha-bergamotene,
famesene, elixene, alpha-santalene, beta-elemene, acora-
dien, chamigrene, 1,5,9-trimethyl cyclododecatriene, 9-de-
cene-2-one and beta-sesquiphellandrene in the sample. The
presence of one, two, three, or more, e.g., all, of camphene,
alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, alpha-bergamotene, or
famesene indicates the presence of A. fumigatus in the
sample (and thus an A. ﬁmigarus infection in cases where
the sample is from a subject); the presence of one, two, three,
or more, e.g., all, of elixene, alpha-santalene, beta-elemene,
acoradien, chamigrene, and 1,5,9-trimethyl cyclododeca-
triene indicates the presence of A. terreus in the sample (and
thus an A. terreus infection in cases where the sample is
from a subject); and the presence of one or both of 9-decene-
US 2019/0033290 A1

2-one and beta-sesquiphellandrene indicates the presence of
A. calidoustus in the sample (and thus an A. calidoustus
infection in cases where the sample is from a subject). In
some embodiments, where limonene or alpha-pinene is
present, at least one or two other VOCs must also be present
for a positive species identiﬁcation, and a species-speciﬁc
diagnosis, to be made,

[0059] Methods of Treatment

[0060] The methods described herein can be used to select
a treatment for a subject, and can optionally include admin-
istering the treatment to a subject, When a subject has been
diagnosed by a method described herein as having IA, then
a treatment comprising administration of a therapeutically
effective amount of an antifungal compound can be admin-
istered.

[0061] A number of antifungal compounds are known in
the art and under development, At present, deoxycholate
amphotericin B (D-AMB) and its lipid formulations (AMB
lipid complex (ABLC), liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB),
and Amphotericin B cholesteryl sulfate complex (AMB
colloidal dispersion, ABCD)); azole compounds (itracon-
azole, voriconazole, posaconazole); and echinocandins
(caspofungin, micafungirt anidulafungin) are in clinical use,
though voriconazole and D-AMB are the only compounds
approved for primary treatment of invasive aspergillosis in
the United States, For detailed information on treatment of
IA, see, eg, Walsh et al., Clinical Infectious Diseases 2008;
46:327-60; and Marr et al,, Treatment and prevention of
invasive aspergillasis, Up-To-Date (topic updated on Oct.
18, 2012; literature review August 2013; available at upto-
date,com/contents/treatment-and-prevention-of-invasive-
aspergillosis?topicKey:ID%2F2459&elapsedTimeMs:
7&view:print&displayedView:full).

[0062] In some embodiments, the methods include select-
ing and optionally administering an azole antifungal, e,g.,
itraconazole (ITR), voriconazole (VOR), posaconazole
(POS), ravuconazole (RAV), or isavuconazole (ISA), or an
amphotericin B (AMB) formulation as described above, to
a subject identiﬁed by a method described herein as having
IA. In some embodiments, the methods include administer-
ing an echinocandin, e.g,, caspofungin, micafungin or anidu-
lafungin, cg, alone or in combination with an azole (e.g.,
voriconazole) or AMB.

[0063] It is known that triazoles are not active against
some isolates of Ar calidaustus, and some A, terreu: isolates
are resistant to AME. See, e.g., Baddley et al., J. Clin.
Microbiol. 2009, 47(10):3271. Thus, in some embodiments,
where the species of Aspergillus is determined, an azole
compound (e.g., ITR, VOR, POS, RAV, or ISA) is selected
for (and optionally administered to) a subject who has A.
fumigatus or A. terreus, but not At mlidoustus, In some
embodiments, an AMB (elgi, D-AMB, ABLC, LAMB, or
ABCD) is selected for (and optionally administered to) a
subject who has A. calia'oustus. In some embodiments, an
AMB is selected for (and optionally administered to) a
subject who has A, fitmigatus, but not a subject who has A.
terreus.

[0064] In some embodiments, the methods described
herein can be used to determine susceptibility of Aspergillus
species, eg, to treatment with a known or suspected anti-
fungal, eg, in the microbiology laboratory, A sample sus-
pected or known to include Aspergillus from a subject is
obtained and cultured as described above, e.g., under con-
ditions mimicking the in vivo environment, and then

exposed to a potential treatment (e.g,, a known or experi-
mental treatment), Aﬁer exposure to the treatment, the
VOCs present in the headspace of the culture are sampled,
If the treatment decreases VOCs as compared to a reference
level (e.g., a level of VOCs in the headspace before expo sure
to the treatment), then the Aspergillu: in the sample is
considered susceptible to the treatment In this case, the
treatment is likely to be effective in treating IA in the
subject; the treatment can be selected and optionally admin-
istered to subject

[0065] Monitoring Treatment Efﬁcacy

[0066] As described herein, successful treatment of an
Aspergillus infection results in a decrease in fungal VOCs.
Thus, the methods can include repeated assays of VOC
levels in a subject, e.g., before, during, and alter adminis-
tration of a treatment for IA, A decrease in VOC levels
would indicate that the treatment has been successful. In
some embodiments, levels of one, two, or all three of
famesene, beta-vatirenene, and/or cis-geranylacetone are
determined, In some embodiments, levels of one, two, three,
or more of famesene, beta-vatirenene, cis-geranylacetone,
camphene, alpha-pinene, beta-pinene, limonene, alpha-ber-
garnotene, famesene, elixene, alpha-santalene, beta-el-
emene, acoradien, chamigrene, 1,5,9-trimethyl cyclodode-
catriene, 9-decene-2-one and beta-sesquiphellandrene are
determined,

[0067] Methods of Identifying Novel Antifungal Agents
[0068] Included herein are methods for screening test
compounds, erg, polypeptides, polynucleotides, inorganic
or organic large or small molecule test compounds, to
identify agents useful in the treatment of IA.

[0069] As used herein, “small molecules” refers to small
organic or inorganic molecules of molecular weight below
about 3,000 Daltons. In general, small molecules useful for
the invention have a molecular weight of less than 3,000
Daltons (Da), The small molecules can be, eg,, from at least
about 100 Da to about 3,000 Da (eg, between about 100 to
about 3,000 Da, about 100 to about 2500 Da, about 100 to
about 2,000 Da, about 100 to about 1,750 Da, about 100 to
about 1,500 Da, about 100 to about 1,250 Da, about 100 to
about 1,000 Da, about 100 to about 750 Da. about 100 to
about 500 Da, about 200 to about 1500, about 500 to about
1000, about 300 to about 1000 Da, or about 100 to about 250
Da).

[0070] The test compounds can be, e,g,, natural products
or members of a combinatorial chemistry library. A set of
diverse molecules should be used to cover a variety of
functions such as charge, aromaticity, hydrogen bonding,
ﬂexibility, size, length of side chain, hydrophobicity, and
rigidity. Combinatorial techniques suitable for synthesizing
small molecules are known in the art, e.g., as exempliﬁed by
Obrecht and Villalgordo, Solid-Supported Combinatorial
and Parallel Synthesis of Small-Molecular-l/Veight Come
pound Libraries, Pergamon-Elsevier Science Limited
(1998), and include those such as the “split and pool” or
“parallel” synthesis techniques, solid-phase and solution-
phase techniques, and encoding techniques (see, for
example, Czamik, Curr. Opin. Chem. Bio. 1260-6 (1997)). In
addition, a number of small molecule libraries are commer-
cially available. A number of suitable small molecule test
compounds are listed in US. Pat, No, 6,503,713, incorpo-
rated herein by reference in its entirety

[0071] Libraries screened using the methods of the present
invention can comprise a variety of types of test compounds.
A given library can comprise a set of structurally related or
